      Does Beeminder sound super crazypants? Just confusing? One of the first
      things you may want to check out is our <a

        >User's Guide for New Bees</a

      below. If you're a glutton for honey, the "bee-all" tag has everything we
      still think is worth reading. Other good ones are the "rationality" and

    <h3>Akrasia</h3>
    <p>
      Akrasia (ancient Greek ἀκρασία, "lacking command over oneself"; adjective:
      "akratic") is the state of acting against one's better judgment, not doing
      what one genuinely wants to do. It encompasses procrastination, lack of
      self-control, lack of follow-through, and any kind of addictive behavior.
