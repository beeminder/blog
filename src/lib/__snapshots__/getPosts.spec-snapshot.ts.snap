    two kinds of accountability
  </a>
  . 
Beeminder embodies hard accountability: committing to doing something (often with consequences if you don&#8217;t). 
My app,
  <a
    href=\\"https://complice.co\\"
    title=\\"We usually pronounce it like &#39;accomplice&#39; without the &#39;uh&#39; but if you&#39;re fancy (or French) you can say &#39;com-pleece&#39;\\"
  >
    Complice
  </a>
  ,
embodies soft accountability: 
committing to assessing and reporting on whether you&#8217;ve done something. 
So when you miss a deadline, you&#8217;ve failed at the hard accountability.
But it&#8217;s not too late to succeed at the soft accountability component!
And in cases where you&#8217;re accountable to another person, this means being proactive about getting in touch with them.
This tends to be hard and scary, and
  <em>
    also
  </em>
  very important in the long-term for your work itself and for your working relationship with your accountability-holder.
</p>
<p>
  An article on

    title=\\"The Systems Thinker: Moving from Blame to Accountability\\"
  >
    shifting from blame to accountability
  </a>
  defines accountability as 
&#8220;the process of assigning responsibilities for a situation in advance&#8221;
and notes:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    &#8220;Accountability comes from clear contracting, ongoing conversations, and an organizational commitment to support accountability rather than blame.&#8221;
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  If you&#8217;ve used Beeminder, you know the importance of clear contracting. 
(And for more on transcending blame, check out that article.)
What I&#8217;m talking about today is the &#8220;ongoing conversations&#8221; piece, from the perspective of the person being held accountable.
</p>
<p>
  The key is this: hard-commit to regularly giving status updates to your accountability partner.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  Commit to regularly giving status updates to your accountability partner &#8212; even if you don&#8217;t like the status of things
</h4>
<p>
  When you&#8217;re on top of things, this is easy:
&#8220;Hey friend, remember that thing I said I&#8217;d do? Well, here it is!&#8221; 
So I don&#8217;t need to convince you to do that.
</p>
<p>
  When you slip behind, though, it can start to feel embarrassing, or even shameful. 
So not only will you not really feel like messaging them yourself, you&#8217;ll be tempted to not&#8230; reply&#8230; to their messages&#8230; just yet&#8230; but in a little bit&#8230; maybe once you catch up&#8230;
</p>
<p>
  But ideally you have an accountability buddy who is sufficiently on top of things that they will notice whatever it was you didn&#8217;t do. 
(Otherwise your accountability system won&#8217;t be that reliable in the first place.)
And so you can build trust and self-trust by communicating clearly, even when you&#8217;re behind.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    &#8220;What is true is already so. 
Owning up to it doesn&#8217;t make it worse. 
Not being open about it doesn&#8217;t make it go away. 
And because it&#8217;s true, it is what is there to be interacted with. 
Anything untrue isn&#8217;t there to be lived. 
People can stand what is true, 
for they are already enduring it.&#8221; &#8212;

<p>
  If you&#8217;ve missed the deadline (or it&#8217;s 2 days before the deadline and you know you won&#8217;t hit it) then
  <em>
    that&#8217;s what&#8217;s real
  </em>
  . 
And it&#8217;s real whether you keep an open line of communication with your accountability keeper or not. 
So while it&#8217;s tempting to think
  <em>
    if I don&#8217;t look at it, maybe it&#8217;ll go away
  </em>
  , that&#8217;s not actually what will happen. 
What will go away is your sense of connection and trust with the other person &#8212; especially if they reach out to you and don&#8217;t hear back.
And you&#8217;ll also find it a lot harder to redouble your efforts to ensure the thing that you committed to, which presumably was important to you, actually happens.
</p>
<p>
  When I&#8217;ve written before about hard &amp; soft commitments, I&#8217;ve portrayed them as relatively separate.
I say that Beeminder is based on hard accountability and Complice on soft accountability, but they also go together when doing interpersonal accountability.
</p>
<p>
  So when you reach the deadline and you haven&#8217;t done the thing, then
  <em>
    what is true
  </em>
  is that you haven&#8217;t done the thing.
Too late to change that &#8212; you&#8217;ve failed at the hard accountability component of your obligation. 
But by being proactive about getting in touch with the other person,
  <em>
    you can still succeed at the soft accountability component
  </em>
  . 
It&#8217;s also a necessary component for figuring out how to proceed in light of what happened.
</p>
<h2>
  A positive example
</h2>
<p>
  I&#8217;ll give an example of this principle being followed and it going really well. 
I was working on a project with a partner and they agreed to complete their part within a week. 
Six days later, I got a reply:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, this is the busiest week/window of all the weeks/windows since you&#8217;ve known me 
[this seemed pretty reasonable given I knew they were starting a new job]. 
If you feel like delaying an extra three or four days, I can all but guarantee that I can give this the attention it deserves. 
But if you want to stick to your original schedule, I must shamefully admit to social unreliability. 
I&#8217;ve got deadlines in three directions, and I&#8217;m running low on cycles.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  I really enjoyed receiving this email. 
My deadline wasn&#8217;t a super strict one. 
My friend postponing did mean I needed to find something else to publish to satisfy my Beeminder blog-post-publishing goal. 
But it was fine. 
Now let&#8217;s consider what might have happened if they&#8217;d been less on top of things.
</p>
<p>
  On day seven or eight, I would have sent my friend an email checking in. 
Me having to do this isn&#8217;t a big deal; I have a good system for managing this kind of thing without wasting too much attention. 
If I got a prompt, clear reply to my check-in email, that&#8217;d be almost as good as them having contacted me proactively. 
But if I don&#8217;t&#8230;
</p>
<p>
  &#8230;do I send them another email a day or two later? 
If the context is a purely accountability-oriented one (rather than a project with a friend), then I probably do, because that&#8217;s the whole point of my role: to hold them accountable. 
But in this sort of situation, I would have been left confused.
Do I finish the project on my own? Do I wait a bit longer? 
This choice is much easier to make if I had even a sentence or two from the other person, like this friend gave me in this instance: 
&#8220;If you can delay 3-4 days, I can make it happen; if not, then I flake&#8221;. 
That makes it really clear.
Your situation may not always be this clear, but however clear it is, you can always communicate whatever you&#8217;ve got!
</p>
<h2>
  A negative example
</h2>
<p>
  Here&#8217;s an example where lack of communication led to a total breakdown in collaboration. 
Mid-2014, I had a pact partnership with a new friend, where we&#8217;d both committed to writing a thousand words daily. 
Any day we
  <em>
    didn&#8217;t
  </em>
  write those thousand words, we had to pay the other person $100.
This worked really well for about a month, and I wrote much more than I ever had before.
</p>
<p>
  What happened about a month in? 
Well, I got behind a couple of days, and I was kind of freaking out, hoping my friend wouldn&#8217;t notice. 
I would catch up for yesterday, but not do enough to cover today as well, so I spent several days being potentially on the hook for $100 if my friend had noticed. 
But in the meantime&#8230; he hadn&#8217;t updated our shared spreadsheet in several days himself. 
Finally I just sent him an email with the subject: 
&#8220;According to the information I have, I owe you $100, and you owe me $700&#8221; 
(though we had as part of the agreement that mutual payments went elsewhere rather than canceling each other out). 
He took two days to get back to that and said something like
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    yeah&#8230; writing doesn&#8217;t seem that high priority to me right now&#8230; I have some other time-sensitive opportunities.
It wasn&#8217;t laziness but a change of tactic. 
How about on my end we switch to a system whereby I state 3 big tasks each day and then I follow up on those?
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Sure, I would&#8217;ve been open to that&#8230; 9 days earlier, when he stopped writing. 
As it was, his absenteeism had made me trust the system less, because a bunch of my motivation had come from the idea that he might catch me missing the date. 
Although of course, I hadn&#8217;t lately been perfect myself, which didn&#8217;t exactly aid my trust in the system either.
</p>
<p>
  I tried writing a bit more on my own, and this worked for a few days but then I flagged. 
I sent him another email saying &#8220;look, let&#8217;s start fresh&#8221;, and he just didn&#8217;t reply.
</p>
<p>
  And my daily writing habit silently died while I was waiting for a response.
</p>
<p>
  Of course, there are a bunch of points where I could have behaved better in this instance too. 
I chose this example not because it highlights one clear failure that could have been addressed, but rather because it was a total mess. 
A bunch of money was on the line that never got paid. 
My habit broke, because I was relying on this external system which ultimately wasn&#8217;t functional. 
And, well, I still think this guy is competent in general, but I&#8217;d be more wary of working with him. 
I definitely wouldn&#8217;t do another pact with him.
</p>
<p>
  This pact was an opportunity for the two of us to

  </a>
  : 
Sebastian Marshall&#8217;s take on an old Aristotle quote about friendship, that points at the special kind of rapport that comes from working together under stress. 
So if we&#8217;d been a bit more proactive, we could have not just written way more blog posts apiece but also developed a high-trust relationship we could leverage in future projects.
</p>
<p>
  That would have been totally worth it even if we&#8217;d each lost a few hundred dollars.

</p>
<p>
  It&#8217;s not reasonable to expect to never miss a single deadline ever. 
It&#8217;s a thing to aim for, of course. 
And possibly to aim for
  <em>
    really intently
  </em>
  &#8212; but not so intently that you go into denial if it happens.
</p>
<p>
  Because it will happen, and once it happens, what matters is recognizing the situation, communicating really clearly and figuring out what it makes sense to do next.
And it&#8217;s in that acknowledgement that you&#8217;re behind, stuck, or unsure that you keep them in the loop as your accountability
  <em>
    partner

<p>
  Beeminder&#8217;s Achilles heel is that you need a meta-Beeminder to get yourself to create a Beeminder goal in the first place.
(We sometimes call it Beeminder&#8217;s bootstrap problem.)
</p>
<p>
  Here&#8217;s a trick to mitigate that problem:
Create a goal as soon as you think of it, but with an initial flat spot of a week or a month or however much time you need for it to not feel daunting.
</p>
<p>
  You might even want to do that now, with a 17-day flat spot ending January 1st, for any new year&#8217;s resolution goals you might want to create.
</p>
<p>
  (
  <strong>
    Important
  </strong>
  : When creating the goal, pick an aggressive slope for after the long initial flat spot. 
Otherwise you may keep your head in the sand indefinitely, with the goal never forcing you to do more than you would&#8217;ve anyway!)
</p>
<p>
  The idea is to overcome the activation energy. 
Lock yourself in, but in a way that you don&#8217;t have to actually do anything until next month.
You know, &#8220;when you&#8217;ll be less busy&#8221;.

    :
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
    You create a goal with 30 days of initial flat spot and start adding data at whatever rate feels comfortable. 
After a while, retroactively steepen that yellow brick road with the

    >

    to match your data. 
At that point you can decide: 
Do you want to commit to maintaining that rate? Push harder? Back off? 
You now have data to support the decision!

  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
    This was meant to be a nice simple blog post encouraging people to think ahead to their new year&#8217;s resolutions but I seem to be incapable of writing posts like that. 
So now I guess it&#8217;s about retroactive road adjustments and hypothetical auto-dialers.
At least I circumscribed the excessive nerdery in a sidebar!
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
    The point is, our future auto-dialer is going to be amazing but you can have a slight taste of it now:
Start your goal flat, gather data, and adjust the slope retroactively to what turns out to be realistic.

    2019 Survivor Challenge
  </a>
  ?
We&#8217;ve been crowing about this in various places but we should do that here on the blog as well!
</p>
<p>
  We&#8217;ve sent out all the prizes, which we think are pretty great.
Congratulations to the winners!
And thanks for proving that Beeminder is drastically better (than the alternative of resolving really hard?) for new year&#8217;s resolutions!
</p>
<p>
  How much better? 
Well, Survivor goals (counting the runners-up who derailed but got back on the horse at a higher pledge) had a 44% success rate. 
44% may not sound like much but in terms of fraction of new year&#8217;s resolution goals that last
  <em>
    an entire year
  </em>
  , that&#8217;s pretty dang good, right?
</p>
<p>
  Finally, an extra shoutout to the runners-up AKA penultimate survivors: 
As we argue in

    title=\\"AKA Beeminder Revenue Proportional To User Awesomeness\\"
  >
    Derailing Is Not Failing
  </a>
  &#8221;, they might actually be the most impressive. 
They&#8217;re the ones who set goals ambitious enough to sometimes derail on! 
Anyway, the
  <em>
    real
  </em>
  prize is the friendships we, no wait, the real prize is doing more of what&#8217;s important to us. 
Still schmaltzy, still true! 
Beeminder is life-changing stuff, as you all know. 
But also congrats one more time to the 2019 Survivors!
</p>
<p>
  Now go create some goals for 2021!

  Many of us have a problem following through on our intentions.
And it&#8217;s more than just a difficulty in predicting our future desires.
It&#8217;s not like &#8220;Gee, I thought I wanted to get in shape but it turned out there was always something really good on TV!&#8221;
No, even in hindsight, you regret not doing what you said you wanted to do.
It&#8217;s not even that you&#8217;re merely conflicted about what you want.
The trade-off you made &#8212; more TV watched, still not in shape &#8212; was patently ridiculous.
You somehow don&#8217;t do what you genuinely want to do.
Philosophers back to Plato and Aristotle have a fancy term for this paradoxical failure of the will:

It encompasses procrastination, lack of self-control, lack of follow-through, and any kind of addictive behavior.
Another way to define
  <em>
    akrasia
  </em>
  is by generalizing from procrastination to include
  <em>
    preproperation
  </em>
  as well.
Procrastination is the irrational delay of tasks with immediate cost and delayed benefit.
Preproperation is the irrational
  <em>
    not

  delaying of (overindulgence in) activities with immediate benefit and delayed cost.

    study on grocery-buying habits
  </a>
  :
When buying groceries online for delivery tomorrow people buy a lot more ice cream and a lot fewer vegetables than when they&#8217;re ordering for delivery next week.
In other words, our preferences are inconsistent &#8212; in fact, logically contradictory &#8212; over time.
Your ability to weigh the costs and benefits (yumminess, healthiness) is severely compromised when some of those costs or benefits are immediate, which is why the ice cream vs vegetables decision plays out so differently when you decide it from a distance.

  Commitment device: A way to change one&#8217;s own incentives to make an otherwise empty promise credible.
</h4>
<p>
  How do we solve this problem?
The answer is
  <em>
    self-binding
  </em>
  , that is, the use of
  <em>
    commitment devices
  </em>
  .
The term
  <em>
    commitment device
  </em>
  is from game theory and applies to strategic situations.
It refers to a way of changing one&#8217;s own incentives to make an otherwise empty threat or promise credible.
This can be quite rational.  A classic example is from
  <a
    href=\\"http://books.google.com/books?id=7RkL4Z8Yg5AC\\"
    title=\\"Schelling's famous book, Strategy of Conflict\\"
  >
    Thomas Schelling
  </a>
  , who pioneered this aspect of game theory.
You&#8217;ve been kidnapped and you&#8217;d like to promise your kidnapper that if they let you go you won&#8217;t rat them out to the police.
The promise is useless because the kidnapper knows you&#8217;ll have no incentive to keep it once you&#8217;re free (and so they won&#8217;t set you free).
But if you can change your future incentives (implicate yourself in the crime, perhaps?) then suddenly your promise can carry weight.

  </a>
  Limiting your future options by voluntarily imposing consequences on your future self can be quite valuable in a strategic negotiation or conflict.
</p>
<p>
  But it&#8217;s hard to characterize as rational the use of self-binding with no one but
  <em>
    oneself
  </em>
  &#8230; 
until you appreciate that there&#8217;s in fact more than just
  <em>
    one
  </em>
  self.

  Sapid Sweets and Seductive Sirens
</h2>
<p>
  Here&#8217;s a ubiquitous example.  Why not save money by buying bulk-size candy?  It&#8217;s technically entirely irrational not to.
You should buy the bulk size, save the money, and then ration it to match the pace you&#8217;d eat it at when buying the individual sizes.
Same consumption rate, less cost. The problem is your future self won&#8217;t
  <em>
    be
  </em>
  rational with a pile of candy in the house.

    Sugar is a bit addictive, after all.
  </a>
  So it&#8217;s worth spending some extra money to constrain the choices of your gluttonous future self.
Similarly, some smokers buy cigarettes by the pack instead of the carton, paying a hefty premium to throttle their future consumption.
</p>
<p>
  The classic, prototypal example of self-binding is Odysseus tying himself to the mast of his ship so he could listen to the Sirens without getting lured onto the rocks.
Calling Homer&#8217;s Sirens addictive is an understatement since they kind of literally control your mind.
But there are a lot of things in modern society (hello, Internet) that are at least a little addictive and getting more so.

    endless stream of advice
  </a>
  about how to beat akrasia but I believe that most of it misses a very fundamental point that renders it nearly useless:
The myopic future self that thwarts your intentions is every bit as smart as your current, forward-looking self.
You can make lists and set rewards and break tasks into small chunks, or plan diets and buy treadmills and establish routines, but mostly your future self will see right through all the tricks and just won&#8217;t give a damn.
That version of yourself just wants to surf the web and/or eat pie. So that&#8217;s what you do, when the chips are down.
</p>
<p>
  The only way to be immune to future-you thumbing his or her nose at your current intentions is self-binding.
Which is to say that successful anti-akrasia tricks will involve commitment devices.
That&#8217;s because, by definition, a commitment device meaningfully constrains your recalcitrant future self&#8217;s actions.

  The commitment devices people actually use are mostly &#8212; with notable exceptions &#8212; band-aid solutions to akrasia.
</h4>
<p>
  What I find fascinating about that diverse list of commitment devices is the minuscule dent they put in the overall problem of akrasia.
The tricks people actually use are mostly band-aid solutions (see
  <a href=\\"#AUG\\">
    the list at the end of this article
  </a>
  for some interesting exceptions).
The problem is not with the concept of precommitment.
(Remember that akrasia is fundamentally a problem of your future self failing to follow through on your current intentions.)
The problem is failing to commit hard enough.
Take a goal like weighing twenty pounds less in a year.
Band-aid commitment devices are things like keeping junk food out of the house and joining a gym.
Why not get straight to the heart of the problem and make a contract with a friend that commits you to forfeiting a very painful sum of money if you don&#8217;t follow through on your weight-loss plan?
</p>
<h2>
  Beeminder
</h2>
<p>
  Well, here&#8217;s why not:  You&#8217;re a procrastinator.
You might spend the first ten months with your head in the sand and the last two months literally starving yourself, scrambling to meet the deadline.
With the goal a year in the future you have a new, recursive commitment problem: getting yourself to get started on the year-long commitment before the last minute.
So better than committing to the long-term goal directly is to commit to daily, inexorable progress towards it until you actually reach it.
That&#8217;s the fundamental idea behind Beeminder.
Continuing with weight loss as an example, here&#8217;s how it works:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Pick your goal weight and goal date.
  </li>
  <li>
    Let
    <a href=\\"http://beeminder.com\\">
      Beeminder
    </a>
    create a &#8220;Yellow Brick Road&#8221; for you to follow:
  </li>
  <img
    src=\\"http://beeminder.com/data/example.png\\"
    style=\\"vertical-align:middle\\"
    height=\\"303\\"
    alt=\\"beeminder example graph\\"
    width=\\"464\\"
  >
  <li>
    Place a large bet with a friend that you&#8217;ll stay on that Yellow Brick Road. If you go off (above) the road even for a single day you lose.
    <a
      class=\\"footnote\\"
      id=\\"ybr1\\"
      href=\\"#ybr\\"
    >
      [4]
    </a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Procrastinate like hell until you&#8217;re about to lose the bet.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  The change in focus from &#8220;weigh 20 pounds less next year&#8221; to &#8220;be on the yellow brick road tomorrow morning&#8221; makes all the difference.
If you&#8217;re in the wrong lane of your road today then it&#8217;s crunch time.
You have to be on your road tomorrow morning. Pull an all-nighter on the treadmill if that&#8217;s what it takes.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  Beeminder&#8217;s secret is to break down your long-term goal into day-to-day guidance &#8212; the Yellow Brick Road &#8212; and to force you to follow it.
</h4>
<p>
  In one sense that mentality&#8217;s crazy. Whatever you do in any single 24 hour period makes essentially no difference to your weight next year.
But that&#8217;s the kind of thinking that let you drift away from your ideal weight in the first place.
Beeminder&#8217;s tagline is &#8220;Bring Long-Term Consequences Near!&#8221;
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"stk1\\"
    href=\\"#stk\\"
  >
    [5]
  </a>
  Akrasia is the failure to adequately consider long-term consequences (like the health problems with remaining overweight) when there are immediate consequences pointing in the opposite direction (this pie is mind-bogglingly delicious!).
Beeminder&#8217;s secret is to use the Yellow Brick Road to automatically break down your long-term goal into day-to-day guidance.
And then, critically, add a commitment device so you can force yourself to stick to it, to force yourself to actually make that gradual but inexorable progress.
In other words, you transform the long-term consequences into near-term consequences (&#8220;I&#8217;ll forfeit this money if I&#8217;m not on the road in the morning!&#8221;).
</p>
<h2>
  Bright Lines
</h2>
<p>
  Many people who agree with the above in principle react viscerally to the idea of involving money.
I&#8217;m partial to money myself but I don&#8217;t claim it&#8217;s the only way.
Still, many obvious alternatives &#8212; like harnessing social disapproval &#8212; can fail if implemented naively.
To make the long-term consequences of failing at your goal immediate, you need a bright and painful line.
Using shame as a motivator with a public Yellow Brick Road doesn&#8217;t quite cut it because there&#8217;s minimal shame in having one datapoint slightly off your road &#8212; you&#8217;re still totally going to catch back up, right?
As you then gradually drift away from your road the shame grows only gradually as well.
You&#8217;re back in &#8220;one more day won&#8217;t matter&#8221; akrasia-addled fantasy land. I speak from experience.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  To make the long-term consequences of failing at your goal immediate, you need a bright and painful line.
</h4>
<p>
  Speaking of bright lines, the next most sticky sticking point with commitment contracts is probably a predilection for leniency and clemency.
Or you could call it weaseling when it comes from the self-binders themselves.
&#8220;Shouldn&#8217;t I still win if I get back on my Yellow Brick Road and end up reaching the final goal?&#8221; they (preemptively) whine.
Absolutely not. Recall Beeminder&#8217;s goal: bringing long-term consequences near.
In other words, the fact that you lose the game if you&#8217;re off the road today is by design.
To reprise the core akrasia problem, it&#8217;s very hard to, for example, forgo that piece of pie merely because it will make it harder to weigh 20 pounds less 10 months from now.
Please! One piece of pie won&#8217;t make the difference and there&#8217;s plenty of time to catch up!
Each individual piece of pie is
  <em>
    totally worth it
  </em>
  .
Same with each workout you really don&#8217;t feel like doing right at this moment.
Which of course is how you ended up 20 pounds overweight in the first place.
</p>
<p>
  With a Beeminder contract that whole dynamic changes: when you&#8217;re in the wrong lane of your road that one piece of pie could very well make the difference
  <em>
    tomorrow morning
  </em>
  and you&#8217;re acutely aware of it.
The consequences are immediate.
And of course even better is the flip side of that coin: if you are well into the right lane of your road (or below it) then it&#8217;s very nice to be able to enjoy your hard-earned safety buffer and eat that piece of pie guilt-free.

The ability to delay gratification at age four is highly predictive of future life success, and the key to success for the kids who could delay gratification was the use of tricks to distract themselves from the marshmallow staring at them.

    Although I&#8217;m using the multiple selves terminology, I view it as no more than a rhetorical device. There are not multiple selves in any real sense.
Rather, as I will argue, there&#8217;s in fact just one true you whose decision-making is sometimes distorted in the presence of immediate consequences, which act like a drug.
Which is to say (as an empirical fact) that when a decision involves some consequences that are immediate and some that are distant, humans irrationally (no amount of future discounting can account for it) over-weight the immediate consequences.
So I refer to multiple selves but I believe there is one true self: the one not under the influence of immediate consequences.

    You might object that this is far too harsh since daily weight fluctuates randomly and with menstrual cycles and whatnot.
Quite true, but
    <a href=\\"http://beeminder.com\\">
      Beeminder
    </a>
    tries to get the best of both worlds.
On the one hand, we want unbending rules about what it means to stay on track toward your goal, because that&#8217;s what&#8217;s motivating (no &#8220;I&#8217;ll catch up later&#8221; where you dig yourself in a hole).
On the other hand, you should never lose on a technicality.
Beeminder achieves this by auto-adjusting the width of the Yellow Brick Road to account for daily weight fluctuations.

    Alternatively: &#8220;Turn long-term commitments into daily commitments.&#8221;

      Christmas Club accounts [were] a staple of American banking in the 1970s.
The Christmas Club account was, on the surface, a bizarre idea: You gave the bank money every month.
The bank paid you no interest, and it would not let you take the money out until Dec 1. This was not much of a bargain. 
And yet Americans happily put their money into Christmas Club accounts, even though that same money in a savings account would have earned them interest.

    Before weight-loss surgery existed people would sometimes have their jaws wired shut to lose weight.
Either way, the mechanism is no more or less than making it physically difficult or physically painful to consume too many calories in a sitting.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have a crazy theory that the same effect could be achieved with a purely monetary commitment device.
Imagine putting $20,000 (my guess as to the cost of bariatric surgery) in escrow and having a
    <a href=\\"http://beeminder.com\\">
      Yellow Brick Road
    </a>
    to follow such that if you ever went off the road, even for just a day, the $20k would be gone.
If you ever got close to the edge of the road then you&#8217;d really be nervous. That piece of pie would not look so appetizing.
It could possibly be enough to put you over the edge, i.e., it might be a $20k piece of pie.
You &#8212; even that lazy, rapacious version of yourself &#8212; would probably genuinely not want to eat it, given the immediacy and severity of the consequences.
(I would love to test this theory if I could find a willing guinea pig!)

    No-drop prosecution is an option to press charges against an abusive spouse and stipulate that you don&#8217;t want to be allowed to drop them (the charges).
Actually I believe you don&#8217;t literally have the choice to stipulate that &#8212; you&#8217;re either in a no-drop jurisdiction or you&#8217;re not &#8212; but
    <a

      some economists have inferred
    </a>
    that many domestic violence victims would choose no-drop prosecution if they could.
In the case of an abusive relationship I could imagine strategic reasons for that (so you can&#8217;t, and your spouse knows you can&#8217;t, cave to threats to get you to drop charges) but the claim is that due to the sad psychology of domestic violence victims, it&#8217;s really about forcing your future self to follow through with what you know (when you sit back and reflect) is the right thing to do.

    The setup is that he let his students pick their project deadlines for the whole semester.
Once they&#8217;re picked they fail the course (they paid thousands for this course, we presume) if they don&#8217;t meet them.
So rationally they should choose all the deadlines to be on the last day, to maximize flexibility.
But it was clear to students that that was a terrible idea. And sure enough, the ones who precommitted to spaced-out deadlines did better.

  Want to hear my latest weirdo approach to diet?
Probably you do, out of morbid curiosity at least.
My goal in concocting this was to implement something a bit like intermittent fasting as a weight management strategy, and also to nudge my eating in a healthier direction.
Also I like alliteration.
</p>
<p>
  More to the point, I really thrive on bright lines.
This is absolutely not the optimally healthy diet, but it&#8217;s my attempt to solve my own optimization problem.
Namely, how to eat as much ice cream / cookies / curry as possible with minimal impact to my health! 
For many people it&#8217;s a no-brainer: health is way more important so eat dessert only if it&#8217;s someone&#8217;s birthday or something.
I don&#8217;t want to be that austere. 
So how far can I push it before health effects are non-negligible?
Any answers involving being reasonable about portion sizes or focusing on veggies or trying to have more balance or whatever are all waaaay too squishy for me.
I need it totally concrete.
</p>
<p>
  Before I describe the diet, a quick warning.
Everyone I&#8217;ve explained this to has been appalled and disgusted.

  I do appreciate the counterarguments, starting with the fact that diets never work.
I think that&#8217;s true in the sense that if you &#8220;go on a diet&#8221; to lose weight and then you stop the diet, you will gain all the weight back and more.
My answer is that you don&#8217;t ever stop.
If this isn&#8217;t something you can see doing for the rest of your life, don&#8217;t do it.
Which may make it sound all the more crazypants.
</p>
<p>
  I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s quite as weird as it sounds though.
It involves three or four days a week of restricting calories in various ways, with one day having strict rules to maximize healthiness, another day when I just try to be reasonable, and one day as a so-called cheat day.
</p>
<p>
  (Also it&#8217;s a bit similar to Ramadan, which, Happy Ramadan!)
</p>
<p>
  This is all in addition to beeminding my weight and my exercise, as well as beeminding being

  Starting with Mono-Meal Monday, apparently this is a common thing in the intermittent fasting (IF) community where they call it One Meal A Day (OMAD).
I&#8217;ve done enough intermittent fasting that just not eating any calories till dinner hardly fazes me.
In case of ambiguity about what counts as &#8220;a meal&#8221;, I use a one-hour calorie window. 
My first calorie of the day starts an hour countdown till my last calorie of the day.
(In case there&#8217;s
  <em>
    not
  </em>
  ambiguity, like eating at a restaurant where that&#8217;s definitely one meal regardless of how long it takes, I don&#8217;t worry about the countdown.)

  That brings us to Tumescent Tuesday.
Cheat days are commonly recommended by the diet industry, not that you should generally listen to the diet industry.
And maybe they&#8217;re mostly recommended when you&#8217;re being very strict the other six days of the week?
In any case, the concept makes sense to me.
Eating whatever the heck you feel like
  <em>
    sometimes
  </em>
  is nice.

    title=\\"Waste-Away Wednesday\\"
  >
  For Waste-Away Wednesdays I have zero calories starting from whenever I stop stuffing my face Tuesday night (midnight at the latest) until the next midnight at the earliest.
Mostly I consider it cheating to start eating Wednesday night, even if after midnight.
So this is typically a 36-hour fast.
</p>
<p>
  Themeless Thursdays are self-explanatory.

  Fitness Fridays, with only replacing calories you burn during exercise, are fairly similar to fasting.
You might wonder if Waste-Away Wednesdays should also have the exception that you can eat calories to replace whatever you may burn exercising.
I generally don&#8217;t because I seem to do fine exercising while fasting. 
But I seem to not be typical in that regard!
I do make compromises if I perceive a genuine health concern.
Like the time a Half Dome hike fell on a Wednesday and I dutifully fasted throughout the hike &#8212; which was fairly excruciating &#8212; but then decided it was prudent to eat dinner.
To keep myself from sliding down slippery slopes, I have the personal rule that I discuss and justify any deviations with other humans.

  Next, Salubrious Saturdays.
I originally named this &#8220;Strictly Salutary Sustenance Saturdays&#8221; and now I call it Salubriday for short.
The idea is to eat the healthiest possible diet, and anything you overindulge in on other days, disallow it altogether on Salubridays.
For me that&#8217;s 
(1) no simple carbs, which rules out any desserts, at least any that I&#8217;d want to eat, and any white starchy food like rice or pasta or potatoes, and 
(2) nothing with more saturated fat than olive oil, which rules out dairy and most meat and coconut oil.

  Finally, Social Sundays.
The idea of &#8220;only eat when eaten to&#8221; (Bee&#8217;s coinage) was something we came up with for not gaining weight on family vacations.
It means no constraints for social eating but any time there isn&#8217;t social eating you just fast.
I realize that for many people this would ruin a vacation.
For me it absolutely maximizes my vacational utility by minimizing time spent on something non-integral to the vacation.
I am very weird, as the entire concept of themed eating days must have already made abundantly clear.

<p>
  Ok, let me take some questions before you explode with indignation.
</p>
<h4>
  Don&#8217;t cheat days defeat the whole thing?
</h4>
<p>
  They could if you &#8220;cheat&#8221; hard enough.
Like eating so much on Tumescent Tuesday that despite following that with Waste-Away Wednesday, you&#8217;ve eaten more over those two days than you would&#8217;ve normally.
But I don&#8217;t think I manage to do that even if I try.
You can certainly undo a lot of the fasting via the cheat windows.
Still, it&#8217;s better than nothing.
And I can always tighten down the rules, add more rules, or add more Beeminder goals if the cheat windows are too big.
I do like the cheat windows.
I&#8217;d nix them if necessary but it&#8217;s not been necessary.
</p>
<h4>
  Is this compatible with a social life?
</h4>
<p>
  You&#8217;re asking the wrong person? 
No, I think it is. 
I allow for swapping days
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"SWAP1\\"
    href=\\"#SWAP\\"
  >
    [3]
  </a>
  , or making other adjustments as long as I discuss them with my family. 
With three days per week (Tumescent Tuesday, Themeless Thursday, and Social Sunday) that are definitionally fully compatible with all social plans, this seems to be a non-issue. 
Even Mono-Meal Monday and Fitness Friday wouldn&#8217;t typically be incompatible with social plans. 
So mainly it&#8217;s Waste-Away Wednesday and Salubriday that are socially constraining.
But again, just swap the days around.
If you have a dinner party on Saturday, swap Salubriday with Social Sunday.
</p>
<h4>
  For Social Sunday / only-eat-when-eaten-to, can you invite other people to dinner? What about grazing at a buffet table?
</h4>
<p>
  If inviting people to dinner has social value then I figure themed eating shouldn&#8217;t impinge on that.
As long as I do it because it&#8217;s what&#8217;s socially optimal, not as an excuse to eat, I consider it kosher for Social Sunday.
</p>
<p>
  As for grazing, ideally only-eat-when-eaten-to means I think of myself as a robot who has no interest in food but also I emulate a human and so will eat whenever it would be weird not to.
Which would preclude grazing.
In practice I do a bad job of that because I totally do jump on the social excuse to graze at a buffet table and am liable to abuse the crap out of that loophole and stuff myself. 
But arguably that&#8217;s still ok overall.
After all, other times I&#8217;m fasting.
</p>
<p>
  So my current rule is that I can go crazy on Social Sundays with any eating that it&#8217;s fair to classify as social.
But mostly it would feel like cheating to be the one to suggest it.
</p>
<h4>
  Doesn&#8217;t fasting lead to binging?
</h4>
<p>
  This is a good warning. 
Mostly I defer to the endless resources on
  <a
    href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermittent_fasting\\"
    title=\\"I feel markedly less crazy recommending IF with it having a Wikipedia page. It doesn&#39;t even have an elaborate Criticism section.\\"
  >
    Intermittent Fasting
  </a>
  here. 
Personally, I may overeat after fasting but it&#8217;s net-positive for me.
</p>
<p>
  My general take on Intermittent Fasting is that it&#8217;s generally healthy and helpful for not gaining weight and has no real downsides other than the ones that will be obvious if you just try it. 
So if it doesn&#8217;t make you hangry or binge on junk food when the fasts are over or anything &#8212; and you don&#8217;t have a medical reason not to &#8212; you should totally do it. 
(Which is not to say it&#8217;s the most important thing you can do or that you should do only that.)
</p>
<h4>
  What about just, y&#8217;know, having a healthy relationship with food? Like Themeless Thursday every day.
</h4>
<p>
  Oh, yes, this is extremely correct.
If you do Themeless Thursdays every day and you&#8217;re happy with your shape, then, actually I&#8217;m confused as to why you&#8217;ve read this far.
The impetus for all this for me is to eat less and eat healthier.
This system induces me to do that.
</p>
<p>
  I see how bizarre this all must sound if you don&#8217;t have the problem this aims to solve.
But I think &#8220;just have a healthy relationship with food&#8221; is about as helpful as &#8220;just don&#8217;t procrastinate&#8221;.
There&#8217;s no silver bullet, there&#8217;s just elaborate incentive engineering.
</p>
<p>
  If you do have a silver bullet, or even some less-precious-metal bullet, by all means, do let me know.
I&#8217;m probably game to try it!
</p>
<h4>
  Rather than all this nonsense, can you identify the root causes? I.e., why, for the love of God, why?
</h4>
<p>
  Asking why I need this to maintain my weight seems like asking why I need a speedometer in my car to keep from speeding.
I grant that some people have a nice intuitive feel for safe speeds and don&#8217;t need speedometers. 
Others need strict rules and bright lines. 
&#8220;This is the speed limit &#8212; just stay under it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
  But to answer more directly about root causes, it&#8217;s that if I eat whatever I feel like then my weight goes up. 
I haven&#8217;t tested how far it would go but it&#8217;s wholly unambiguous that it would go arbitrarily far.
</p>
<p>
  It&#8217;s possible that there&#8217;s a more fundamental root cause, like my hunger mechanism is broken due to nutrient deficiencies.
Perhaps with a set of do-more goals on Beeminder for vegetables and other healthy food, I would find that I could trust my gut, so to speak, about whatever else to eat.
</p>
<p>
  If that has worked for you, I&#8217;d love to hear about it!

  I better include a footnote about how disordered this sounds.
I gather that even without being underweight or vomiting or anything else manifestly physically unhealthy, it&#8217;s possible to do psychological self-harm via eating habits.
I don&#8217;t personally relate to that and there&#8217;s no ambiguity that for me personally, the risk of becoming overweight is greater.
But! 
The fact that I don&#8217;t understand and don&#8217;t relate suggests some general caution.
Consult your doctor, etc. 
And don&#8217;t listen to crazy diet advice on the internet, least of all mine.

<p>
  From my own perspective it&#8217;s exceedingly clear that I don&#8217;t have any kind of food-related mental illness but 
WHAT IF THAT&#8217;S EXACTLY WHAT THE MENTAL ILLNESS MAKES ME THINK?
</p>
<p>
  (I really honestly assign negligible probability to me having a mental disorder that is making me assign negligible probability to itself but on sheer principle I have committed to using some trusted friends&#8217; assessment of such instead of my own. 
Fortunately they agree with my assessment. Sweat-smile-emoji!)

  &#8220;Just allow swapping&#8221; seemed simple enough.
But then&#8230;
One weekend we had people over on Saturday so I swapped Salubrious Saturday with Social Sunday.
So far so good.
Then on Sunday we did a bike (skeddle) tour and THEY HAD A CHOCOLATE FOUNTAIN AT THE FINISH LINE.
So I was like &#8220;I&#8217;ll just swap today&#8217;s Salubriday with Tumescent Tuesday&#8221;.
But that&#8217;s swapping an already swapped day which sounds like a pretty slippery slope.
So Faire and Bee and I worked out a reasonably principled system that allows arguably as much swapping around as possible without letting the system fall apart.
It was surprisingly confusing! 
At one point we had something that seemed workable and then Faire demonstrated how it allowed for having Tumescent Tuesdays all week long. 
(That is an extremely sharp kid.)
Here&#8217;s what we finally came up with:
</p>
<p>
  First, being &#8220;caught up&#8221; means that I&#8217;ve done the exact correct number of 
Mono-Meal Mondays, 
Tumescent Tuesdays, 
Waste-Away Wednesdays, 
Themeless Thursdays, 
Fitness Fridays, 
Salubridays, and 
Social Sundays. 
I may have swapped things around but all such swaps are in the past. 
Everything adds up and the books are balanced.
</p>
<p>
  The main rule is that any time I&#8217;m caught up, I can permute the upcoming 7 days any way I want.
I can keep swapping around within those 7 days but never beyond 7 days from when I was last caught up.
</p>
<p>
  For example, say I&#8217;m fully caught up as of Tuesday night and now it&#8217;s Wednesday and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I would rather have another Tumescent Tuesday&#8221;. 
No problem! 
Tuesday is 6 days away so I can swap it and have a Tumescent Wednesday. 
Then I have a Themeless Thursday and a Fitness Friday and then on Saturday I&#8217;m like, &#8220;salubriousness is no fun; let&#8217;s have a social eating day&#8221;. 
Still no problem! 
I&#8217;m still swapping things within the 7 days from when I was last caught up. 
So I have Social Saturday and Salubrious Sunday, then Mono-Meal Monday. 
Now it&#8217;s the last day, Tuesday, but I already did my tumescent day so there&#8217;s no choice but to use the only theme left, so Waste-Away Tuesday it is.
At that point all the swaps are complete and I&#8217;m caught up again.
</p>
<p>
  Of course now it&#8217;s Wednesday and I&#8217;m supposed to fast for what will now be two days in a row. 
So probably it wasn&#8217;t a good idea to borrow the next Tumescent Tuesday the day after just having had a Tumescent Tuesday!
</p>
<p>
  So in theory I could back myself into corners but in practice I haven&#8217;t.
A stricter and simpler version would be that the week always starts on Monday and swapping can only happen within a standard Monday-through-Sunday week. 
If it&#8217;s Sunday I never have any flexibility &#8212; that&#8217;s the last day of the week so no more swapping.

      First, this guest post is an absolute inspiration and we implore you to read it.
We&#8217;ve talked about Brent Yorgey before in press roundups but we&#8217;ll assume you don&#8217;t read those and repeat our gushing in this introduction.
If you don&#8217;t know him, Professor Yorgey is well-known in the

He&#8217;s also written some amazing posts about Beeminder on his own blog, starting with one in 2013 in which he said that Beeminder had

That was 6 months after discovering Beeminder and we didn&#8217;t know if he was just in the honeymoon phase.
Well, he followed up in 2016 with

proving that &#8220;life-changing&#8221; was no exaggeration. 
He credited Beeminder with 
completing his PhD, 
becoming a fancypants professor, 
maintaining two blogs, 
learning ancient Hebrew, 
and
losing 15 pounds
(and, for good measure, coming within a factor of 2 of the world record for the 500m swim).
It makes us glow with pride to have created a tool that people like Brent can put to such powerful use and have that kind of positive impact on the world.
Ok, gushing done.
Now listen to the professor.

<p>
  Despite what you might think after that introduction, this blog post is not the confession of a 
Beemindaholic
about to burn out. 
Nor is it the boast of an ultradisciplined, unsleeping superachiever who does nothing but work.
I&#8217;m a recovering akratic, a husband, a dad, a teacher, and an academic.
Having so many goals is not for everyone, but I&#8217;ve found ways to make it work very well for me.
I want to tell you a bit about how I got here, how I manage it, and why you might consider doing something similar (or not!).
</p>
<h2>
  My story
</h2>
<p>
  I&#8217;ve been beeminding since September 2012 (five and a half years).
A lot of goals have come and gone in that time, and my approach to beeminding has changed quite a bit, as has my life.
In September 2012 I was a graduate student living in Philadelphia with my wife and one-year-old son.
Since then I 
finished my PhD, 
completed two job searches, 
moved three times and lived in three different states, 
published three papers, 
bought a house, 
taught almost 20 classes, and
had another child.
Looking through the history of my Beeminder goals would probably tell you a lot about my life over those years and the things that have been important to me at various times.
</p>
<p>
  Every time I realize there is something that I
  <a

    want
  </a>
  to do, and could do, but don&#8217;t currently do &#8212; no matter how big or small! &#8212; I make a Beeminder goal for it.
Is there a paper I need to review by a certain date?
I make a Beeminder goal for number of pages carefully read and commented on.
I want to spend more time doing

I made a Beeminder goal for that.

  ly, visits to the dentist are now a breeze.) 
My Beeminder goals aren&#8217;t just a miscellaneous add-on; they pretty much delineate the whole shape of my life.
</p>
<p>
  This style of Beeminding &#8212; let&#8217;s call it Whole-Life Beeminding, aka
  <em>
    Making Goals for All The Things
  </em>
  &#8212; can be a really effective way to shape the life you want to live.
  <strong>
    But
  </strong>
  as all too many people have learned the

    title=\\"Beeminder blog post about beating Beeminder burnout\\"
  >
    hard way
  </a>
  , 
it can also be a recipe for hubris-fueled disaster.
Here are some of the lessons I&#8217;ve learned on how to do this safely and effectively.
</p>
<h2>
  Start small
</h2>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;Let&#8217;s call it Whole-Life Beeminding&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  This is pretty standard advice, but worth repeating: 
new goals should start with a very shallow slope that is stupidly easy to achieve, or with a slope that is so egregiously lenient that the goal basically exists only to gather data.
After some experience and success you can of course start ratcheting up the difficulty.
But without that initial experience, it is notoriously hard to estimate what is actually reasonable and achievable for you 
(even when taking this fact into account; this is a corollary of
  <a
    href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstadter%27s_law\\"
    title=\\"Hofstadter&#39;s Law: Things always take longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter&#39;s Law\\"
  >
    Hofstadter&#8217;s Law
  </a>
  ).
For example, inspired by
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/bites/\\"
    title=\\"Beeminder blog post about beeminding the number of bites of food you take\\"
  >
    Braden Shepherdson&#8217;s recent blog post
  </a>
  , 
I added a
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/byorgey/bites\\"
    title=\\"Brent&#39;s Beeminder goal for bites\\"
  >
    goal to count how many bites I take
  </a>
  .
But I first created it with a generous slope of 200 bites per day, just in order to gather data on how many bites I actually take, and to get used to the habit of entering data.
It turns out that 200 bites wasn&#8217;t even
  <em>
    quite
  </em>
  as generous as I thought &#8212; my average was something like 130 bites, which is higher than I would have guessed.
(On one day including a very large lunch followed by a church potluck in the evening with a giant buffet and 10 different desserts (for which I went back for seconds) I took a total of 170 bites!) 
After a few weeks I had a much better sense of how many bites I take for a given meal, what a good day looks like, what a bad day looks like, and what a reasonable, achievable goal would be.
(My current goal is 110 bites per day, if you are curious.
Why was my average so much higher than
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/bites/\\"
    title=\\"Beeminder blog post about beeminding the number of bites of food you take\\"
  >
    Braden&#8217;s
  </a>
  ?
I don&#8217;t know.
But that&#8217;s the point of starting by just collecting data!)
</p>
<h2>
  Give goals time to &#8220;wear in&#8221;
</h2>
<p>
  You really shouldn&#8217;t create more than one or two goals at once,
  <em>
    even if
  </em>
  they are really easy goals and
  <em>
    even if
  </em>
  you are absolutely, positively, 100% sure you can handle it.
</p>
<p>
  One reason for this advice is obvious: it&#8217;s easy to underestimate how much time or effort new goals will require, and consequently burn out trying to keep up with them.
This is related to the advice to start small.
</p>
<p>
  But there is another, less obvious reason for this advice.
Imagine what would happen if you instantly went from having zero goals to having 50
  <em>
    super easy
  </em>
  goals.
Even if the total amount of time and effort necessary to achieve all the goals were well within your grasp, you would probably still go crazy and burn out, because you would spend so much mental energy trying to keep up with all of them and figure out what you should be doing next.
I find that each new goal takes a few weeks to wear in to the patterns of my life.
I start to figure out where the goal fits, where and when I will pay attention to it, which other goals I might &#8220;bundle&#8221; it with, whether it makes more sense to do a little every day or only occasionally in big chunks, and so on.
By the time I get around to adding a new goal, the old goals have become more habitual, so I can focus more of my energy on figuring out how to achieve the new.
</p>
<h2>
  Don&#8217;t get rid of easy goals
</h2>
<p>
  My
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/byorgey/floss\\"
    title=\\"Brent&#39;s Beeminder goal for flossing\\"
  >
    flossing goal
  </a>
  is a good example.
You can see that I started this goal in late 2013, with the aim to floss 6.5 times per week on average.
At first I was often in the blue, but by the second half of 2014 I was almost always in the green.
By the middle of 2015, I had built up such a large safety buffer (6 or 7 days, if I recall correctly) that I decided I just didn&#8217;t need the Beeminder goal any more, so I archived it.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;My Beeminder goals pretty much delineate the whole shape of my life&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  It turns out that this was a mistake.
The graph doesn&#8217;t show it, of course, but over the course of 2016 I started flossing less and less;
by the middle of 2017, when I restarted the goal, I was probably only flossing once every two weeks!
It turns out that even though there is absolutely zero chance I will ever derail on this goal, it is still valuable to me: 
the simple fact of having the goal and entering data provides the nudge needed to get me over the teeny tiny hump of deciding to floss.
Without the goal, it was simply too easy to decide in the moment that I didn&#8217;t need to floss today.
</p>
<p>
  And you know what? 
There&#8217;s nothing wrong with having a bunch of easy goals!
When I wake up in the morning I might have nine or ten beemergencies, but I just start knocking them off one by one and it feels GREAT.
By the time I get to more difficult goals I am already in an accomplished and productive mood.
</p>
<p>
  So I simply don&#8217;t get rid of goals anymore, even easy ones that I think I don&#8217;t need, unless they are truly done.
</p>
<h2>
  Other miscellaneous advice
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Use autodata integrations whenever possible.
Quite a few of my goals collect data automatically, primarily via
      <a
        href=\\"http://tagtime.com\\"
        title=\\"Stochastic time-tracking for space cadets\\"
      >
        TagTime
      </a>
      and
      <a
        href=\\"http://ifthismindthat.com\\"
        title=\\"Beeminder&#39;s integration page for If This Then That\\"
      >
        IFTTT
      </a>
      .
I personally find autodata to be especially important for do-less goals.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      For the remaining manual-entry goals, use a good interface.
I make heavy use of the Android app and its timer and tally entry features;
since I am a nerd I also use
      <a
        href=\\"https://github.com/mbork/beeminder.el\\"
        title=\\"Mmmm... nerdery...\\"
      >
        mbork&#8217;s Beeminder client for emacs org-mode
      </a>
      , 
especially at work.
The Beeminder website is nice but it&#8217;s not really optimized for dealing with lots of goals.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <a
        href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/whattomind\\"
        title=\\"Old Beeminder blog post with similar advice about what metrics to beemind\\"
      >
        Track
      </a>
      inputs, not outputs!
This is especially important when you have a lot of goals, since when you are staring down multiple beemergencies you really need to have concrete, manageable things you can Actually Do (tm) to dispatch them.
Goals that track indirect outputs tend to require more foresight: for example, by the time you are in the red on your weight goal it is probably already too late; to stay on track you have to be thinking several days ahead and figuring out what actions are likely to lead to your desired weight.
With 50 goals I don&#8217;t have time for that kind of advance introspection. 
I just want to have concrete actions I can do
      <em>
        now
      </em>
      ,
      <em>
        today
      </em>
      to make progress on the goals that need attention.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  In a forthcoming post I will actually take you on a tour of my 50 goals, to see how I put all of this into practice!

  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  [UPDATED with actual times.]
And on the final session Sunday we might even get Cantor Soule-Reeves (our eight-year-old) to give a short show&amp;tell talk (yes, that&#8217;s what they call them even if you&#8217;re not 8) about how his step data correlates with the weather.

When doing a live demo of beeminding, Bethany dropped to the floor to do a push up before recording it because &#8220;the data must be pure&#8221;. 
I was immediately charmed. 
With a degree in economics and more than my fair share of time dealing with messy data sets, I have a healthy respect for those who keep data pure.

  I have a good 20 years of data nerdery under my belt.
One of my earliest memories is conducting a detailed census of all my stuffed animals &#8212; annually. 
They were all assigned jobs and salaries (5 peanuts/year for Snuffy the elephant, 25 bamboo/year for Baby the panda). 
Besides pointing to my future as an economics scholar,

Since 2008, I’ve been logging stacks of data about myself and publishing it into a zine each year.

  So how will I be helping out now that I&#8217;m on the Bee Team?
</h3>
<p>
  Well, I’ll be the person to talk to if you’re:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    interested in covering Beeminder in a news article
  </li>
  <li>
    want Beeminder to advertise on your service/blog
  </li>
  <li>
    looking to discuss sponsorship
  </li>
  <li>
    generally want to talk about ways to spread the word about how Beeminder is the bees&#8217; knees.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  I&#8217;ll also likely be covering some operational stuff behind-the-scenes, since I&#8217;m the kind of person who gets giddy when the words &#8220;tax planning&#8221; and &#8220;double-entry bookkeeping&#8221; come up. And if I&#8217;m lucky, I&#8217;ll be the puppetmaster behind a new referral program &#8212; hopefully with some inventive and appropriately bee-like perks for telling your friends about Beeminder.
</p>
<p>
  I’m stoked to help out as Minister of the Exterior (less fabulously referred to as Digital Director) because there’s not a more dream position in the world than being a chief ambassador for the life-changing magic of Beeminder.

  &#8220;StickK&#8217;s anti-charities seem the most egregious, actively harming the world.&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  Take my thoughts on this with a huge grain of salt, given my conflict of interest, but I really dislike commitment devices that destroy things &#8212; either information or other forms of value. 
StickK&#8217;s anti-charities
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"BCH1\\"
    href=\\"#BCH\\"

    [2]
  </a>
  seem the most egregious, actively harming the world. 
I&#8217;m certainly motivated to not allow the world to become a worse place, so it&#8217;s not that it would be ineffective as a commitment contract. 
Just that I&#8217;m also motivated to prevent things that
  <em>
    don&#8217;t
  </em>
  make the world worse in any way, like paying money to a third party (who&#8217;s not evil).
</p>
<p>
  At the other extreme, I&#8217;m skeptical of commitment contracts where the beneficiary is a (good) charity because what kind of jerk is motivated to not give to charity? 
If you set an amount that you really can&#8217;t afford then that can work. 
Unfortunately no one seems to ever have the guts to do that.
</p>
<p>
  So, yes, this is all an elaborate rationalization for Beeminder getting all the money! 
I&#8217;m serious though, I think the economics / psychology / behavioral economics are sound. 
Commitment contracts should be socially efficient and deleting even files on your own computer isn&#8217;t!
</p>
<p>
  In fact, if you set up a commitment device where you destroyed your computer if you didn&#8217;t stay on your yellow brick road then I actually would call that kind of immoral, even though it was your own computer. 
Because you could&#8217;ve instead given it away and not wasted anything. 
Burning money, in contrast, doesn&#8217;t waste anything (except some paper).

  So I&#8217;m fine with the hypothetical

    money-shredding alarm clock

  , even though no one would ever actually use one of those. 
(There are some
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/competitors\\">
    clever phone apps
  </a>
  that make you jump through various hoops to make the alarm turn off that might be useful though.) 
And I guess, if I&#8217;m to be true to my principles, Aherk is fine too, from a social efficiency point of view, as long as your friends would get amusement out of your embarrassing photos commensurate with your own embarrassment.
</p>
<p>
  The whole point of a commitment device is to set up an automatic potential penalty that punishes you in some way.
Just make sure that the amount of harm caused to yourself is counterbalanced by a greater or equal amount of benefit to someone else, leaving the world no worse than you found it!

  UPDATE: I&#8217;m adding this footnote in 2020 because no one understands what I mean when I say &#8220;literally burning money isn&#8217;t wasteful&#8221;.
It&#8217;s admittedly confusing. 
&#8220;Burning money&#8221; is used idiomatically to mean being maximally wasteful and destroying real value.
But imagine you do a bunch of work for me and I pay you by writing down IOUs on pieces of paper and then the next day you set fire to those pieces of paper.
My reaction would be &#8220;gosh, thank you for obliterating my debt!&#8221;.
Burning government currency feels intuitively different but it&#8217;s really truly not.
It&#8217;s very weird and ironic for the government to object to people burning their IOUs.
</p>
<p>
  I know half of you are still looking at me like I&#8217;m hovering upside down and speaking backwards, so here&#8217;s another way to look at it.
The money issuer (the government or the fed or whatever) fully accounts for money getting lost or accidentally destroyed and they just print more to keep the total physical money supply at the right level.
Not only is that very little skin off their nose &#8212; they can spend pennies printing stacks of hundred dollar bills &#8212; but they can then actually spend those bills!
(Or sell them to banks at face value, whatever.)
Burning money is fundamentally the same as sending it to the government.
The actual waste &#8212; from a society-wide perspective &#8212; of literally burning money is just the quite low cost of replacing it.
</p>
<p>
  And I know some fraction of you now think I&#8217;ve outlined a brazen free money conspiracy but that&#8217;s a debate for elsewhere.
How damaging, or how illegal, money-burning is is quite irrelevant to the point of this post, which is that a threat of destroying value or otherwise harming the world as a commitment device is bad and unnecessary.

  Today I would like to pick a fight with WordPress.
I&#8217;m still a huge fan of the company (Automattic).
They&#8217;ve done a lot for us over the years and I have good friends who work there.
But blog posts work better as beefs so forget all that.
</p>
<p>
  Let&#8217;s talk about what a wrongy-wrongpants WordPress is with their aggressively over-clever canonical redirects feature!
Say you write a post with URL &#8220;blog.bmndr.co/datasmithing&#8221; on your wordpress blog.
If someone then tries to surf to &#8220;blog.bmndr.co/data&#8221; WordPress thinks to itself, 
&#8220;Aha, I know what this user meant to do! There&#8217;s only one URL on this blog that starts with &#8216;data&#8217; so we can just silently redirect to it and the user will be so pleased!&#8221;
Maybe whoever came up with that was misguidedly trying to adhere to the
  <a
    href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment\\"
    title=\\"AKA least surprise. See later links to posts on the Beeminder blog about how bad this is!\\"
  >
    Principle of Least Astonishment
  </a>
  or

    title=\\"AKA DWIM. See later links to posts on the Beeminder blog about how bad this is!\\"
  >
    Do What I Mean
  </a>
  .
</p>
<p>
  And what&#8217;s so bad about that, you ask?
If the user just forgot the final &#8220;g&#8221; in &#8220;datasmithing&#8221; is it somehow helping them to pedantically point out that they typoed the URL?
</p>
<p>
  (Actually WordPress is even more egregiously magical.
If you typo a URL in some other way, like transposing two characters, it just silently sends you to the front page of the blog.)
</p>
<p>
  My answer is yes!
Always be maximally pedantic!
We have two other whole other blog posts about why that&#8217;s important in general &#8212;

  >
    The Anti-Magic Principle
  </a>
  &#8212; but in this case there&#8217;s a very specific reason.
Suppose we later actually write a new blog post with the URL &#8220;blog.bmndr.co/data&#8221;.
WordPress will just silently break the old link that had been reliably pointing to the &#8220;datasmithing&#8221; one!

  Facepalm!
</p>
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<p>
  Ok, my rant is over.
Now let me show off the nifty thing the Beeminder blog does instead, now that we&#8217;ve
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/blogmorphosis\\"
    title=\\"If you forget that URL, clever as it is, try surfing to blog.beeminder.com/blog and see what happens!\\"
  >
    moved off of WordPress
  </a>
  .
It might only be useful for me personally but since I know the URLs of our 13 years (!) of blog posts mostly by heart
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"HEART1\\"
    href=\\"#HEART\\"
  >
    [2]
  </a>
  and mostly type them from memory when linking to them, I&#8217;m pretty enamored with how
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/astroblog\\"
    title=\\"Nathan Arthur&#39;s post with all the gory details of our blog migration\\"
  >
    narthur and I implemented
  </a>
  the blog&#8217;s 404 pages.
To show this off with an example, it&#8217;s hard to remember that the URL for our classic post on why we hate anti-charities is &#8220;/anticharity&#8221; but the Anti-Magic Principle post is &#8220;/magic&#8221;. 
So now check out what happens if you mix those up:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a
      href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/charity\\"
      title=\\"Yes, this intentionally 404s -- the point is to look at the suggested link on the 404 page\\"
    >
      blog.beeminder.com/charity
    </a>
  </li>

    <a
      href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/antimagic\\"
      title=\\"Yes, this intentionally 404s -- the point is to look at the suggested link on the 404 page\\"
    >
      blog.beeminder.com/antimagic
    </a>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  If you&#8217;re too lazy to click those, you&#8217;ll see something like this, for the example of trying to surf to &#8220;blog.beeminder.com/blog&#8221;:
</p>
<p>

    class=\\"aligncenter\\"

  >
</p>
<p>
  I think this is within epsilon of the best of all worlds.
At worst it&#8217;s an extra click for the case that you happened to type a strict prefix of an existing URL &#8212; no magic redirection.
But since we&#8217;re now being nice and transparent about what happened &#8212; you&#8217;re getting a 404 error &#8212; we&#8217;re free to insert as much magic as we like into the list of suggestions, since the user can simply take or leave them.
And we do!
We throw in everything which has the mistyped URL as a strict prefix, as well anything that has it as a strict suffix.
And if there aren&#8217;t any of those we get fancy and look for the URL with the closest Levenshtein distance.
Here&#8217;s another screenshot, showing the hovertext helpfully explaining itself:
</p>
<p>
  <img
    class=\\"aligncenter\\"
    alt=\\"Another screenshot of our 404 page suggesting posts that are a close match to 'eggo'\\"

Maybe! But clearly the blog is a labor of love and this makes me happy.

  We&#8217;re delighted to announce that the
  <a
    href=\\"http://beeminder.com/api\\"
    title=\\"The full documentation for the API\\"
  >
    Beeminder API
  </a>
  is now open to the public!
Before you dive into the full documentation, let&#8217;s start with a taste of this beeliciousness.
First, grab your personal auth token from
  <a href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/api/v1/auth_token.json\\">
    beeminder.com/api/v1/auth_token.json
  </a>
  .
Let&#8217;s pretend it&#8217;s TOOLEGIT.
You can now add a data point to your graph from the command line like so:
</p>
<code>
  curl --data 'auth_token=TOOLEGIT&amp;timestamp=1346774400&amp;value=1&amp;comment=api+test' https://www.beeminder.com/api/v1/users/meta/goals/uvi/datapoints.json
</code>
<p>
  Programmatic adding of data points is the biggie but the API supports most of everything else you can do from the website.

  In fact, our soon-to-be-announced Android and iPhone apps use our API.
(UPDATE:
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/apps\\">
    Android/iPhone announcement
  </a>
  .)
For that kind of fanciness, we support oauth as well as the dirt simple personal auth tokens like in the above example.

  The Beeminder iOS app just got a long-overdue update, and it includes two sorta-huge new features!
</p>
<h2>
  Apple Health integration
</h2>
<p>
  The first big feature is that you can now sync your data from the Apple Health app to a Beeminder goal. 
To set it up, first create the new goal (you&#8217;ll either want Do More or Weight Loss). 
You can do this from the app &#8212; it will open mobile Safari, so there will be a lot of pinching and zooming for now
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"MOB1\\"
    href=\\"#MOB\\"
  >
    [1]
  </a>
  , or on the desktop website.
Once you have your goal created, tap the settings gear from the main screen of the app.
You&#8217;ll now see a line for &#8220;Health App integration&#8221;. 
Tap the goal you just created, and then the metric you want to track. 
After the goal is paired, it should fetch the last 7 days of data from the Health app and add those datapoints.
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"DUP1\\"
    href=\\"#DUP\\"
  >
    [2]
  </a>
  You may want to adjust your road to match the slope after they&#8217;ve been imported.
</p>
<p>
  The app is designed to update the goal in the background as you&#8217;re walking around doing your activities, but there are a couple caveats.
The first is that the update can only occur if the phone is unlocked.
So if you do a bunch of steps with your phone in your pocket, but don&#8217;t open it before you go to bed, you won&#8217;t see those steps until you unlock your phone the next day.
That&#8217;s normally fine &#8212; the app actually updates the last seven days of data each time it syncs, in order to not lose data from previous days.
And if you have a beemergency then Beeminder will be hounding you so you&#8217;ll know to unlock your phone to let the latest data through.
</p>
<p>
  The second caveat is that sometimes the background update isn&#8217;t as real-time as you might like.
You do some steps, check your Beeminder goal, and no new data.
But it seems like you really have to be watching closely to have this happen.
And you can always force a fetch of the latest data just by opening the Beeminder app.
</p>
<p>
  So it&#8217;s probably OK if you&#8217;re skimming this post and missed both of those caveats.

  In a scientific poll conducted last week, 100% of the people sitting in the chair next to mine had no idea what a Today widget even was. 
Hence the educational blog post!
If you swipe right from the home screen, iOS shows a number of widgets, each associated with an app on your phone. 
At the bottom there&#8217;s a button called &#8220;Edit&#8221; that shows all the widgets available to you from apps you&#8217;ve installed. 
If you add the Beeminder widget, it will show you your most urgent goals each day, along with how much you have to do in order to stay on track for them.
</p>
<p>
  As of this update, you can also add data directly from the widget, as long as the data you&#8217;re adding is an integer 
(keyboard input isn&#8217;t allowed by iOS in the widgets, but you can tap the stepper to update the value).
Super handy for binary goals where the input is always a &#8220;1&#8221; to indicate you did the thing that day.
</p>
<h2>
  GTBee
</h2>
<p>
  You may remember GTBee from such blog posts as 
&#8220;
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/gtbee/\\"
    title=\\"The name GTBee will only make sense if you&#39;re a big enough connoisseur productivity porn to know about David Allen&#39;s GTD system\\"
  >
    Get Things Done (Or Else!) With Beeminder and GTBee
  </a>
  &#8221;.
It also got an even-longer-overdue update recently, and now lets you choose any starting amount of money you want to put at risk.
So if you want to charge yourself $1,000 if you don&#8217;t finish your thesis, GTBee can help you out with that. 
There&#8217;s a few other improvments as well, such as a UI that fits all screen sizes (did I mention this update was long overdue?).
</p>
<p>
  To be clear, GTBee is a totally separate iOS app that&#8217;s meant to be a dirt simple alternative to Beeminder.
It&#8217;s just a to-do list app that will automatically charge you (it assumes you have a Beeminder account for this) for not getting things done by your chosen deadlines.
</p>
<p>
  <br>
  &nbsp;
  <br>
</p>
<p>
  In conclusion, shiny new app updates for iPhone people!
Widgets with quick data entry, slightly slicker and more flexible GTBee, and most importantly, so many metrics to automatically beemind, thanks to Apple Health.
In fact, here&#8217;s the whole list, which we&#8217;ll update as we add more (suggestions solicited!):

  We&#8217;re excited to announce that starting today, you can stay on top of your Beeminder goals wherever you are. 
We&#8217;ve just released Beeminder apps for both iPhone and Android.
Get them here:

<p>
  Here&#8217;s what these apps let you do:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Create new goals
  </li>
  <li>
    Add data points
  </li>

  </li>
  <li>
    See goal details and graphs
  </li>
  <li>
    Create new Beeminder accounts
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The Android app also has a few additional features:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Home screen widgets to track goal progress
  </li>
  <li>
    Notifications when you&#8217;re about to derail
  </li>
  <li>
    Full data point history (no editing of historical data within the app yet)
  </li>
  <li>
    Support for multiple existing Beeminder accounts
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Both the apps have been months in the making and have been vastly improved thanks to our vigilant beta testers.

  </a>
  to thank for the Android app. 
Danny and Uluç were roommates in grad school, and worked together in the
  <a href=\\"http://www.eecs.umich.edu/ai/\\">
    Michigan Artificial Intelligence Lab
  </a>
  building killer robots, or whatever they do there. 
So it wasn&#8217;t hard to convince Uluç to get back to his coding/hacking days and actually deliver some code,
  <a href=\\"http://beeminder.com/saranli/beeminder\\">
    eventually spending about 300 hours
  </a>
  on the app, and finally learning Java in the meantime. 
His favorite feature of the Android app would have to be a tie between the notifications (simpler

and the home screen widgets that get in your face like Rocky Balboa&#8217;s trainer on Thanksgiving Day.
Danny and Bethany use the Android version constantly and vouch for it being super useful.

  <a href=\\"http://andybrett.com\\">

  is the mastermind behind both the iPhone app and this blog post. 
The app was recently described as &#8220;the most beautiful app ever to grace my home screen&#8221; by an anonymous participant in a recent IM conversation.
It also wasn&#8217;t hard to convince him to work on the this project, but recently it has been difficult to get him to stop ogling screenshots. 
This was his first foray into the world of Objective C, so he now has a love-hate relationship with Xcode. 
His favorite feature of the app is that it saves the last datapoint you entered as the default value for next time. 
It makes entering &#8220;1,000&#8221; every day on his pushups goal super easy.

  Funny story about scrapping the original version of cleverly escalating and recurring reminders.
Automated harassment is a hard, and highly susceptible to wolf-crying problems.
We ended up going back to the basics &#8212; one notification when you go into the wrong lane and one at the &#8220;panic threshold&#8221;, which is customizable in advanced settings on the website.

<p>
  The Beeminder + Complice integration gets better and better. 
I&#8217;m really excited to announce that you can now beemind almost anything automatically via Complice.
</p>
<p>
  Specifically, there&#8217;s a system that lets you match tasks that:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    go towards a specific Complice goal
  </li>
  <li>
    contain certain text (substring or regular expression)
  </li>
  <li>
    are starred
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  &#8230;and then track:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    completion
  </li>
  <li>
    pomodoros
  </li>
  <li>
    numbers
  </li>
  <li>
    sums of numbers
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  &#8230;with a bonus feature of being able to multiply the number on its way to Beeminder. 
And of course, as with the rest of the Complice + Beeminder integrations, you can create new Beeminder goals from right within Complice, making it easy to quickly set up a dozen things to track.
</p>

You put in a list of things you intend to do today, then you (in theory) do them and check them off. 
At the end of the day, you briefly remark on the progress you made towards various long-term goals.

  . 
The feature featured in this post lets you beemind various metrics from these tasks.)
</p>
<h2>
  Completion
</h2>
<p>
  Complice only sends datapoints to Beeminder when you check these tasks off, not when you edit them in the outcomes submission process. 
This is true of all of the Arbitrary trackers outlined below. 
If you have something you want to do last minute before bed and won&#8217;t log until the morning, change your Complice day-start-time to a few hours after you get up so you have a chance to log it.
</p>
<h3>
  Track your Complice dailies
</h3>
<p>
  If you&#8217;re using the format where you put &#8220;(&#8221; in front of your daily tasks, eg &#8220;
  <strong>
    (~) get up without pressing the snooze button
  </strong>
  &#8221;
then you can track each completion of a daily task by beeminding using a regular expression that checks to see if the task starts with a &#8220;(&#8220;:

<h3>
  Track some specific kind of task
</h3>
<p>
  Maybe within a given goal you want to do some reading, any reading, each day. 
Great, use:

</p>
<h2>
  Pomodoros
</h2>
<p>
  Just like the old basic pomodoro-beeminding systems, pomodoros are tracked whether the task is completed or not. 
Because hey, you still did that work.
</p>
<h3>
  Track only starred pomodoros
</h3>
<p>
  Want to track only pomodoros done towards starred tasks? Easy.
</p>
<p>
  <img
    src=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/complice-starred-pomos.png\\"
    width=\\"100%\\"
    alt=\\"Screenshot for starred pomodoros\\"
    title=\\"Screenshot for starred pomodoros\\"
  >
</p>
<h3>
  Track pomodoros as minutes
</h3>
<p>
  Someone on the Beeminder forums wanted to beemind pomodoros towards their writing goal as minutes, to add to a goal that also had other input. 
That&#8217;s also easy! 
Just multiply the pomodoro count by 25.

</p>
<h2>
  Numbers
</h2>
<p>
  You can use this for lots of things! 
Track workouts or pages read or sales calls made, or the level you got your inbox to. It correctly identifies negative numbers and decimals. 
(Times &#8212; e.g. &#8220;8:30&#8221; &#8212; don&#8217;t work, though if there&#8217;s an appetite for that I could add it.)
</p>
<h3>
  Track the time you spend doing something
</h3>
<p>
  Here I&#8217;m tracking however many minutes I spend doing meditation each day:
</p>
<p>
  <img

    title=\\"Screenshot for meditating\\"
  >
</p>
<h3>
  Track multiple values in the same task
</h3>
<p>
  This is another one from my personal trackstack, to track my calories in one goal (do-less) and my protein consumption in another goal (do-more). 
I use the regular expressions to send each number where it needs to go.
If you have a match group in the regex and the match group matches for numbers, then it&#8217;ll send that specific number rather than the last number in the task name.
</p>

</p>
<h2>
  Sums
</h2>
<p>
  Note that both this one and the numbers one only trigger for completed tasks.
Otherwise if you put in &#8220;meditate for 10 minutes&#8221; and then didn&#8217;t check it off, it would send a 10 to Beeminder anyway.
</p>
<h3>
  Track seconds of handstand practice
</h3>
<p>
  So the numbers thing is great, but what if you want to gradually add to it throughout the day? 
Since Complice tasks are uneditable (to keep you focused) you have to append text. 
But if you do 41 seconds of handstand practice, then another 43, then another 37, do you want to have to add those up yourself? 
Much easier to just put &#8220;41 + 43 + 37&#8221; and have Complice do the math.
</p>
<p>
  So that&#8217;s possible too! 
And you don&#8217;t need the plus sign. 
You can just put in the numbers, space separated or comma separated or whatever. 
But you can also do negative numbers, and you can have a space between the &#8220;
  <strong>
    <code>
      ?
    </code>
  </strong>
  &#8221; and the number, which means you can basically just do addition and subtraction. 
As with the Numbers mode, decimal values work too.
</p>
<p>
  And since the Beeminder comment gets the full task name, you can see from the comment that this 121 seconds of handstand practice was composed of three pieces, etc.

</h3>
<p>
  I haven&#8217;t tried this myself, but I&#8217;ve heard of people giving arbitrary actions point values for themselves, and beeminding some number of daily points. 
So maybe you get +5 points for every 10 minutes before your alarm you get out of bed, and -5 points for each time you hit the snooze button, and a point for each serving of vegetables, and -10 points for each cigarette you smoke.
</p>
<p>
  You can then make a Complice task called &#8220;&amp;) track points:&#8221; and then by the end of the day it might look like:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    &amp;) track points: +15 got up early, -10 smoke, +3 veg, +1 stairs, +2 veg
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  and this will send an &#8220;11&#8221; datapoint to Beeminder when you tick off the task.
</p>

<p>
  WordPress is the de facto tool for building blogs and, as Danny said last time, it served Beeminder well for many years.
But now we&#8217;re using a static site generator called
  <a
    href=\\"https://astro.build\\"
    title=\\"You can&#39;t go wrong with a tool whose website has a TLD of build, right?\\"
  >
    Astro
  </a>
  . 
Let&#8217;s talk about why and how!
</p>
<p>
  We&#8217;ll start with the downsides of WordPress.
WordPress is a server-rendered content management system. 
That means that whenever you visit a page on a WordPress website, WordPress retrieves that page&#8217;s data from a database, renders it to HTML, and sends it to you.
</p>
<p>
  <img
    src=\\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4655422/266149193-f7f05af8-aaea-4fa9-98dc-9884e01b7b06.png\\"
    alt=\\"Dynamic website architecture\\"
    title=\\"Browser requests page -&gt; Server gathers data -&gt; Server builds page -&gt; Server returns page\\"
  >
</p>
<p>
  This architecture is powerful &#8212; it allows websites to tailor each page for the current user. 
And in WordPress&#8217;s case it allows non-technical admins to build and customize their sites, no coding required.
</p>
<h3>
  The Idea
</h3>
<p>
  There&#8217;s an alternative &#8212; the static site. 
A static site is simply a set of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, served as-is, without waiting for the server to painstakingly construct them before sending them to you.
</p>
<p>
  <img
    src=\\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4655422/266149192-a882668a-2fdb-4bed-8ad5-4d76832fa948.png\\"
    alt=\\"Static website architecture\\"
    title=\\"Browser requests page -&gt; Server returns static page\\"
  >
</p>
<p>
  It would be impractical to build most websites this way. 
Hand coding HTML files for every post on the Beeminder blog would be painful. 
And then a change to the footer, say, would require editing every HTML file again.
</p>
<p>
  But what if we did that WordPress-style page construction all at once, one time?
Then we&#8217;d have a set of static files.
We call that one-time painstaking construction the build step.
</p>
<p>
  <img
    src=\\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4655422/266149190-2f985f24-1b03-436f-a683-160589d98333.png\\"
    alt=\\"Static website architecture with builds\\"
    title=\\"Static build is triggered -&gt; blah blah like WordPress but for every single page on the website all at once. And then from then on it&#39;s the same as the diagram above for a static site.\\"
  >
</p>
<p>
  Whenever you add a new blog post, or change anything in an old blog post, or change anything at all about the website, you trigger a build.
The Static Site Generator does its WordPressing, as we&#8217;ll call it, to every page and blog post on the whole site again.
But, crucially, it&#8217;s not doing this in real time with eager blog readers waiting for it.
It regenerates the static site and when the new files are ready, it swaps the old ones out and the new ones in.
End users are only ever asking for and getting served static pages.
</p>
<p>
  Basically we have the best of both worlds: let the build process do all the HTML generating, putting the same footer on every page and all that, but let end users get served simple static pages.
It&#8217;s also more secure.
WordPress has a whole admin interface to let you add posts and modify the site &#8212; a static site needs none of that.
And it&#8217;s drastically cheaper (or even free, depending on how much traffic it gets) to host a static site.
And content delivery networks (CDNs) can cache those files closer to end users which adds to the speed advantage.
</p>
<p>
  The Beeminder blog is particularly well-situated to take advantage of all of those benefits. 
Its content is primarily static. 
The non-static bits (like the comments) can use third-party embeds. 
Beeminder&#8217;s staff are technical and not code-shy (so no need for everything to be WYSIWYG). 
And Beeminder had been spending a lot on blog hosting.
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    (Danny adds: Does this mean the migration paid for itself?
Haha, no.
We initially thought it might &#8212; we were paying around $1k/year for WordPress hosting &#8212; but then decided we didn&#8217;t care.
We really like this new system!
And it might eventually pay off even just money-wise, who knows?)
  </em>
</p>
<h3>
  Objectives &amp; Requirements
</h3>
<p>
  Alright, enough why, let&#8217;s run through the what and how!
We had some specific boxes that we wanted the new blog to tick. 
First, we needed to preserve what the Beeminder team liked about their workflow.
That meant pulling in external markdown source files for each post, and being agnostic about where Beeminder may decide to store that markdown.
And builds needed to be fast enough that fixing a typo wouldn&#8217;t be excruciating.
</p>
<p>
  We also wanted the blog to be nice and maintainable &#8212; easy for future developers to improve the blog.
And of course not increasing Beeminder&#8217;s security exposure or other costs.
Like I said, security and cost should both be improved a lot by a static site generator.
</p>
<p>
  In terms of what users see when read the blog, we needed to
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/pareto\\"
    title=\\"Short version is that A Pareto-dominates B if A beats or ties B on every dimension you might care about\\"
  >
    Pareto-dominate
  </a>
  the old blog.
So of course all the old posts should stay the same, the RSS feed shouldn&#8217;t break.
Beeminder also has a bunch of fancy custom markdown augmentations like footnotes and LaTeX-style references that needed to keep functioning.
</p>
<p>
  And as icing on the cake, we wanted the blog to feel nicer for end users &#8212; faster and more modern and more in line with Beeminder&#8217;s visual identity.
</p>
<h3>
  Choosing a Static Site Generator
</h3>
<p>
  We needed to take our backlog of content and use a static site generator to convert that content into static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
</p>
<p>
  <a
    href=\\"https://jamstack.org/generators/\\"
    title=\\"Handy list of SSGs, at least as of 2023\\"
  >
    Many options exist
  </a>
  . 
I didn&#8217;t want to use those that I&#8217;d used previously.
  <a
    href=\\"https://jekyllrb.com/\\"
    title=\\"Very popular, Ruby-based\\"
  >
    Jekyll
  </a>
  &#8212; not my preferred stack.
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/\\"
    title=\\"People say it&#39;s great?\\"
  >
    Gatsby
  </a>
  &#8212; too unintuitive.
  <a
    href=\\"https://nextjs.org/\\"
    title=\\"Involves React\\"
  >
    Next.js
  </a>
  &#8212; too many unneeded features. 
Also Brent Yorgey recommended
  <a
    href=\\"https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll\\"
    title=\\"Like Jekyll but with Haskell\\"
  >
    Hakyll
  </a>
  which seems cool but he recommended it too late and it would have been hard since I&#8217;m bad at Haskell.
</p>
<p>
  One I hadn&#8217;t used previously was
  <a
    href=\\"https://astro.build/\\"
    title=\\"You can&#39;t go wrong with a tool whose website has a TLD of build, right?\\"
  >
    Astro
  </a>
  .
I watched
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TVy6GdtNuQ\\"
    title=\\"Svelte Crash Course\\"
  >
    a video
  </a>
  of someone building a simple site in Astro, and I was impressed. 
It seemed like our use case was exactly Astro&#8217;s happy path, which made me feel much more comfortable that I could spend more time executing and less time fighting with the framework. 
I also appreciated that I could use my preferred stack &#8212; node, pnpm, typescript, vitest. 
I liked how the default Astro templating language is JSX-like, and how it co-locates server JS, client JS, HTML, and CSS in each component file. 
I also really liked that it comes with folder structure routing out of the box. 
And I liked how easy it makes using external data in static generation, just using the standard fetch API.
</p>
<p>
  Astro had everything we wanted. 
It has file-based routing with dynamic route segments and simple route-based data fetching. 
It&#8217;s written in JavaScript and supports TypeScript out of the box. 
It uses file-based components. 
The Astro templating format is close enough to JSX to make a React developer feel at home, while sidestepping all the complexity that comes from using React. 
It&#8217;s built on Vite, making for good build performance. 
And it has an RSS plugin which made setting up our feed quite simple.
</p>
<p>
  Additionally Astro proved beneficial in several other ways that we didn&#8217;t think to look for. 
It has built-in link prefetching. 
It includes experimental support for image optimization (still working on setting that up!) and static redirects. 
 
And it has a hot-reloading local dev server.
</p>
<h3>
  Choosing a Host
</h3>
<p>
  Danny suggested Render.com. 
I hadn&#8217;t used it before, but I&#8217;m glad we did. 
It was a great experience. 
I&#8217;ve never enjoyed deploying to AWS or Google Cloud. 
In contrast, Render.com integrates with GitHub, providing painless git-triggered deployments. 
Also blueprints.
</p>
<p>
  Initially I planned to have GitHub Actions run our builds. 
I planned to take the custom PHP code from Beeminder&#8217;s WordPress plugin and run it as a stand-alone PHP proxy in front of Etherpad inside the build action.
That way I could avoid reimplementing the custom functionality from the old blog for things like footnotes. 
The Continuous Integration (CI) action would then deploy the built blog to whatever static host we settled on.
</p>
<p>
  However Render.com has its own Netlify-style static site builds, so no need for GitHub Actions. 
Instead I reimplemented the custom logic in TypeScript. 
While this meant more effort in reproducing the features from the old blog, it kept the deploy pipeline much simpler and kept everything in the main TypeScript codebase, which I think was the right call for long-term maintainability.
</p>
<h3>
  Migrating the Data
</h3>
<p>
  Beeminder hosts the raw markdown behind the blog posts in an Etherpad instance separate from WordPress, so we didn&#8217;t need to worry about exporting post content from WordPress. 
But we still needed to export post metadata, including the Etherpad source URLs, as well as some info about the authors, and then use that data in the builds for old posts that aren&#8217;t using the new markdown frontmatter.
</p>
<p>
  I used two WordPress plugins to export the data &#8212; one for posts and one for users. 
I then took this data, imported it into Google Sheets, and exported just the columns we needed into CSV files which are stored in the blog repository.
</p>
<p>
  At build time the code uses these CSV files to look up information about posts that were written before the blog rewrite. 
For new posts, this meta information will be stored in frontmatter at the top of the markdown files.
</p>
<h3>
  Build Optimization
</h3>
<p>
  I spent too much time optimizing build performance. 
It&#8217;s a fun puzzle.
</p>
<p>
  I
  <a
    href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization\\"
    title=\\"Not to be confused with Memorization, points out Wikipedia, helpfully\\"
  >
    memoized
  </a>
  liberally. 
You don&#8217;t want to repeat any expensive computations.
In addition I cached the raw markdown we requested from Etherpad. 
In a production build, this is cached in-memory. 
Locally (i.e., in development) it&#8217;s cached in the filesystem to avoid needing to wait for a bunch of requests to finish before seeing the result of a test build.
</p>
<p>
  There are some fancy markdown features that I needed to use a virtual DOM library to implement. 
I started by using
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsdom\\"
    title=\\"Excerpt: jsdom is a pure-JavaScript implementation of many web standards, notably the WHATWG DOM and HTML Standards, for use with Node.js\\"
  >
    jsdom
  </a>
  , 
but this was very slow. 
I ended up switching to
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/happy-dom\\"
    title=\\"Excerpt: Happy DOM is a JavaScript implementation of a web browser without its graphical user interface. It includes many web standards from WHATWG DOM and HTML. The goal of Happy DOM is to emulate enough of a web browser to be useful for testing, scraping web sites and server-side rendering. Happy DOM focuses heavily on performance and can be used as an alternative to JSDOM.\\"
  >
    happy-dom
  </a>
  and it was much faster.
</p>
<p>
  When I first started fetching markdown from Etherpad, I made all the requests at once. 
This flooded Beeminder&#8217;s Etherpad instance and caused our builds to fail. 
I switched to doing these requests synchronously, which allowed the builds to complete, but made builds take a long time. 
Finally I switched to using
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/p-limit\\"
    title=\\"Excerpt: Run multiple promise-returning &amp; async functions with limited concurrency\\"
  >
    p-limit
  </a>
  to send the requests as fast as possible while limiting the number of simultaneously-active requests. 
I tested that limit, timing different values, until I found one that was optimal for build speed and reliability.
</p>
<p>
  <br>
  &nbsp;
  <br>
</p>
<p>
  In conclusion&#8230; voila?
Goodbye WordPress, hello Astro.
And it&#8217;s being served by Render.com at zero monthly cost.
Here&#8217;s the full final stack in case you got bored partway through the above and are jumping here for the punchline:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Pnpm - package manager
  </li>
  <li>
    Zod - data schemas and transforms
  </li>
  <li>
    Astro - static site generator
  </li>
  <li>
    Vitest - testing framework
  </li>
  <li>
    Happy-dom - virtual dom
  </li>
  <li>
    Render.com - hosting and builds
  </li>
  <li>
    GitHub - version control and ci

<h3>
  Preamble
</h3>
<p>
  Here are two facts about elite athletes that sound contradictory at first blush but aren&#8217;t:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Elite athletes, being more efficient at propelling themselves, burn fewer calories per mile than muggles.
  </li>
  <li>
    Elite athletes, being better at turning calories into motion, burn more calories per hour than muggles.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  It all makes sense when you think about it. 
Olympians are fuel-efficient, meaning they can do a lot with a little fuel, but also they&#8217;re very good at quickly transforming fuel into motion.
</p>
<p>
  As Greg LeMond famously put it, it doesn&#8217;t get easier, you just go faster. 
But if you
  <em>
    don&#8217;t
  </em>
  go faster, then, yeah, it&#8217;ll get easier.
</p>
<p>
  Elite athletes simultaneously burn fewer calories
  <em>
    per mile
  </em>
  and more calories
  <em>
    per hour
  </em>
  . 
How? By going many more miles in that hour than a normal human.
</p>
<p>
  Paradox resolved!
</p>
<h3>
  The Actual Beeminder Part
</h3>
<p>
  So should you beemind miles or hours or miles per hour? 
Our answer is that hours is safest and simplest.
Commit to putting in the time, at whatever level you&#8217;re currently capable of.
It&#8217;s nice and predictable.
</p>
<p>
  Miles is fine too.
By which we mean distance.
(Sorry for the imperial units but &#8220;miles&#8221; is a lot easier to say than &#8220;kilometers&#8221;!
Depending on the sport, this could also be laps or vertical meters or steps or strokes or fathoms or furlongs.)
Distance may be a more interesting metric than duration and we do think
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.bmndr.co/whattomind\\"
    title=\\"Classic Beeminder blog post on picking a good metric to mind\\"
  >
    interestingness of the metric is paramount for beeminding
  </a>
  .
</p>
<p>
  But what if speed is what&#8217;s most interesting and important to you, as it might well be if you&#8217;re an aspiring elite athlete? 
Our answer is that that&#8217;s an outcome, not an action. 
So focus on beeminding the actions that help you get to the outcome. 
If you really want, go ahead and beemind speed too, just very conservatively. 
Use a shallow slope and low pledge cap. 
You don&#8217;t want to end up with an expensive beemergency you&#8217;re physically incapable of dispatching!
</p>
<p>
  To round this out, and in case it&#8217;s a helpful resource, here&#8217;s a whole list of athletic metrics that might make for beemindable metrics:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Duration
  </li>
  <li>
    Distance (horizontal or vertical)
  </li>
  <li>
    Speed (again, more outcome than action)
  </li>
  <li>
    Calories or kilojoules burned
  </li>
  <li>
    Power aka wattage (or multiply this by time to be more action than outcome, which is just calories or kilojoules)
  </li>
  <li>
    Cadence
  </li>
  <li>
    Hydration
  </li>
  <li>
    Time in heart rate zones
  </li>
  <li>

    >
      Weight
    </a>
    and body composition (standard warning about outcomes vs actions)
  </li>
  <li>
    Nutritional intake metrics (macro or micronutrients)
  </li>
  <li>
    Steps
  </li>
  <li>
    Number of intervals for HIIT training
  </li>
  <li>
    Total reps (e.g., pushups or pullups or squats)
  </li>
  <li>
    Volume load (weight lifted multiplied by reps and sets)
  </li>

  you signed up for, if it&#8217;s time to charge your credit card but you haven&#8217;t actually used Beeminder in the previous 30 days, we suppress the charge.
We think that&#8217;s especially important for the type of person who uses our service, but we frankly find it almost unconscionable that so many services are willing to cash in on the laziness of their formerly active customers.

  So we&#8217;d like to address our fellow startups:
Join us on the Light side!
Implement auto-canceling subscriptions!
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;If you show up again, charges resume.&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  It
  <em>
    might
  </em>
  leave money on the table, but you have to admit that it&#8217;s money you&#8217;re not truly earning.
In an ideal world &#8212; perhaps when this idea catches on, if you&#8217;ll allow us to dream &#8212; 
you’ll make up for that lost money from people who don&#8217;t sign up for trials at all because they don&#8217;t trust themselves to stay on top of canceling.
Those people (if I can generalize at all from myself) will be happy to try a subscription service that sounds promising if they&#8217;re free of the burden of deciding whether to cancel.
We should also note that we&#8217;ve implemented this as both auto-canceling and auto-resuming.
If you show up again, charges resume.
Still nothing for you to do or click.
</p>
<p>
  Of course, if you do actively want to stop, it&#8217;s one click to downgrade to the free plan at any time too.
In case you want to stop getting charged for premium features but still stick around.
You can also upgrade at any time and we&#8217;ll only charge you the difference.
You can even have refunds; we&#8217;re happy to guarantee that you&#8217;ll be happy with any money you spend on our premium plans.

  So how about it, fellow startups?
I don&#8217;t doubt that you have a million ways to rationalize continuing to take a customer&#8217;s money when all evidence suggests that it&#8217;s tantamount to a laziness tax.
But search your feelings &#8212; you know it to be true!

  That may sound like a hilariously ironic thing for us to say, given our business model. 
(We&#8217;re a commitment device service where you pledge money to stay on track towards your goals and if you go off track, you literally pay us.)
But we&#8217;re firmly committed to only making money from
  <em>
    fixing
  </em>
  laziness, procrastination, and head-in-the-sand syndrome &#8212; in a word, akrasia.
The timing of when we get paid &#8212; the moment that you succumb to akrasia &#8212; is

    perverse
  </a>
  but what you&#8217;re paying for is that you succumb less.
In any case, this post is not about that aspect of Beeminder.
For our premium plans we get paid like any other subscription service.

  Again, this is separate from the other part of Beeminder where we charge you money for going off track on your goals.
We can&#8217;t literally guarantee you&#8217;ll be literally happy about
  <em>
    those
  </em>
  payments since that would spoil the commitment device.
But in practice it seems to be a near guarantee.
People feel, almost always, that the pledges they&#8217;ve paid for derailing were worth it for how long the threat of said payments kept them on track.

<p>
  In case you&#8217;re not a programmer and the title didn&#8217;t already scare you off, we&#8217;ll start by explaining why this matters for end users.
Until now, anyone who wrote a 3rd-party autodata integration &#8212; automatically sending data to Beeminder &#8212; had to implement their own strategy for how often to check for new data.
Typically this would be something like every-hour-on-the-hour.
</p>
<p>
  But that can be super frustrating if Beeminder keeps bugging you for an hour after you already did your thing!
And much worse, if you&#8217;re down to the wire on your Beeminder deadline but the 3rd-party app doesn&#8217;t update Beeminder in time then Beeminder will think you derailed when you totally did finish in the nick of time!
</p>
<p>
  So the idea is that now Beeminder can tell the 3rd-party app, &#8220;hey we&#8217;re about to bug this user to do their thing so make sure all datapoints you know about are reflected in Beeminder before we do!&#8221;
This is much easier for 3rd-party developers because they can let Beeminder worry about when to do the autofetching.
And even better, it means you, the user, never need to visit the 3rd-party app again once your goal is set up.
You can hit the refresh button in Beeminder to force a new check for the latest data any time, just like with our official integrations.
</p>
<p>
  We&#8217;ve got one example of this already in action &#8212;

<h2>
  Nerds Start Here&#8212;Normal People You&#8217;re Done Now
</h2>
<p>
  So you&#8217;re building your 3rd-party Beeminder integration app and want to send data to Beeminder automatically from Your Favorite Service.
One of the things you&#8217;ve got to decide is
  <em>
    when
  </em>
  to send the data to Beeminder.
For some things (e.g., Runkeeper) the data is event-driven. 
You know when a new event happens and you just send it over to Beeminder when you get it. 
With other types of data (e.g., Fitbit) the data is continuously collected throughout the day and may be constantly changing.
</p>
<p>
  The reason to still care about this if you&#8217;re event-driven is so that we know to display the goal in the users gallery with a refresh button to fetch new data using your app.
(Even if you know your data is always up to date, the user doesn&#8217;t know that so having an autofetch button is reassuring for them.)
And also, though we haven&#8217;t implemented this part yet, we&#8217;ll want to show your app&#8217;s logo, like we currently do for official integrations:
</p>
<p>
  <img
    class=\\"aligncenter\\"

    alt=\\"integration logo in user gallery\\"
    title=\\"The duo owl makes an appearance in my gallery\\"
  >
</p>
<h3>
  What To Do
</h3>
<p>
  The implementation is pretty simple.
The idea is that we&#8217;ll
  <code>
    POST
  </code>
  to your callback URL whenever we want new data.
When you receive the
  <code>
    POST
  </code>
  &#8212; which includes parameters
  <code>
    username
  </code>
  and
  <code>
    slug
  </code>
  &#8212; you go update that goal. 
The callback should return a 200 response on success. 
If it&#8217;s possible for you to update the goal immediately inline in the response, that&#8217;s awesome, but we do time the request out after 30 seconds.
So if that will be slow you can queue up the work and give us a 200 response to let us know you got the message.
But as soon as we get a 200 from your callback, we&#8217;ll send the user their reminder or refresh their graph or whatever we&#8217;re doing on our end. 
So things could be confusing for the end user if you return a 200 before actually sending Beeminder the latest data.

  Other than implementing this callback endpoint, and

    registering it on Beeminder with your API client
  </a>
  , 
the other piece is that you need to let us know which goals are using your app. 
You will register goals to receive this callback by passing in
  <code>
    datasource=clientname
  </code>
  either when you

  Please ask lots of questions if you run into any roadblocks or any of this is confusing! 
We want for this to be easy.

<p>
  Also we want to help promote your app!
Our goal is to make 3rd-party apps work just as well as official ones and we&#8217;re almost there now.
Next we need a way for you to upload your app&#8217;s logo to use in the user&#8217;s gallery.
In the meantime, talk to us humans and we&#8217;ll make it happen!

</blockquote>
<p>
  We&#8217;ve finally officially, fully killed off the monstrosity known as auto-widening yellow brick roads!
If you&#8217;ve encountered this it was probably in the context of weight loss goals, though there are a tiny number of you who turned this Terrifyingly Advanced Setting on for some of your custom goals.
If you don&#8217;t know what we&#8217;re talking about, that&#8217;s totally fine!
You can probably skip this both parts of this two-part post.
</p>
<p>
  But since this is the just-the-facts part, here&#8217;s what it means in practical terms for us to remove this feature.
</p>
<h3>
  What do I need to know about beeminding weight now?
</h3>
<p>
  What we&#8217;re doing now 
(actually what we&#8217;ve been doing for a long time for new weight loss goals) 
is giving you a generous buffer when you start the goal to account for day-to-day weight fluctuations.
The road itself actually has zero width, foreshadowing some additional upcoming changes in all yellow brick roads.
Then it is up to you stay well below that bright line.
</p>
<h3>
  What if I already have an old-style weight road?
</h3>
<p>
  Existing roads are getting assigned a fixed road width.
In other words, whatever width your road is currently, it will stay put, with no more changes.
If you restart a frozen weight goal, then we&#8217;ll collect the
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/mercy/\\"
    title=\\"Previous blog post explaining the &#39;max daily fluctuation&#39; feature on weight loss goals\\"
  >
    max fluctuation
  </a>
  from you and convert your goal to a new-style weight road.
Otherwise we predict you won&#8217;t even notice this change.
</p>
<h3>
  What if I&#8217;m one of the elite few who turned on auto-widening for some other purpose?
</h3>
<p>
  As for weight loss goals, any active goal with auto-widening turned on will get a fixed road width (we&#8217;ll use whatever it currently is), and the road width will no longer change with the data. 
You can manually change the road&#8217;s width in the custom settings, where you turned it on in the first place.
(It was called &#8220;noisy&#8221; &#8212; referring to goals with randomly fluctuating data.)
Unfortunately, you&#8217;re probably the users most affected by this, but at least we&#8217;re

    on the hook
  </a>
  to justify ourselves to you! 
(In Part 2 of this post.)
Any archived goals, should they be restarted, will act as any ordinary Beeminder goal with a road width based on the rate of the road.

<p>
  For years we&#8217;ve mentioned on the blog and elsewhere that loss aversion is part of the behavioral economics that Beeminder is based on.
We&#8217;re now recanting that.
</p>
<p>
  This might sound like Ben &amp; Jerry&#8217;s disavowing ice cream.
Isn&#8217;t &#8220;stay on track or LOSE MONEY&#8221; our whole shtick?
Isn&#8217;t being averse to the &#8220;LOSE MONEY&#8221; part the entire basis of that threat being motivating?
</p>
<p>
  Yes yes, but that&#8217;s just loss aversion in the most literal sense.
We&#8217;re not disavowing incentives altogether.
Loss aversion in the behavioral economic sense is a specific rationality failure and it&#8217;s that that we&#8217;re disclaiming.
</p>
<p>
  Our current stance is that loss aversion may

  !) magnify how much you&#8217;re motivated by the threat of Beeminder&#8217;s sting but that&#8217;s not fundamental to the motivation Beeminder provides.
</p>
<h3>
  Magnifying motivation? Like what anti-charities do?
</h3>
<p>
  Yes, and we&#8217;ve always

    hated anti-charities
  </a>
  . 
Anti-charities are a way to get more motivation per dollar at risk.
Instead of paying Beeminder when you derail, you donate money to the Ku Klux Klan or something.
Multiplying the per-dollar motivation is not inherently valuable.
(And it&#8217;s certainly not worth the risk of donating to the KKK.)
Just multiply the number of actual dollars at risk instead!
</p>
<p>
  It&#8217;s the same thing with loss aversion.
If you&#8217;re irrationally over-motivated by losses, you can go ahead and overcome that cognitive bias and then just up your Beeminder pledges to achieve the same motivation.

<h3>
  What about Paul Fenwick invoicing clients?
</h3>
<p>
  This is a classic case where we&#8217;ve referred to loss aversion but actually meant something else.
First let&#8217;s paraphrase our friend
  <a
    href=\\"http://pjf.id.au/\\"
    title=\\"Paul originally made this point in an OSCON talk in 2012\\"

    Paul Fenwick

  :
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    I beemind invoicing clients. 
The invoices are for thousands of dollars. 
Yet that does not motivate me to get the invoice sent out. 
What motivates me is the threat of losing $5 to Beeminder because my &#8220;send invoices&#8221; goal is red. 
Without the goal, I never send the invoices (or put them off preposterously long etc).
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  The $5 (and the &#8220;oh! Beeminder says I screwed up!&#8221;) is a concrete thing that is happening Right Now (or in 3 hours or whatever), whereas the invoice, you send it out, and then the client pays you at some arbitrary point in the future when they feel like it, and so the deadline for sending the invoice is pretty wobbly.
The payout is huge, but you don&#8217;t really know when it&#8217;s coming, and sending the invoice 3 days sooner doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;ll get the money any sooner.
Each day, from now to eternity, you think &#8220;well, one more day won&#8217;t hurt&#8221;.
Unless you make it so one more day
  <em>
    does
  </em>
  hurt.
</p>
<p>
  And
  <em>
    that
  </em>
  is the behavioral economic secret of Beeminder.

<h3>
  Present bias
</h3>
<p>
  Beeminder is fundamentally about bringing long-term consequences near aka overcoming

    present bias
  </a>
  and not at all about the loss/gain asymmetry.
That asymmetry is irrational and people should fix it and if Beeminder depended on it, that would not be cool of us.
</p>
<p>
  In conclusion, loss aversion is a cognitive bias that we have no interest in exploiting and would prefer to help correct for.

  Beeminder doesn&#8217;t even inherently prefer loss to gains, motivation-wise.
If we could give payouts for staying on the right side of the bright red line &#8212; instead of penalties for crossing it &#8212; that may be motivationally ideal.

But that question is moot because Beeminder has no funding source for that. 
I mean, we could use the money we collect from derailments to pay people for not derailing but we view

<p>
  Hi, I&#8217;m Manasvini from Boss as a Service!
</p>
<p>
  Boss as a Service is a human accountability service. 
What’s that? 
Well, we help you stay on track to your goals, by giving you a “Boss.” 
A living, breathing human being, who will check in on you, and hold you accountable to achieving your goals.
</p>
<p>
  If you’ve ever noticed that it&#8217;s easier to get stuff done at work than it is to hit your personal goals, you probably know the magic of human accountability.
</p>
<p>
  Personally, I felt this keenly when I quit my job and struck out on my own a few years ago.
</p>
<p>
  I rapidly found myself tumbling into productivity hell, where absolutely nothing got done. 
I made some vague plans, but the few deadlines I set whizzed past me, with nobody to enforce them.
</p>
<p>
  As I scrambled to piece back some discipline into my life, I found myself thinking back almost wistfully to when I had a full-time job.
</p>
<p>
  When I worked for someone else, I never missed a single client deadline. 
Because other people&#8217;s work depends on your coming through, and you wouldn&#8217;t let them down.
</p>
<p>
  But it turns out that it&#8217;s very easy to let yourself down all the time. 
And having a Boss &#8212; someone to ask you why you haven’t done what you’re supposed to do &#8212; is actually a bit of a productivity hack.
</p>
<p>
  Boss as a Service aims to provide that system of accountability to those who don’t have it. 
Maybe you don’t have it at work, or maybe you work for yourself. 
Or perhaps you have it at work, and want it to make sure you hit your personal goals. 
Either way, if you’re akratic like me, a Boss is a great secret weapon to have!
</p>
<h2>
  How Boss as a Service works
</h2>
<p>
  BaaS is super simple to get started with.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>
        Send your Boss your todos
      </strong>
      . 
You commit directly to your Boss and tell them what you’re working on, and what your deadlines are. 
Choose whichever medium you&#8217;re most active on &#8212; we support email, Whatsapp, and Telegram right now &#8212; and we get started right away. 
We have no interface, no todo app or forms, just committing to a real person via direct chat. 
(We really find that committing to a person is more powerful than writing down a task in an app.)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>
        Send us proof that you did it!
      </strong>
      When you complete your tasks (woohoo, go you!) we ask for proof. 
Most of the times, a screenshot or photo works great. 
For example, if you went running, you could give us a screenshot of Strava or Runkeeper.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>
        Or we&#8217;ll keep bugging you.
      </strong>
      If you don’t finish your tasks, we do exactly what a real boss would do. 
We ask questions. 
What happened? 
Why didn’t you finish it? 
How can we ensure you’ll get it done tomorrow? 
And we’ll follow up (read: keep bugging you!) till it’s resolved.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>
        Till you get everything done!
      </strong>
      You consistently hit your goals and ascend to the higher planes of productive awesomeness.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>
  How Beeminder and BaaS work together
</h2>
<p>
  If you’re already using Beeminder, BaaS can complement it nicely, and combining the two can be very powerful. 
BaaS adds an extra layer of accountability between you and your Beeminder goal.
</p>
<p>
  Your Boss will keep track of your goal. 
And if you don’t get your task done &#8212; well, we’ll rat you out to Beeminder. 
(Sorry but not sorry.) 
And Beeminder will then derail you.
</p>
<p>
  When you know someone’s watching you, there’s a lot less temptation to weasel out. 
Not to mention, you have to prove that you completed the task to BaaS &#8212; so essentially you’re

    title=\\"Weasel-Proofing and the Definition of Legitimacy\\"
  >
    weasel-proofing
  </a>
  the goal.
</p>
<p>
  Plus when someone’s waiting for updates, cheering you on and holding you accountable, you’re that much more motivated to get stuff done!
</p>
<h2>
  How do I get started with Beeminder + BaaS?
</h2>
<h3>
  Step 1: Create a Beeminder goal
</h3>
<p>
  Figure out what type of Beeminder goal will suit your task best. 
As you probably know, Beeminder has two main types of goals &#8212;
  <a
    href=\\"https://help.beeminder.com/article/66-do-more-goals\\"
    title=\\"Beeminder help article about do-more goals\\"

  </a>
  and

    title=\\"Beeminder help article about do-less goals\\"
  >
    Do Less
  </a>
  .
</p>
<h4>
  Setting up a BaaS Do More Goal
</h4>
<p>
  A “Do More” goal is something you want to do more of &#8212; like working out. 
So every time you work out, and send us proof that you&#8217;ve worked out, BaaS will send a datapoint to Beeminder.
[UPDATE: BaaS user Evan Wolfenden has
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/evanwolfenden16/productive_day\\"
    title=\\"Shared with permission\\"
  >
    an example
  </a>
  of how a Do More goal with BaaS might look like.]
</p>
<p>
  One caveat &#8212; we’ll need to make sure you send your updates in good time. 
If you send us your update close to derailment time, your Boss may not have time enough to verify your proof and send a datapoint to Beeminder before it ends up derailing.
</p>
<h4>
  Setting up a BaaS Do Less Goal
</h4>
<p>
  A “Do Less” goal, on the other hand, is one that you want to do less of. 
For example, “eating less than 1 sugary treat a day.”
</p>
<p>
  You can make a catch-all Do Less goal by framing it as “Not missing a commitment submitted to my Boss&#8221;. 
Then you can just start sending BaaS your daily tasks &#8212; and any time you do miss completing a task / proving it, BaaS will send Beeminder a datapoint.
</p>
<p>
  You avoid the risk of accidental derailing with Do Less goals, since BaaS will only send a datapoint when you fail. 
Make sure that your

    some great fine print for inspiration
  </a>
  , on a Do Less goal, thanks to Aian!
</p>
<p>
  And if you&#8217;d like to brainstorm, your Boss can help out any time!
</p>
<p>
  Once you figure out what type of goal is best for you, just create your Beeminder goal.
</p>
<h3>
  Step 2: Tell your Boss.
</h3>
<p>
  Let your Boss know the goal URL. 
That’s all you need to do!
We send datapoints using Beeminder&#8217;s email bot with special dispensation from Beeminder and don’t need your account credentials or passwords. 
(And feel free to use Beeminder as usual for your other goals &#8212; it won’t affect your BaaS goals in any way!)
</p>
<h3>
  Step 3: Get working on those goals!
</h3>
<p>
  Now it’s time to start working and hitting those goals! 
We’re in this together and we can get this done!
</p>
<p>
  To wrap up, here are some quick tips and ideas to get the maximum from BaaS.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Beemind your daily BaaS check-ins! 
This works really well to make sure that you’re planning the day out every morning, and committing the plan to your Boss.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      It&#8217;s great to schedule a weekly / even daily retrospective with your Boss! 
Do some strategic thinking, what went right, what went wrong this week, and how to fix it next time round. 
We nudge you to introspect about these questions regularly as well.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Be active! 
Send us daily / weekly goals! We see people who&#8217;re interacting more, end up getting more done. 
Shorter feedback loops and a quick retrospective every day means you find your sweet spot and hit your stride quickly!
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

  Here&#8217;s a question from a user:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Sometimes it seems like a hard workout makes me
    <em>
      gain
    </em>
    weight. My question is: WTF?
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Melanie, Beeminder&#8217;s resident fitness expert, has an answer:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Temporary weight gain for a day or two after a hard workout is common.
Your body is storing glucose &#8212; quick energy &#8212; and glucose carries a lot of water.
Why does your body do this?
It&#8217;s responding to the workout by storing extra energy in the muscles, both for repair and to be more prepared for future hard work.
  </p>
  <p>
    Glucose, energy, calories &#8212; it&#8217;s all the same thing and the more you store in your muscles the less you&#8217;ll store as fat.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Of course, a hard workout is one of many things that can cause your weight to fluctuate, seemingly randomly (or truly randomly).
Which is why your yellow brick road isn&#8217;t just a line.
In fact, as we explained in 
&#8220;
  <a

  &#8221;,
your yellow brick road automatically widens to accommodate such fluctuations.
(UPDATE 2014: For the

</p>
<p>
  So any temporary weight gain is of course no reason to hold back on your workouts.

  In 2018 we were setting up an ad campaign through a program with Google (which is itself a long story, but not a funny one) and they wanted to &#8220;make sure our website was backed up&#8221; and I was&#8230; I guess horrified that that&#8217;s a question they even have to ask people?
Even for normal people in 2018 it seemed like this would be a total non-question. 
Keep everything in the cloud and you don&#8217;t even need to think about the concept of backups. 
It&#8217;s magic!
Unless World War 3, climate change, rogue AI, etc manage to bring down the whole internet, I guess.
</p>
<p>
  With version control like we have with GitHub, it&#8217;s not just the website that&#8217;s automatically backed up but every version of it that&#8217;s ever existed. 
Programmers are
  <em>
    really
  </em>
  serious about making sure they never lose any work due to computers, or themselves, flaking out. 
This is something normal people really need more of. 
Like it&#8217;s not enough to have a document backed up. 
If you mess it all up somehow, you need to be able to go back to any point in time to see how it used to look.
</p>
<p>
  Anyway, this Google Ads person wanted to make sure our website was backed up.
Sometimes we get imposter syndrome &#8212; 
&#8220;how are we even running a company?&#8221; or
&#8220;how does the internet actually work? nameservers vs registrars, what? omg I feel so dumb!&#8221; &#8212; 
but apparently there are businesses out there where the only place the code exists is what&#8217;s running in production.
That was a very long way to say that we definitely have the website backed up oh my goodness can you imagine.
</p>
<p>
  But this reminds me of how my grandma had her entire dissertation destroyed by a bomb in World War II.
True story!
</p>
<p>
  Fortunately Beeminder is on multilpe people&#8217;s laptops all over the world, plus all the ways GitHub itself backs up repositories.
So losing Beeminder (the code/website) would take a pretty apocalyptic scenario.
But I&#8217;m going to stop tempting fate now.

    Hey _____, we&#8217;re always super worried about breaking Beeminder&#8217;s incentives in cases like this! 
Any kind of &#8220;just this once&#8221; exception is a perilously slippery slope, as you can imagine. 
Arguably the point of Beeminder is to make sure important goals don&#8217;t get crowded out when things get busy. 
(We&#8217;d love to nerd out about the philosophy and behavioral economics of this kind of thing if you have more thoughts!) 
Can you formulate a general principle that would apply to this and all future similar cases where it would make sense to call such derailments not legit?

</blockquote>
<p>
  It’s common for people to actually decide to feel

Once in a while the person will formulate a totally sensible general principle.

    Oh my, you&#8217;ve opened up a philosophical can of worms here.

    >
      this blog post
    </a>
    .
We consider it pretty fundamental to Beeminder that there&#8217;s a single unambiguous very bright line for what constitutes a derailment.
Having said that, unless you weaselproof the goal, it&#8217;s ultimately up to you whether it&#8217;s legit. 
(Just make sure to reply to the legit check within 24 hours.)
    <br>
    &nbsp;
    <br>
    More generally, our philosophy is to be as generous as we can possibly justify being but it should always be in terms of a universal policy that we&#8217;re happy to commit to following in all future similar situations. 
Like how any derailment that can at all be classified as a technicality is always grounds for stopping a charge. 
But if you try to commit to a &#8220;close enough&#8221; policy then you have to define what that means. 
Like &#8220;within 1% of the edge of the road&#8221;. 
But then either that&#8217;s merely a new bright line (one that&#8217;s harder to reason about by having been obscured) or the &#8220;close enough&#8221; policy applies recursively, which, again, slippery slope. 
A possible counterargument is that having a strict nominal limit and more lenient actual limit kind of tricks you into building more safety buffer. 
We&#8217;re very certain that backfires. 
Having the faintest inkling that there exists some leniency will immediately translate, psychologically, to correspondingly more reckless edge skating.
    <br>
    &nbsp;
    <br>
    Ok, we&#8217;ve clearly thought about this stuff to a ridiculous extent but it also means we could really use feedback from new users. 
It doesn&#8217;t matter if we&#8217;re philosophically and behaviorally economically right if we come off as inflexible jerks! :) 
Also we love nerding out about the philosophy of this stuff if you have more thoughts!

  &#8220;I just got really busy. Can I have my money back?&#8221;
</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Oh no! Let us argue a bit, not for the sake of the money but because Beeminder is arguably failing at upholding the primary thing it promises to do (enforce consequences on commitments) if we say yes to this. 
[Here we&#8217;d repeat the argument that the whole point of Beeminder is to commit to doing things despite getting busy and soliciting a general principle by which it could make sense to call this non-legit instead of a just-this-once thing.]
And sometimes it&#8217;s about us having done a poor job of informing the user about the options, like &#8220;I didn&#8217;t realize I could change my rate for next week when I knew a big work project was due&#8221; for example.

    Toward a Bayesian Theory of Willpower
  </a>
  &#8221;. 
This is my recap of the theory, my tentative verdict, and what I think it means for Beeminder and motivation hacking more generally.
</p>
<p>
  Let&#8217;s start with defining terms!
  <em>
    Akrasia
  </em>
  means failing to do something you rationally want to do. 
Not just something you 
&#8220;

Something you genuinely want to do, and

    title=\\"The Want-Can-Will Test for Akrasia\\"
  >
    can
  </a>
  do, yet somehow fail to do. 
Akrasia is the name for that &#8220;somehow&#8221;.
  <em>
    Willpower
  </em>
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/willpower\\"
    title=\\"What is Willpower? Followup to our post on Ego Depletion\\"
  >
    means
  </a>
  overcoming that problem via pure introspection.
</p>
<p>
  Scott Alexander&#8217;s theory says that your brain collects and weights evidence from different mental subprocesses to determine every action you take. 
The three subprocesses are:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Do nothing
  </li>
  <li>
    Do what&#8217;s most immediately rewarding
  </li>
  <li>
    Do what you consciously deem best
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  These all submit evidence via dopamine to your basal ganglia and the winner determines what action you take. 
There&#8217;s a high prior probability on &#8220;do nothing&#8221; being best, which can be overridden by high enough anticipation of reward, which can be overridden by high enough evidence from your conscious mind.
</p>
<p>
  In this theory, akrasia &#8212; Scott Alexander says &#8220;lack of willpower&#8221; &#8212; is an imbalance in these subprocesses. 
Physiologically maybe that means insufficient dopamine in your frontal cortex such that the evidence from your conscious brain is underweighted. 
(Dopaminergic drugs seem to increase willpower so I guess that argues in favor of the theory? I&#8217;m so out of my depth here.) 
Hacking your motivation would mean increasing the evidence supplied by your intellectual/logical brain.
</p>
<h3>
  Hyperbolic Discounting
</h3>
<p>
  Many decades before that, various psychologists and economists came up with a dynamic inconsistency / hyperbolic discounting theory. 
Your brain does whatever maximizes the net present value of expected future utility (i.e., you figure out the optimal thing and then do it) except your future-discounting is broken. 
That&#8217;s the akrasia. 
You over-weight immediate consequences.
</p>
<h3>
  Everything Is A Nail?
</h3>
<p>
  Under hyperbolic discounting my answer is &#8220;use commitment devices to bring long-term consequences near!&#8221;. 
Under the Bayesian theory, my answer is &#8220;use commitment devices to drive up the weight on the intellectual evidence!&#8221;.
This is suspiciously convenient coming from me, speaking for Beeminder.
</p>
<p>
  But if the answer is the same either way, then what good actually is the Bayesian theory? 
Does it have any practical applications that we don&#8217;t already have with the hyperbolic discounting theory? 
Is it all just a just-so story with neuroscience window dressing?
</p>
<p>
  My claim is that from Beeminder&#8217;s pragmatic perspective all theories of akrasia converge where the rubber meets the road.
Hyperbolic discounting says you over-weight immediate consequences.
The Bayesian theory says you over-weight the evidence from your pure reinforcement learner &#8212; which only cares about immediate consequences.
We can construct other theories.
Take Kahneman&#8217;s &#8220;Thinking Fast and Slow&#8221;: your System 1 takes precedence in your decision-making.
Every conceivable theory (er, that I can conceive of) involves over-weighting immediate consequences in one way or another.

  UPDATE: At this point in the originally published version of this post we went on a fascinating tangent about how Beeminder is all about commitment devices but that really we can generalize that to&#8230;
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/incentalign\\"
    title=\\"Beeminder blog post: Incentive Alignment\\"
  >
    Incentive Alignment
  </a>
  . We liked the point (and the term) so much we decided it should be its own blog post.
But you don&#8217;t need to go off on the tangent now.
The concept of commitment devices is pretty general but it always involves the interplay between short-term and long-term incentives.
Let&#8217;s stay focused on Scott Alexander&#8217;s theory!

<p>
  Scott Alexander&#8217;s description of what&#8217;s going on at the neurological level is fine (unqualified as I am to judge it) but in terms of what it means for motivation hacking, I don&#8217;t see a difference.
Maybe it&#8217;s like how relativity is more correct and general than Newtonian physics but at human-scale Newton suffices.
The Bayesian theory of willpower may be more correct and general than hyperbolic discounting, I&#8217;m not sure, but for all practical motivational purposes they prescribe the same thing.
</p>
<p>
  All that said, if you have any approaches to aligning your own incentives &#8212; upping the weight of your intellectual evidence &#8212; that only make sense in the Bayesian paradigm, I want to hear about them!

    2.x version of the Android App
  </a>
  in the last couple weeks, and we&#8217;re so excited that we just cannot hide it!
Things have improved immensely since we
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/apps\\">
    officially released our smartphone apps

  over a year ago 
and we figured that not only is this latest release
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"

  </a>
  worthy of some considerable fanfare, but also that it would be a good idea to let people know what&#8217;s possible with it.
Because it&#8217;s probably more than you think.
</p>
<h2>
  Improvements and Changelog
</h2>
<p>
  Most importantly, for those who&#8217;ve been using this since the 1.x days, the slowness and frustration and uncertainty about whether it was showing stale info or whether datapoints made it through is gone.
Proper push syncing is implemented so changes usually show up in the app in real time, and when you submit datapoints via the app they show up red until they they make it to the server. 
Just make sure you get your device online once in a while.
</p>
<p>
  We won&#8217;t bore you with the full list of tweaks and fixes but you can see the complete changelog in the app itself &#8212; under Settings &rarr; About Beeminder &rarr; ChangeLog.
It&#8217;s pretty impressive.
And all thanks to

He&#8217;s helped with some of the trickiest graph plotting bits as well, not to mention the Mathematica to Python/Matplotlib port.
Next, of course, is our robot drone army.

<h2>
  Tasker / Submission API
</h2>
<p>
  Possibly the most exciting thing about the Beeminder Android app now, for supernerds anyhow, is that it exposes a submission API to other apps.
This is sweet if you want to build your own custom widnozzle to submit your nozz-whuts to Beeminder.
We&#8217;ve open-sourced our
  <a href=\\"https://github.com/beeminder/beedroid-api\\">
    Beeminder Android API library
  </a>
  &#8212; still rough around the edges.
Let us know if you want to integrate Beeminder into your own app.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">

<p>
  Or if you use
  <a

    title=\\"Tasker is truly amazing. If you have an iPhone then Tasker alone is a reason to go Android.\\"

you can already do this, no programming required.
Tasker is like

    href=\\"http://ifttt.com\\"
    title=\\"IFTTT = If This Then That and is handy for automating sending datapoints to the Beeminder bot, among many other things\\"
  >
    IFTTT
  </a>
  for your Android. 
It exposes triggers and events that you can string together kind of like a recipe. 
It lets you plug in Beeminder as the event portion of a recipe, and so you can do things like automatically mind your sleep based on how long your phone&#8217;s display is off at night, or start a timer every time you launch Candy Crush Saga, and stop and submit the datapoint every time you quit the app. 
Beeminder actions currently appear under the &#8220;Plugin&#8221; section of Tasker&#8217;s task editing screen. 
Beeminder conditions are soon to arrive so you can trigger actions when your goals get within their panic time.
</p>
<p>
  Apart from Tasker, we have an integration with one other Android app, namely, our own
  <a
    href=\\"http://tagti.me\\"
    title=\\"Stochastic self-sampling for space cadets!\\"

    TagTime
  </a>
  .
Every time you answer a TagTime ping, it can send that to Beeminder.
</p>
<h2>
  Manual Data Entry
</h2>
<p>
  We need to figure out how to make this more discoverable but since you&#8217;re reading this we can now tell you:
By swiping at the data entry box, you can use different methods to submit data to Beeminder.
</p>
<p>
  Direct entry
:   This is the default at the bottom of the goal details view. 
    Pro Tip: if you press the date or the value you enter them directly, instead of just using the + / - below them.
</p>
<p>
  Tally entry
:   Swipe the data entry area right (see the narrow yellow rectangles?) and then tap the counter. 
    Now you can increment the count by touching anywhere on the screen. 
    I use this to do
  <a
    href=\\"http://beeminder.com/d/push\\"
    title=\\"Over 13,000 pushups and counting!\\"
  >
    pushups
  </a>
  by putting my phone on the floor and touching my nose to it on each pushup. 
    Use the back button to submit the data.
</p>
<p>
  Timer entry
:   Swipe the data entry area again. Tap to start the timer. Tap again to stop and submit the data. 
    You could use this for tracking time sleeping to Pomodoros to planking. 
    Pro Tip: you don&#8217;t have to stay in the app &#8212; if you leave the timer keeps running, use the notification item to get back to the timer and stop it.
    (Or of course set up a Tasker task to automatically stop it when you, say, leave the house, or put your phone down on its face or whatnot.)
</p>
<p>
  The timer in particular is new, and it is useful for so many things! 
You can track time spent: sleeping, walking, working, cleaning, studying, running errands, and pretty much anything else you can think of.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<h2>
  Widgets
</h2>
<p>
  You can add as many Beeminder widgets as you want to your home screen, showing you what color your goals are and how much more you need to do for each.
When you add a widget to your screen, you can also set a default value for it, so that when pressing on it delivers you to the goal page, the default amount to be entered is pre-filled. 
We think the widgets are pretty great as a sort of personal dashboard, or ambient aweness of the state of your goals.
Seeing a lot of red on your home screen should, rightly, induce some unease, and lots of green means party time.

<h2>
  Other Goodies You May Not Have Noticed
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    You can view the entire list of datapoints, edit, and delete them. Use the menu button (or three stacked dots) in the goal details view.
  </li>
  <li>
    Long press on the goal in the gallery list to skip straight to settings or road dial.

We&#8217;re settling in nicely.

<h2>
  The Road Ahead
</h2>
<p>
  We&#8217;re both hardcore hacker nerds in desperate need of the business-oriented mentoring that Portland Seed Fund has to offer. 
But we&#8217;re committed (
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/blogdog\\"
    title=\\"Note that we recently hit 365 user-visible improvements to Beeminder in 365 days\\"
  >
    quite literally
  </a>
  ) to not letting that distract us from the actual product.
To give that gradual, inexorable progress some direction, here are our high-level goals for the next few months:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Make the goal creation process much friendlier so people find it intuitive to dive in.
There&#8217;s also a mental block many people have about the idea of Beeminder benefiting from failed commitments, which we have
      <a
        href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/faq#qben\\"
        title=\\"Short version: whenever anyone derails and pays a pledge they invariably aver that Beeminder provided more value than they coughed up\\"
      >
        a great counter-argument
      </a>
      for, but that doesn&#8217;t help with people who immediately walk away. 
We&#8217;ve also just started experimenting with subscriptions. 
We have one intrepid user who is paying $12/month to be able to jump to any amount at risk. 
Interestingly, he wasn&#8217;t concerned about paying the lower amounts but he worried that he wouldn&#8217;t reset after his initial failures so he wanted to go straight to the $270 pledge level to keep himself in line from the start. 
We&#8217;re still working on other features to include for premium subscriptions before we roll it out publicly. (Thanks so much to everyone chomping at the bit to get in on this!)
[UPDATE: We&#8217;ve launched
      <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/premium\\">
        premium plans
      </a>
      for real now.]
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Automate emails that we&#8217;re currently sending semi-manually.
We got a good start on that this weekend by
      <a
        href=\\"https://twitter.com/beemuvi/status/176548989137727488\\"

      >
        automating our confirmation emails when someone falls off their yellow brick road
      </a>
      .
We also have work to do on lifecycle emails.
We&#8217;ve been paranoid about being spammy so we&#8217;ve been slow to do this. 
We even have the bot reminder emails automatically decay in frequency until they stop, if you don&#8217;t reply to them.
But with 3800 goals and growing fast [UPDATE 2013: now tens of thousands], we need to get the humans more and more out of the loop.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Publish our API! 
We think this will be huge. 
Mainly we want to make it easy to do with many other companies what we&#8217;ve done so far as a prototype with
      <a href=\\"http://skritter.com\\">
        Skritter.com
      </a>
      &#8212; allow other services to automatically send data to Beeminder on behalf of users to update their graphs. 
So people using Skritter to learn to write Chinese and Japanese can commit to a certain amount of practice per week, without having to enter data into Beeminder separately. 
Of course we already have integration with the
      <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/blind\\">
        Withings scale
      </a>
      and are excited to integrate with a million other devices.
[UPDATE: Our
      <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/api\\">
        API is published
      </a>
      now! And

      !]
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      And of course we have a laundry list of feature requests on our
      <a href=\\"http://uservoice.beeminder.com\\">
        feedback forum
      </a>
      that our users are clamoring for.

She&#8217;s been knocking our socks off since we met her a couple months ago, and apparently the feeling was mutual because last week she moved to Portland from Columbus, Ohio to start with us full-time.
The main excuse to hire her was that she&#8217;ll be running our Beekeeper program, which she&#8217;ll tell you about in this post.
But she&#8217;s pretty brilliant at all manner of other Beeminder work as well.
She&#8217;s been helping with support, keeping on top of evangelism in the blagosphere and whatnot, and drafting blog posts about behavior change.
She clearly fits right in with our general level of behavioral economics nerdery.

  After a year of beta testing with a handful of trials, the Beekeeper program is fully functioning and on a roll now!
Thank you so much to our intrepid beekeeping guinea pigs who put up with us (and especially me) while we learned the ropes, smoothed the sailing, and other nautical metaphors. 
The Beekeeper program was actually conceived a full year before I got involved, starting with an email from a user who just randomly volunteered that they&#8217;d love to pay Beeminder $200/month for some extra hand-holding and accountability.
Danny and Bethany gradually realized how much demand there was for a life-coaching layer on top of Beeminder, and also how much work it takes.
Their overwhelminess was my gain, because they brought me on board and now I have the Awesomest Job Ever

  So if you, or someone you love (or someone you hate but still want to get a useful gift for?) needs a little extra help with actually
  <em>
    accomplishing

  your New Year&#8217;s resolutions, or even figuring out what your resolutions should be, then read on!

<h2>
  What to Expect When You&#8217;re Expecting (A Beekeeper)
</h2>
<p>
  After you sign up,  but  before we meet,
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"OUT1\\"
    href=\\"#OUT\\"
  >
    [2]
  </a>
  I&#8217;ll take a look at your history with Beeminder to find out how long you&#8217;ve been beeminding, what you&#8217;re already beeminding (if anything), and how often you derail.
This is total stalkery, but we&#8217;re going to be talking about your goals, obstacles, shortcomings, hopes, dreams, and whatnot, so we had better be on good terms.
</p>
<p>
  Then, in our first video conference
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"MED1\\"
    href=\\"#MED\\"
  >
    [3]
  </a>
  we&#8217;re going to nail down your goals, and hammer out a game plan, and other construction metaphors. 
(Apply paint to the crumbling façade that is your life? No?) 
Some things we&#8217;ll be discussing include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Do you already know about dialing the yellow brick road, the akrasia horizon, and what the lanes of the road mean?
  </li>
  <li>
    Do you want to focus on productivity or fitness or both?
  </li>
  <li>
    Anything

    are you?
    <em>
      Really

    ?
  </li>
  <li>
    What level of cajoling and handholding do you expect?
  </li>
  <li>
    First-order goals &#8212; do you have them?
  </li>
  <li>
    Are your goals

      title=\\"Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time-bound\\"
    >
      S.M.A.R.T.
    </a>
    ? Can we make them be?
  </li>
  <li>
    What&#8217;s the best way to actually track these goals? Can we turn it into a simple binary? What&#8217;s the optimal way to actually collect the data?
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  One simple litmus test for things that make good Beeminder goals is the
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/wantcanwill\\"
    title=\\"In short, is this goal something you definitely want to do, definitely can do, but historically don&#39;t do? Then it&#39;s perfect for a commitment device like Beeminder.\\"
  >
    want-can-will test
  </a>
  .
We&#8217;ll also look for ways that we can automate data collection for your goals, like with one of our
  <a href=\\"http://beeminder.com/services\\">
    integrations
  </a>
  , e.g.,
  <a
    href=\\"http://rescuetime.com\\"
    title=\\"We love RescueTime and there are a ton of things to beemind based on the data it generates\\"
  >
    RescueTime
  </a>
  , 
and we&#8217;ll help get that set up if you&#8217;re not already using it.
We&#8217;ve also set up custom data collection for people before.
For example one beekeepee changed their email address for iTunes receipts to go to a Beeminder address (
  <em>
    <a href=\\"mailto:theirusername@beeminder.com\\">
      theirusername@beeminder.com
    </a>
  </em>
  )
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"EML1\\"
    href=\\"#EML\\"
  >
    [4]
  </a>
  and then we set up a mail filter and an
  <a href=\\"http://ifttt.com\\">
    IFTTT
  </a>
  recipe to add data to their goal when a receipt came in.
</p>
<p>
  After the first meeting, we will run your goals for about a week, and then do a check-in meeting to see how things are working out, and make any needed changes. 
Most of our beta testers got the most value out of these first couple of meetings so it&#8217;s completely expected that many users will sign up for a single month just to get on the right track. 
The one-month option might also be a great idea for new users who just want a little help getting over Beeminder&#8217;s initial learning curve.
</p>
<p>
  Besides the video conferencing, other perqs you might want to take advantage of include:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Shielding you from data entry or the mechanics of beeminding (like dialing your roads)
  </li>
  <li>
    Being more persistent about reminders than the Beeminder bot can be (if the bot tries to be more persistent it backfires since you tune it out)
  </li>

That&#8217;s right folks! Beeminder hired a whole brand sparkling new employee specifically for this program. 
In fact, I&#8217;m the first official full-time employee. 
I moved all they way from Columbus, Ohio to come join Beeminder here in the [hipster paradise that is Portland](http://www.ifc.com/portlandia/videos/portlandia-portland-dream-of-the-90s &#8220;The Dream of the 90s is alive in Portland&#8221;).
I am trying to grow some facial hair to better fit in, but seem to be having trouble with it, because of this extra X chromosome.

  Besides that, here are some things I think are especially nifty: effective altruism, swing dancing, social psychology, cognitive biases, moral psychology, Joss Whedon, Neil Gaiman, Mumford and Sons, eurogames that take way too long to play, and the people who play said games, thinking probabilistically, game theory, behavioral economics, community building, intentional relationships, space and the things found therein and the exploration thereof, horror movies, the usual nerdery (BSG, Dr Who, Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, etc).

  This is an interesting little Beekeeper perq. 
It&#8217;s an accountability email address, minded by someone in charge of keeping you on track on your goals.
You can use the email address as your own, with the caveat that your beekeeper will also see everything sent to it. 
There are a lot of interesting things you could do with it, by setting up email filters. 
As a silly example
  <a href=\\"http://stickk.com\\">

    wrote about Complice
  </a>
  on the blog? 
We described how nicely Beeminder and Complice complement each other for different goals and different aspects of goals, and described the new ways Complice could automatically send data to Beeminder.
Well a lot has changed since then (thanks to extensive use of Beeminder and Complice, of course) and today we&#8217;re excited and proud to announce the
  <em>
    official
  </em>
  Beeminder+Complice integration.
You know it&#8217;s the real deal because there&#8217;s an

And there&#8217;s a super handy Beeminder widget for the Today page:

<p>
  This is nice because Complice is designed to be the app you hang out in all day while being productive.
It&#8217;s your productivity dashboard, complete with pomodoro timer and co-working rooms.
So having a Beeminder widget right there on the today page makes it easy to pay attention to the commitments that Beeminder is enforcing, without having to leave your productivity home.
</p>
<p>
  Other things that are new since the November blog post include automatically beeminding the percentage of outcomes you complete each day
and beeminding your presence in co-working rooms. 
Especially

  Finally, we should apologize for taking so long to announce all this, as it&#8217;s been live for a month.
On the bright side, that&#8217;s been enough time to collect a few real-life, honest-to-god, we&#8217;re-not-making-these-up (and written by nary a one of our mothers) testimonials, which we&#8217;ll now quote:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    &#8220;All the new Beeminder-features are amazing! I can practically stop loading the Beeminder page completely and just use the service through Complice. Makes it so much harder to miss a Beeminder goal. Very nice!&#8221;
  </li>
  <li>
    &#8220;This is amaaaazing! The little Beeminder dashboard on the home page is also absolutely amazing. So useful &#8212; now I can see all my tasks and goals in one place.&#8221;
  </li>
  <li>
    &#8220;Effectively, Complice + Beeminder has given me the ability to start putting my life back together. So, thank you for that.&#8221;

  Beeminder has existed in some form since February of 2008, when we made a rather ad hoc tool for a friend to track her weight.
The main feature was automated reminders to reply with your number each day, so we called it Kibotzer, the kibitzing robot.
We described it like so:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    <b>
      Kibitzer
    </b>
    , noun: Someone who chimes in with not necessarily wanted advice.
    <br>
    <code>
      +
    </code>
    <b>
      Bot
    </b>
    , noun: A machine or program that interacts with you in a vaguely human way.
    <br>
    <code>
      =
    </code>
    <b>
      Kibotzer
    </b>
    : A bot that bugs you about how fat you are.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  In 2010 we decided to get serious about this as an actual startup and decided we needed a new name.
Too few people knew how to pronounce &#8220;kibotzer&#8221; or knew what &#8220;kibitzing&#8221; was.
[UPDATE 2017: Here&#8217;s the

our friend, Michael J.J. Tiffany,
spared us further agonizing by suggesting &#8220;Beeminder&#8221; (and buying the domain just in case we liked it; thanks Michael!).
</p>
<p>
  How do we love the name &#8220;Beeminder&#8221;? Let us count the ways:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Beeminder is a &#8220;me-binder&#8221; &#8212; a
    <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/akrasia\\">
      self-binding
    </a>
    tool.
  </li>
  <li>
    &#8220;Beeminder&#8221; rhymes with &#8220;reminder&#8221;.
  </li>
  <li>
    It&#8217;s about &#8220;minding your goals&#8221; in the &#8220;mind your p&#8217;s and q&#8217;s&#8221; sense. (&#8220;Bee-mindful&#8221;)

    Our esteemed co-founder
    <a href=\\"http://bethaknee.com\\">
      Bethany Soule
    </a>
    goes by &#8220;Bee&#8221;.
  </li>
  <li>
    Bees are just cute (and hard-working!).
  </li>
  <li>
    Beeminder sends reminders with a motivational sting. (Thanks to

    Beeminder helps you make a beeline for your goal.

  <li>
    You use Beeminder because you want to be minded.

    Beeminder is sort of a generalization of Sobriety Minders,

      which are a real thing

Here&#8217;s how the names &#8220;Kibotzer&#8221; and &#8220;Beeminder&#8221; fare by my naming criteria:
</p>
<center title=\\"Kibotzer (emphasis on the syllable 'bot', which many people didn't realize) was a kibitzing robot and the verb was 'to kibotz on' something\\">

</center>
<p>
  (The more backfitted explanations for the name we come up with the more I feel like &#8220;Beeminder&#8221; deserves a green light on Evocativity.
And we have &#8220;BMNDR&#8221; &#8212; both as a

So we&#8217;re pretty darn pleased with our name!)

  and it is an eep day and I still don&#8217;t feel like running, I can decide to pay $10 and get out of it. 
Cool! 
I&#8217;m no longer badgering myself about how I &#8220;should&#8221; go, or about how I&#8217;m going rogue on past me who decided that the optimal time to run would be tomorrow.

<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">

<p>
  Instead it&#8217;s a simple decision: how much do I value
  <em>
    not running
  </em>
  right now? 
If it is less than $10 then I&#8217;ll run. 
If it is more, I&#8217;ll pay. 
If I get up to $90 pledged and I still don&#8217;t want to go running, then I will re-evaluate why I am trying to get myself to run in the first place.

  If it is a really good reason, then OK, let the amounts continue upward.
Sometimes, however, I might realize that this goal is stupid and I don&#8217;t want it anyway.
Then I can just hit Archive.

  Ideally beeminding stuff isn&#8217;t just another punishment you heap on to an already critical inner monologue. 
Allow us to ease that burden.

  on Beeminder and elsewhere.
I&#8217;m a fairly regular middle class nerd. 
Early 30s. 
An engineering job in some corporate niche. 
A family. 
By many metrics I’m doing well: 
I’m basically healthy, I make a good living, I’m lucky enough to live in politically stable times (by Central European standards), and I face no immediate crises in my life. 
You can say all is well &#8212; or, depending on your perspective, that I’m coasting, and I’m ready to level up my game, but only if I could break out of my current routine, which is filled with  full-time employment, children, housework, and related responsibilities.
</p>
<p>
  So I made a Beeminder goal to do just that.
</p>
<p>
  The original fine print read:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    85% of the time I will do daily planning in the morning. 
To mark this goal as done I will list at least one and at most three concrete actionable tasks to do over the day. 
The list will be recorded in writing [&#8230;] by 10:00 local time.
I will track how many of those tasks I actually completed, but that&#8217;s outside the scope of this Beeminder goal.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  I decided to leave out of the fine print any specific definition of what type of tasks I&#8217;d write down. 
I just had this general and intentionally vague idea that I should go beyond my usual routine.
</p>
<p>
  So I planned for  the
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/tkadlubo/goals/plan\\"
    title=\\"The goal is now finished and archived\\"
  >
    Beeminder goal
  </a>
  to last for 2 months and it&#8217;s now completed. 
Let&#8217;s see how it went in raw numbers. 
On average I planned some 1.4 tasks per day. 
I completed 45 tasks, which is less than 60% of the total planned. 
I had hoped for a higher percentage, but that was explicitly not the focus of the goal. 
No derailments, although I was surfing the red edge of the Yellow Brick Road most of the time, which is how I roll with Beeminder.
</p>

  But did it work?
</h2>

  &#8220;I was surfing the red edge of the Yellow Brick Road most of the time, which is how I roll with Beeminder&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  The goal was meant to generally shake up my routine &#8212; and it did. 
This overall objective was achieved. 
The format worked well. 
Writing tasks down helped keep it real. 
Keeping it to at most 3 items a day made me feel the opposite of overwhelmed. 
It was the first Beeminder goal for which I asked a friend (and fellow Beeminder user) to be my

She consulted with me on the initial fine print and I occasionally shared progress updates with her.

<h2>
  What didn&#8217;t work
</h2>
<p>
  The biggest mistake was choosing 10:00 in the morning for the deadline, as you can&#8217;t set it in the Beeminder system. 
The Beeminder software explicitly disallows 6am to noon to avoid having to distinguish night owls from early birds.
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"

  </a>
  As a result I couldn&#8217;t rely on the Beeminder Android app reminders. 
My plans about when to physically think about the tasks and write them down didn&#8217;t work at all.
</p>
<p>
  An additional, though minor, problem with this goal was that there was no reason to make it two months long. 
I learned everything there was to learn from this experiment during the first month. 
If you are tempted to try this, I believe a faster iteration would work just as well.

  For almost a year now I&#8217;ve been a happy Beeminder user. 
It helps me accomplish goals that I otherwise probably would not achieve, like doing a short daily workout, practicing some Spanish, or even keeping my blog alive with content.
I had planned for today&#8217;s post to be about my blogging workflow, which heavily depends on Beeminder. 
Alas, today&#8217;s post is a different story.
</p>
<h2>
  About dog food
</h2>
<p>
  Let me give you a little background.
What I love about Beeminder is their
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.fogcreek.com/dogfooding-until-it-hurts/\\"
    title=\\"Note last paragraph about Beeminder\\"
  >
    extensive
  </a>
  belief in dog food. 
Dog food in the sense of product development where you use your own product (in production, no less) from a very early point during development on. 
Beeminder has taken that to the next level, because they use Beeminder to improve the product. 
There is a
  <a href=\\"https://beeminder.com/meta/uvi\\">
    meta Beeminder goal
  </a>
  where the team promises to implement and roll out (and tweet about!) one &#8220;User-Visible Improvement&#8221; every day. 
Should they fall off the wagon (derail, in Beeminder
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/glossary\\"
    title=\\"Yes, they have a whole glossary for their jargon\\"

  </a>
  ) the pledge goes to a lucky blog reader (or commenter, technically). 
With this scheme, the team managed over
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/uvi/\\">
    1000
  </a>
  UVIs over the last three years! 
Pretty awesome, if you ask me. 
In the process though, due to some derailments, the pledge slowly grew to $1000.
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"COR1\\"
    href=\\"#COR\\"
  >
    [1]
  </a>
  And yes, all previous pledges were paid to Beeminder blog readers.
</p>
<h2>
  Close, but no cigar
</h2>
<p>
  So, the UVI pledge looms at $1000. 
Believe it or not, I have far better things to do than checking the UVI chart on a daily basis. 
But once in a while, after checking that my own charts are all green, I wander over to the meta goals. 
November 19th was such a day, and lo and behold, the team was very close to derailing, which I noticed shortly before going to bed. 
As time zones happen, the deadline (midnight PT) is a convenient 9am for me, so I set an alarm for the next day to check the goal again, only to find out that they managed to get a UVI rolled out and tweeted about. 
After a quick exchange on Twitter I went on with my day and more or less forgot about it. 
And in the following days the Beeminder team managed to stay on the road, all the way up to 1000 UVIs and more.
</p>

Also, funny story from @dreev: I actually remember feeling very slightly guilty about that tweet, encouraging Henrik to potentially lose sleep checking our meta graphs, because I was 99.9% confident that we'd pull off a UVI in time.

<p>
  On December 3rd, a couple hours after 9am (CET) I came across the UVI meta goal again, and to my surprise it was off the road, and to my further surprise, no one had claimed it by commenting on the blog post. 
Which I did, immediately. 
And Daniel responded some minutes later, saying that it seemed to be legit, even though they actually had a UVI rolled out, just not tweeted about in time.

  , 
I wasn&#8217;t 100% sure that I&#8217;d actually get paid by Beeminder. 
But I had other things going on (like work) and it was night time at Beeminder HQ anyways. 
Turns out, when I was asleep the next night, Daniel contacted me on pretty much all available channels to figure out how to pay me. 
After a few emails back and forth in the morning I received the confirmation from PayPal that I had a payment of $1000 in my account. Wow.
</p>
<h2>
  Own vs. Earn
</h2>
<p>
  What to do with a windfall of $960 (yes, some $40 were lost due to PayPal&#8217;s transaction fees), shortly before Christmas? 
There are a couple of gadgets I&#8217;ve been eyeing for the last few months. 
The Garmin FR620, for one, coming in at $400. 
A GoPro Hero 3, another $400. 
That would still leave me with more than $150 to spend. 
But somehow that didn&#8217;t feel right. 
If I own gadgets, I want to have earned them, knowing that I worked for it.
</p>
<p>
  Then how about getting rid of that slight overdraft, that crept up over the summer? 
That would make me reach my

    &#8220;Pay back overdraft&#8221;
  </a>
  Beeminder goal pretty quickly.
Still, feels wrong.
</p>
<p>
  Honestly, these two thoughts on how to spend the money went as quickly as they entered my head. 
I knew what I&#8217;d do with the money even before I posted my comment on the Beeminder blog.

</p>
<p>
  To cut a long story short, I made a donation of $938 for the WBR, thus giving seven bicycles to people in Zambia, courtesy of Beeminder. 
However, since this counts towards the &#8220;Grand Slam&#8221;, Fatty&#8217;s anonymous donor will match those seven bicycles and make it 14. 
Here&#8217;s the confirmation email:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Dear Henrik,

    &nbsp;
    <br>
    On behalf of World Bicycle Relief and the people we serve, please accept my sincere appreciation for your generous donation of $938.00.

    World Bicycle Relief’s mission is to provide access to independence and livelihood through the Power of Bicycles; your gift helps mobilize people across rural Sub-Saharan Africa with simple, sustainable bicycle transportation. Your generosity helps connect children with schools, healthcare workers with patients and entrepreneurs with markets.

<p>
  Now, should I, by any chance, win one of the bikes that Fatty organised as an incentive for his fundraiser, I&#8217;m totally going to keep it.

  I would like to thank the Beeminder team for an awesome product and the courage to live up to their slip-ups each and every time.

<p>
  Many people, including me, have tried many ways to lose weight. 
Sometimes we have success, sometimes not. 
Beeminder is a powerful tool for many kinds of goals, but while beeminding weight is a very common goal, I don’t think it’s a very effective one.
</p>
<p>
  A few
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/whattomind/\\"
    title=\\"TODO\\"
  >
    guidelines
  </a>
  for effective Beeminder goals are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Inputs, not outcomes: beemind your effort, not the results (e.g., guitar practice sessions, not songs learned)
  </li>
  <li>
    Good metrics make better graphs (miles run, not running sessions)
  </li>
  <li>
    Automate wherever possible
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  But weight is not a great fit here. 
First, it’s perhaps the best example of a “result”, that you don’t control directly. 
It’s also extremely noisy &#8212; drink some water, gain a pound.
When you&#8217;re tracking weight directly, it’s easy to talk yourself into an extra snack. 
“I’m sure it’ll be fine.”
</p>
<p>
  At least you can get a Fitbit or Nokia (formerly Withings) smart scale and have it automatically send your weight to Beeminder. 
It also makes a nice metric, and an interesting graph. 
But directly setting a downward slope for weight does not make a very effective Beeminder goal.
</p>
<h3>
  Finding an “Input” to Track
</h3>
<p>
  Counting calories? 
That was a non-starter for me due to my personal circumstances.
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"GOOG1\\"
    href=\\"#GOOG\\"
  >
    [1]
  </a>
  I don&#8217;t prepare most of my food, and so the technique of using nutrition labels to count calories in bulk doesn&#8217;t work either.
</p>
<p>
  More broadly, if you’ve ever tried to count calories, you know it’s exceedingly tedious. 
There&#8217;s a lot of estimation, too. 
Did you eat 2/3rds of the bowl? 
Or was it closer to 3/4s?
So there&#8217;s the nagging suspicion that the calorie totals aren&#8217;t very accurate, undercutting the purpose.
</p>
<p>
  What’s needed is an input that’s less tedious, and robust when you don’t know the exact calorie totals.
</p>
<h3>
  Counting Bites
</h3>
<p>
  There was an old Beeminder forum post that suggested counting bites of food as a proxy for calories.
That is, counting each forkful, or each bite of a sandwich.
This is much closer to an effective goal &#8212; it’s an input I have direct control over.
</p>
<p>
  I started tracking bites right away without trying to change my habits. 
I found I was eating 105 to 115 bites a day.
Aiming to lose weight, I set my yellow brick road at about 3/4s of that: 80 bites a day. 
I found that amount worked for me: I was losing weight and wasn&#8217;t hungry.
I lost 40 pounds in less than 6 months, and have held it off for three years and counting, using this technique.
</p>
<p>
  There are a lot of details and lessons learned that are worth mentioning here.
</p>
<h3>
  Description
</h3>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;I lost 40 pounds while eating bacon, cookies, and blueberry-topped pancakes.&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  First, let me make this concrete. 
I’m male, 5’9” (176cm), medium build.
My weight had been creeping slowly up for years, and I was 205 pounds (93kg) when I started counting bites.
</p>
<p>
  At 80 bites per day, I lost 15 pounds in 8 weeks. 
That’s pretty fast; some authorities suggest a maximum pace of losing 1% of your weight per week. 
I found that the pace slowed as I lost weight (and therefore my calorie needs dropped), until I reached 165 pounds at around 5 months.
</p>
<h3>
  Diet
</h3>
<p>
  The quality of one’s diet is a very different question from total calorie intake. 
My diet was of poor quality before, during and after losing this weight. 
I could improve my health by choosing healthier foods, but that’s a separate question that calls, perhaps, for different Beeminder goals.
</p>
<h3>
  Dieting
</h3>
<p>
  Most diet plans these days involve cutting some class of foods from your diet altogether. 
Usually carbs, but also meat, gluten and a hundred more subsets. 
Those techniques also bring success to some people, but I find them frustrating and painful.
</p>
<p>
  The deal I cut with myself was: 
I get X bites per day, but I can spend them however I want. 
In practice, I didn’t change my diet significantly, just reduced the total. 
So I lost 40 pounds while eating bacon, cookies, and blueberry-topped pancakes. 
To my mind, getting to eat tasty things is a feature, not a bug.
</p>
<h3>
  Density
</h3>
<p>
  A bite of salad is larger than a bite of cake. 
You’re aiming to get a roughly equal amount of calories into each bite, but don’t sweat the precision too much. 
It all averages out in the end.
</p>
<h3>
  Daily Limits
</h3>
<p>
  How many bites do you eat in a day? 
I doubt you have a firm idea. 
I certainly didn’t. 
I set a generous limit of 200 bites and simply tracked it for a couple of weeks. 
Turned out I was eating 105 to 115 bites a day. 
So I set the limit at 80. 
You may find that different totals work better for you. 
I actually found that 80 was perhaps losing weight too fast, at first. 
But the pace slowed down as my weight fell, and now 90 bites is what I use for holding steady around 170 pounds.
</p>
<h3>
  Discipline, or How Big is a Bite?
</h3>
<p>
  Your akratic, in-the-moment self is the one who wants another cookie, but you-in-the-large who wants to lose weight is setting the daily limit. 
If you can’t stop yourself in the moment from counting an entire cookie as 1 bite because it fits in your mouth, that’s fine: 
just set the daily total to 20 or something instead. 
Keep ratcheting it tighter until you’re losing weight!
</p>
<h3>
  Drinking
</h3>
<p>
  That’s fine for food, but how big is a “bite” of beer? 
My solution to this was to work out an estimated calorie total of about 1600 for my 80 bites, yielding a pleasant 20 calories per bite. 
That gives the exchange rate for drinks and other things that are hard to measure in bites.
</p>
<p>
  This is the only part of my diet that changed significantly. 
I like beer and wine, but they cost a lot of bites!
I found I preferred a cookie to a beer, most of the time.
After counting bites for so long, the only three things I drink routinely are 
water (free), 
black coffee (1 or 2 calories a cup, so effectively free) and 
scotch (definitely not free, but easy to measure and count).
</p>
<h3>
  Dressing and Toppings
</h3>
<p>
  This is a general problem with calorie counting and dieting: hidden extras. 
Salads are nice and healthy, but feta cheese and ranch dressing are worth lots of bites. 
Maybe more than you’d like to spend.
</p>
<p>
  Sugar in coffee is modest, and milk is not bad, but cream is a lot of bites. 
Don’t discount that latte! 
Barbecue sauce, mayonnaise and ketchup are surprisingly substantial. 
(Use Sriracha hot sauce instead &#8212; it’s delicious and you use a lot less.)
</p>
<p>
  For drinks like coffee, work out the calories and convert. 
For salads and condiments, I just keep that in mind when estimating how big a bite should be.
</p>
<h3>
  Day to Day
</h3>
<p>
  The Beeminder app for Android has a tap input mode
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"TAP1\\"
    href=\\"#TAP\\"
  >
    [2]
  </a>
  that’s ideal for this. 
Most of the screen becomes a touch area that counts up with each tap. 
I leave my phone on the table and tap it with the back of a knuckle as I eat. 
I found it easy to build that habit.
</p>
<p>
  There&#8217;s a big difference between using your phone during a meal, and letting it sit flat on the table showing the count.
I really dislike using phones during a meal, but this never seemed rude or distracting.
It&#8217;s actually a talking point &#8212; people were curious what I was counting.
</p>
<p>
  I also find during the day that I tend to piously start counting small, conservative bites. 
Then later in the day, I’m cheating a little and counting 2 or 3 oversized bites in order to finish the last of something. 
That’s fine &#8212; the beauty of this scheme is that you allow for these kinds of variations by adjusting the road.
</p>
<h3>
  Decisions
</h3>
<p>
  Really what this does is force you to choose what to spend your bites on, especially the last handful. 
I could have a slice of pie, or seconds on dinner, but not both. 
Or do I want a double bourbon later in the evening instead?
</p>
<p>
  Planning ahead helps a lot too. 
I was only hungry at night once, when I used up a whole day’s bites before 3pm and had nothing to eat in the evening. 
If I know I&#8217;m going to that delicious barbecue place on Thursday, I&#8217;ll have a light lunch that day. 
The holidays are coming (and so is Thanksgiving, Americans) so better start building up some extra safety buffer in the days leading up to the big feast!
</p>
<h3>
  Disclaimer
</h3>
<p>
  I’m not a doctor, nor trained in any kind of nutrition or medicine. 
I’m a software engineer, and one with a bad diet who would totally be overweight (again) if left to myself. 
Be careful with your health. 
This scheme works great for me, but your mileage may vary.

Swipe the input portion at the bottom of the goal screen. 
There are three modes: direct entry with comment, tap counting, and timer.

  recently told us about a failed attempt to proselytize Beeminder.
The person he recommended it to said they knew about Beeminder and viewed it as self-blackmail. 
That it degrades trust in your future self. 
They advocated behavior change by bringing your present self and future self into more direct alignment, with no threat of punishment.
</p>
<p>
  I&#8217;m practically bursting with responses to that, from a footnote in our very first blog post
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/akrasia/#sel\\"
    title=\\"Here&#39;s the footnote: Although I’m using the multiple selves terminology, I view it as no more than a rhetorical device. There are not multiple selves in any real sense. Rather, as I will argue, there’s in fact just one true you whose decision-making is sometimes distorted in the presence of immediate consequences, which act like a drug. Which is to say (as an empirical fact) that when a decision involves some consequences that are immediate and some that are distant, humans irrationally (no amount of future discounting can account for it) over-weight the immediate consequences. So I refer to multiple selves but I believe there is one true self: the one not under the influence of immediate consequences.\\"

  Parrhesia again:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    If a Beeminder goal is making you feel sad or oppressed or anything you can remove it [after a one-week delay of course]. 
What Beeminder does is put a barrier between extremely short-term thinking and long-term thinking. 
That way your deeper values and behavior can align better. 
So it&#8217;s ironically the opposite of what the self-blackmail accusation worries about.

  Somewhere around here we went off on a tangent about whether a having a sense of thirst counts as internal self-coercion getting you to drink.
It was a fun discussion of our various idiosyncrasies.
The conclusion: sometimes our physical drives are misaligned with our true goals, film at 11.
But the point is, sometimes we can fix that misalignment by creating additional external drives and if that works, that&#8217;s great.

<blockquote>
  <p>
    The entire reason Beeminder exists is that there is a gap between what higher-you wants, and what in-the-moment you wants. 
I&#8217;m actively choosing to give higher-me more control over in-the-moment me. 
I love &#8220;in-the-moment&#8221; me, he&#8217;s the one that actually has to show up and do all the work and gold star buddy&#8230; you&#8217;ve done some good stuff over the years. 
But he could certainly use some help. 
Whether that&#8217;s Beeminder, shaping the environment, scheduling a focused block of time, it doesn&#8217;t really matter. 
The point is to just set that guy up for success.
    <br>
    &nbsp;
    <br>
    I&#8217;d invite people who have an issue with Beeminder to see your higher self as a loving benevolent guide creating carrots and sticks so that the two of you (higher and in-the-moment) can succeed together.

  Of course I do worry I&#8217;m in an echo chamber here and want to make sure I really understand the anti-Beeminder case.
I&#8217;ve heard it in a couple parts of the rationality-sphere.

  spends a good part of an hour talking about why self-coercive techniques like Beeminder are no good.
(Though when Beeminder is mentioned specifically they kindly point out that they see plenty of use of it that doesn&#8217;t count as particularly self-coercive.)
Similarly, Nate Soares&#8217;s

    self-blackmail debate
  </a>
  in the Beeminder forum about a rationality-adjacent blogger arguing against Beeminder on similar grounds.
My challenge to the nay-sayers is to make the alternative to Beeminder more concrete.
How, beyond giving yourself motivational speeches, do you bring your short-term and long-term selves into alignment?
And maybe also get specific about what&#8217;s so bad, psychologically speaking, about creating constraints for yourself.
Many of us do so in a way that doesn&#8217;t feel coercive at all. 
Others embrace the self-coercion and feel it&#8217;s worth it.

The idea with STEPN is that you ante some hundreds of dollars (this involves buying an NFT of a shoe?) and then get paid some fractions of cents (depending on what their cryptocurrency is trading at) for every step you take.
Granted we are very old and uncool but we find this all semi-excruciating.

    Beeminder&#8217;s old competitor, Pact
  </a>
  .
CommitPool&#8217;s point is that you can&#8217;t trust apps like this, ergo trustlessness.
</p>
<p>
  (If you&#8217;re not up on cryptocurrency concepts, that&#8217;s a key selling point of decentralized protocols: not having to trust any single entity, and being robust to attempts, even by governments, to shut the thing down.)
</p>
<p>
  In the case of Pact, the FTC shut them down because too many users complained that they couldn&#8217;t get refunds.
A user would get charged money for missing a workout but it was just that the user had a bad internet connection or something and the workout didn&#8217;t get reported.
This is an ironic thing for CommitPool to point to because that&#8217;s exactly the kind of thing that a CommitPool user would be entirely out of luck on with a commitment contract implemented as a smart contract.
</p>
<p>
  Of course anyone opting in to a &#8220;smart&#8221; commitment contract has their eyes wide open that there&#8217;s no one to appeal to if they don&#8217;t think they should&#8217;ve actually been charged.
But that&#8217;s the irony: the FTC article about how many unhappy users Pact had is a case in point for centralization if anything!
</p>
<p>
  We&#8217;re avoiding Pact&#8217;s problems by scaling up very gradually so if a user has a problem, they will definitely be able to talk to a human workerbee about it.
These are problems like &#8220;I got charged money for missing my workout because my phone&#8217;s battery died and didn&#8217;t record the workout&#8221;. 
Beeminder makes sure not to charge you in such cases and CommitPool absolutely would. 
The code is the law, etc. 
Which has advantages!
</p>
<p>
  In fact, we recently introduced a
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/noexcuses/\\"
    title=\\"Beeminder blog post introducing No-Excuses Mode\\"
  >
    No-Excuses Mode
  </a>
  because  we kind of like the code-is-law mentality and think the most impressive Beeminder users are keen to opt in to that. 
But this is not us conceding any points in the debate.
We can have best of both worlds with our approach.
</p>
<p>
  Here&#8217;s CommitPool&#8217;s response:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Issues/mistakes like phone batteries dying will always exist. 
As we see it, there are two ways to deal with them:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Allow users to appeal missed commitments
    </li>
    <li>
      Encourage users to give themselves a buffer by under-committing
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Approach #1 takes care of the mistakes problem, but only at the high cost of undermining the core value prop of a commitment by introducing a vector for users to cheat.
And any user that cheats isn&#8217;t getting what they want out of the product: they&#8217;re just cheating themselves.
Approach #2 has similar issues, at least on its face: under-commitments lead to users reaching their commitments early, which removes the incentive to complete the rest of their actual goal.
But can we re-add that incentive? Yes, and again there are two paths.
  </p>
  <p>
    Path A (the weaker form) is to create an incentive to &#8220;get ahead&#8221; by have rolling commitments. 
This is roughly what Beeminder does, and we like it quite a bit!
But we call it the weaker form because eventually the user is far enough ahead to relax and the incentive goes away again.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  (Astute point from CommitPool! 
We have a feature called
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/glossary/#ratchet\\"
    title=\\"Beeminder glossary entry. Yes, Beeminder has a glossary.\\"
  >
    ratcheting
  </a>
  that lets you get rid of excess safety buffer.)
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Path B is to introduce a
    <em>
      positive
    </em>
    incentive correlated with the percentage of the goal the user achieves.
The best way to do this is with a pooled model, where money lost by users who fail is split among users who succeed as a reward.
This is what CommitPool is building towards, and it is most effective in a decentralized context.
Why?
As Pact found out, adding a reward is one hell of a growth drug. 
Best to prevent yourself from even accidentally cheating your users by giving up control.
Rewards also attract people who are inclined to cheat, so it&#8217;s important to ensure that users have no vectors for cheating.
Decentralized activity reporting is just as crucial as decentralized incentive execution.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  CommitPool is hitting plenty of nails on the head here. 
We talk about the adverse selection problem in
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/gympact/\\"
    title=\\"From 2012, not to be confused with our 2017 post from when Pact died\\"
  >
    an ancient blog post from when Pact was new
  </a>
  .
As for the question of cheating, we have
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/cheating/\\"
    title=\\"From 2013 but as relevant as ever\\"
  >
    thoughts on that as well
  </a>
  .
</p>
<p>
  But the crux is trust and decentralization, according to CommitPool, like a centralized entity accidentally cheating its users.
CommitPool&#8217;s smart contracts require no trust &#8212; at least in the way that Pact did &#8212; because there&#8217;s no such thing as appeals or refunds.
But that&#8217;s easy.
Beeminder could also, hypothetically, just say &#8220;no appeals&#8221; and make that crystal clear as part of signing up and then, what possible accidental cheating of users could we do?
I mean, we don&#8217;t say &#8220;no appeals&#8221; and so being able to appeal is in fact part of the agreement and so we could, hypothetically, accidentally cheat our users by failing to keep up with the appeals.
But it doesn&#8217;t require decentralization to fix that. 
It requires taking the possibility of appeals off the table.
</p>
<p>
  It turns out CommitPool actually does hope to support appeals.
They envision &#8220;a decentralized appeals process where the community decides if a given user should be forgiven.&#8221;
This may be our lack of imagination but we don&#8217;t think that will work at all.
It&#8217;s far too much friction to have a committee make decisions like that.
But the proof will be in the pudding and we&#8217;ll be fascinated to be proven wrong on this.
</p>
<p>
  At this point the debate turned to the question of verification that you&#8217;re doing what you committed to.
</p>
<p>
  I believe that CommitPool is kind of hitting a brick wall on this.
Their goal, they say, is to 100% relinquish control of their data source for your steps.
That&#8217;s just Strava currently, for CommitPool, but it could be any wearable gadget like Fitbit or Garmin &#8212; Beeminder integrates with all of these.
</p>
<p>
  But (a) how does CommitPool relinquish that control? and (b) even if they do, what good does that do?
If it&#8217;s about the user cheating, there&#8217;s ultimately no way to prevent that.
You can always put your Fitbit on your dog and CommitPool and Beeminder can&#8217;t tell the difference.
Similarly, there&#8217;s no way to fully eliminate the need to trust some central entity in the chain that starts with you taking steps to your gadget recording those steps to the steps getting recorded on a blockchain to the smart contract paying out.
</p>
<p>
  The blockchain&#8217;s trustlessness and code-is-law-ness only applies to the last step, once your steps are recorded on the blockchain.
</p>
<p>
  In any case, we didn&#8217;t go down that rabbit hole in the actual debate because it&#8217;s currently moot.
CommitPool is currently just as centralized as Beeminder in this regard, having full control of the link between the data on Strava and your money.
(This is a common
  <a
    href=\\"https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html\\"
    title=\\"Eye-opening blog post by Moxie Marlinspike, old-school crypto (as in cryptography) expert and founder of Signal, about how blockchains and NFTs and such end up de facto centralized\\"
  >
    disparity between the theory and practice of web3
  </a>
  .)
</p>
<p>
  We agreed to pause the debate until CommitPool has implemented its decentralization vision to the point that users are less susceptible to CommitPool going rogue than they are to Beeminder going rogue.
Because currently that susceptibility is identical, not that either of us are likely to go rogue!

  Half a year ago, with Beeminder in its infancy, we

    committed to averaging one User-Visible Improvement (UVI) to Beeminder every day

  Fine print: The first person to leave a comment here outing us as officially off the yellow brick road, gets the money.
If there’s a red dot below the road that means we have until midnight eastern that night to reach the bottom edge or we cough it up.
The usual Beeminder rules apply: any changes are allowed as long as they are outside the
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/dial\\">
    Akrasia Horizon
  </a>
  of one week.
The money shown as &#8220;pledged&#8221; is the amount you&#8217;ll win.
This varies among the above graphs.
</p>
<p>
  UPDATE 2012: 
After a ridiculous close call, we&#8217;re updating the fine print!
We were in Portland on an emergency UVI day, did the UVI, then had to run off to various Important Things all day.
We got back around 9pm, which OMG! is midnight eastern time!
And we hadn&#8217;t yet tweeted the UVI!
So there were some number of minutes when you totally could&#8217;ve called us out on that $1000.
(And, for the record, we were absolutely ready to pay it if you had.)
We like having stricter rules for these dog food contracts, but from now on let&#8217;s keep it more in line with the rules you all are subject to:
you have to wait for the actual skull and crossbones on the graph to claim the money.
And we have till midnight local time, wherever we happen to be, to actually get the work done.
It&#8217;s too easy to forget about time zone differences otherwise.
</p>
<p>
  UPDATE 2013:
You don&#8217;t have to wait for skull and crossbones anymore, since those are

Is this thing on?
</p>
<p>
  This is our first official post on our shiny new WordPress-free blog.
Confetti-emoji!
</p>
<p>
  For well over a decade the Beeminder blog was on WordPress, hosted by WP Engine. 
That was&#8230; mostly fine? 
WP Engine did a good job of keeping us from having to think about maintenance much. 
But it was quite pricey
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"PRICE1\\"
    href=\\"#PRICE\\"
  >
    [1]
  </a>
  and I was never a fan of WordPress. 
It&#8217;s slow and overcomplicated and clunky; I&#8217;m in a fight with it for various silly reasons.
</p>
<p>
  So
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.nathanarthur.com/\\"
    title=\\"Nathan&#39;s personal homepage\\"

    Nathan Arthur
  </a>
  had the idea that moving us to a static site generator would be a simple project that would save money in the long run. 
Predictably it wasn&#8217;t quite as simple as we, um, predicted.
Stay tuned for an X-Treme Nerd Interlude post from Nathan!
But it was super fun and the new blog is a big quality-of-life improvement for me. 
As much of the Beeminder community knows, narthur, as we call him online, is a joy to work with. 
He&#8217;s responsible for all sorts of great things in the Beeminder ecosystem 
(the community Discord,

plus of course he founded the friendly Beeminder competitor/complement,

</p>
<p>
  So what&#8217;s powering the blog now? 
Mainly a static site generator called Astro. 
Static site generator meaning that we have our blog posts as markdown files and Astro, plus various Node.js tools, turns those files into a bunch of static HTML and CSS that is served to your browser from the cloud hosting provider Render.com. 
All the code for this is public at

It sounds like that should be a simple thing to beemind. 
Do-more graph, set the rate to however many books I want to read per day/month/year, go!

<p>
  It has turned out that it&#8217;s a lot more complicated than that, and because it&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve been trying to figure out since I started using Beeminder in 2014, on and off, through many different formulations of the goal&#8230; it&#8217;s something worth dissecting a bit. 
Is it just having a hammer and trying to force everything to be a nail? 
Or is there a way to beemind anything if you really try?
</p>
<p>
  (Maybe it&#8217;s a measure of how not-simple this actually is that in a draft of this post, Danny was unsure whether I meant to say I’d set the rate to number of books or number of pages, because &#8220;beeminding &#8216;number of books&#8217; as a do-more goal sounds like something that wouldn&#8217;t be realistic for anyone but Nicky&#8221;.
Oops.)

  The Background

<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;There are way too many books left for me to slow down

  &#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  I&#8217;ve been a reader almost all my life, ever since my mother finally found a book exciting enough to convince me to try. 
I went from being behind my peers in reading to leaping ahead of them within a year; from nothing to The Hobbit via The Famous Five in the space of about a year. 
I was never without a book from that point on: maxing out my library cards; running up fines for my mother as I read Isaac Asimov&#8217;s
  <em>
    The Positronic Man
  </em>

  over and over again; taking a box of books on every weekend holiday (and reading them all, too). 
My school actually forbade me to take my books outside at breaktime, probably to encourage me to socialise with people other than Bilbo Baggins and NDR-113. 
Right up through my GCSEs, my A Levels, and my first degree, I was a reading maniac. 
In 2012, I read 500 books.
</p>
<p>
  At the moment, I read about 200 books a year. 
Ostensibly, I have at least as much free time, though admittedly I&#8217;m no longer studying literature&#8230; 
but I’m not reading anything like the number of books I used to.
</p>
<p>
  This is not what I want.

<h2>
  Beeminder To The Rescue
</h2>
<p>
  I&#8217;ve tried the simple do-more approach I mentioned above several times. 
My
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/shanaqui/2016-reading\\"
    title=\\"309 books in a year! Not bad!\\"
  >
    2016-reading
  </a>
  goal is a good example of that. 
I&#8217;ve tried reading from my to-be-read pile&#8230; uh, bookshelf, and treating it as a backlog, as in my
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/shanaqui/bookbacklog\\"
    title=\\"This went downhill fast... or actually not\\"
  >
    bookbacklog
  </a>
  goal.
</p>
<p>
  The 2016-reading goal looks pretty good, to be honest. 
But I&#8217;ve noticed that this attempt to finish more books has led to me being very hesitant to pick up longer books &#8212; I&#8217;ve got to be sure I can finish it in time to put in a +1 on my graph! 
I&#8217;d never have read The Lord of the Rings &#8212; the book I read and reread eagerly under the table during maths (sorry, Mr Carter) during my GCSEs &#8212; if I&#8217;d had a do-more graph ticking away at the time.
</p>
<p>
  There are some obvious reformulations that spring to mind: 
perhaps I just needed a pages goal, instead. 
The problem is, I also read ebooks, and it&#8217;s often difficult to gauge how many pages they have. 
A problem with both pages read and books read goals is that books aren&#8217;t equal in complexity: 
I recently read a book on archaeology (Eric H. Cline’s
  <em>
    Digging Up Armageddon
  </em>
  ) where 10 pages took me as long as 50 pages of Mary Stewart&#8217;s
  <em>
    Nine Coaches Waiting
  </em>
  .
</p>
<p>
  Overall, beeminding reading seemed like a pretty failed experiment, and I left it alone for a while. 
But as my wife says, “Beeminder is my operating system”. 
I really wanted to figure this out!
</p>
<h2>
  The Obvious Answer
</h2>

      <img
        class=\\"aligncenter\\"

        Nicky&#8217;s hour of reading per day goal
      </i>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>
<p>
  I did think about just tracking my reading time, and trying to increase that. 
Thus was
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/shanaqui/hourofreading\\"
    title=\\"Just an hour, every day -- I can do that, right?!\\"
  >
    hourofreading
  </a>
  born! 
And it worked, kind of: 
I eked out an hour of every day (on average) to read, and I mostly read whatever I wanted. 
It&#8217;s taking a while to shed the feeling that I should be finishing books all the time, every day, and that I should be reading particular books from my backlog that have been waiting a long time for me to be in the mood.
</p>
<p>
  I was still only reading as much as Beeminder required me to, somehow. 
But there was a breakthrough here, and it was deciding to follow the motto of a certain family from literature: 
I would read, I decided, &#8220;As my Whimsy takes me.&#8221;
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"

  </a>
</p>
<h2>
  The Real Question
</h2>
<p>
  After that, I came to a realisation that the best way to figure out how to go back to the way I used to be is to work out what changed. 
I know, go figure, right? 
So part of that was reading whatever I feel like, but there&#8217;s more; even with my
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/shanaqui/hourofreading\\"
    title=\\"Just... one... hour... every day\\"
  >
    hourofreading
  </a>
  goal, I was only reading about an hour a day, and definitely very far from the 1.4 books I was reading on average back in 2012.
</p>
<p>
  So here&#8217;s the real question, the one that makes this case study applicable to any Beeminder goal you&#8217;ll ever make: 
what is keeping me from doing what I want?
</p>
<p>
  Sometimes, it&#8217;s really simple. 
It&#8217;s procrastination, and a Beeminder graph with $30 at stake will be enough, on its own, to make you do the thing. 
It&#8217;s not spending enough time on something, and that can be fixed with a
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/toggl/\\"
    title=\\"Check out our Toggl integration!\\"
  >
    Toggl-linked
  </a>
  goal tracking your time and dinging you when you don&#8217;t meet your targets. 
It&#8217;s forgetting about it, and then Beeminder will remind you until you do it out of sheer annoyance (or heartfelt gratitude).
</p>
<p>
  Sometimes it&#8217;s more complex, and you have to think about how to get at the different components of what&#8217;s going wrong for you. 
Maybe you&#8217;re struggling with a goal about time spent focusing on writing your thesis &#8212; and you also find when you look at
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/rescuetime/\\"
    title=\\"Got any RescueTime goals yet?\\"
  >
    RescueTime
  </a>
  that somehow you&#8217;re spending two hours a day on social media. 
You can use two Beeminder goals in tandem: 
one for focused time on your thesis, and a do-less goal for social media time, linking RescueTime to use the autodata to keep you honest.
</p>
<h2>
  Looking At My Answer Sheet
</h2>
<p>
  So what was keeping me from reading?
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    I have other hobbies now, like videogames and cross-stitch
  </li>
  <li>
    I have a job now (counterpoint: my hours now are about the same as the time I spent in school)
  </li>
  <li>
    I keep Slack on all evening, and there&#8217;s a good chance I never quite turn off from my work mindset
  </li>
  <li>
    Twitter is always there to fragment my attention
  </li>
  <li>
    I have an anxiety disorder, and that can ruin your focus
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Those are just a few factors that I considered, to give you a flavour of how I answered that question about how things changed. 
It turns out that I don&#8217;t want to change some of these factors &#8212; I like doing cross-stitch! 
But others can be worked on. 
The most transformative thing for my
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/shanaqui/hourofreading\\"
    title=\\"Just an hour a day! I really can do it!\\"
  >
    hourofreading
  </a>
  graph was limiting my working hours with the
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/shanaqui/clockoff\\"
    title=\\"I don’t go over the limit... much\\"
  >
    clockoff
  </a>
  goal, and setting strict limits to when I work. 
Right as I introduced those, you can see the trend going upward on the hourofreading graph!
</p>
<p>
  I&#8217;ve had some other clever ideas, like low-pressure ways to keep me reading books that take me a bit longer. 
What&#8217;s going wrong there? 
If I bog down in a book due to mood or a slow part or other circumstances, I might never come back. 
Alright: so make a graph and keep the book on the backburner, so to speak &#8212; no other requirements, I can read as many other books in tandem as I like.
</p>
<p>
  So I set up an odometer graph requiring just 5 pages per day, set up an
  <a
    href=\\"https://help.beeminder.com/article/56-can-i-get-rid-of-extra-safety-buffer\\"
    title=\\"It’s a great premium perk!\\"
  >
    autoratchet
  </a>
  so it can&#8217;t accumulate safety buffer&#8230; and so far each of those books has been finished within a week of creating the graph, even though I only needed to read five pages a day.

<h2>
  The Takeaway
</h2>
<p>
  I&#8217;d like to say here that everything is beemindable in one way or another, but I&#8217;m positive someone&#8217;s got a counterexample ready. 
What I can definitely say is that sometimes it takes the right approach to the problem &#8212; you need to ask the right question: 
what is keeping me from doing what I want? 
Beemind the answer to that question, and be prepared for some trial and error.

<p>
  Here&#8217;s a suggestion we hear from time to time:
&#8220;Let me mind both sides of the Yellow Brick Road!&#8221;
For example, maybe you want to neither sleep too much nor too little.
Conceptually you could do this with a goal that was a combination of
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/glossary/#domore\\"
    title=\\"This is the default and by far most common goal type in Beeminder.\\"
  >
    Do More
  </a>
  and
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/glossary/#doless\\"
    title=\\"Yes, these are links to our glossary. A Do Less goal is for something like time spent on Facebook or servings of sugar.\\"
  >
    Do Less
  </a>
  .
You&#8217;d be penalized for going off the Yellow Brick Road in either direction.
Some people just can&#8217;t get enough of Beeminder&#8217;s iron fist of motivation.
</p>
<p>
  But I contend that it shouldn&#8217;t really ever be necessary to beemind both limits. 
You&#8217;re probably only akratic about one limit &#8212; search your feelings, you know it to be true! &#8212; so pick Do More or Do Less and just be on your honor to also not go too far into the good side.
</p>
<p>
  Basically: Beeminder minds the &#8220;bad&#8221; side and you mind the &#8220;good&#8221; side yourself.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;Beeminder minds the &#8216;bad&#8217; side and you mind the &#8216;good&#8217; side yourself.&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  For the case of sleeping neither too much or too little, for example, you can have Beeminder force you to sleep enough and then just start setting an alarm if you get above your road. 
Beeminder is still providing guidance on both limits, just that only one limit has teeth.
</p>
<p>
  Or maybe you want to force yourself to get to bed by a certain time, and also not sleep in too late. 
But then just tracking hours of sleep doesn’t suffice &#8212; you really have to track both bed time and wake time separately since it’s fundamentally two different variables you’re minding.
</p>
<p>
  Of course sometimes what people actually want is to beemind a daily minimum.
They don&#8217;t like that they can get a big safety buffer and then coast for a while because they were extra good before.
The thing to do in that case, though, is to throw away some of your extra safety buffer with the
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/glossary/#ratchet\\"
    title=\\"Short version: You can hit Ratchet to get rid of excess safety buffer you&#39;ve accumulated.\\"
  >
    Ratchet
  </a>
  feature.
</p>
<p>
  Actually getting penalized for going into the good side is, in our experience, never necessary.
Of course, if you think we&#8217;re wrong we want to hear about it!

<p>
  Let&#8217;s start by talking about burnout and balance!
There are plenty of anecdotes and a handful of studies about how productivity is affected by overwork: 
consider books like Dr Devon Price&#8217;s
  <em>
    Laziness Does Not Exist
  </em>
  (spoiler: the theory is that &#8220;laziness&#8221; is a sign from our brains and bodies that something is wrong, same as hunger or thirst), 
or

    href=\\"https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20210819-the-case-for-a-shorter-workweek\\"
    title=\\"We&#39;re lazy and our workdays are over so we&#39;re just linking to this BBC summary article instead of the actual studies\\"
  >
    studies which seem to suggest that productivity improves with shorter work-weeks
  </a>
  .
</p>
<p>
  This all seems like something that might not fit so well with Beeminder, with its binary goals &#8212; 
Do More / Do Less, Weight Loss / Weight Gain &#8212; 
and single Bright Red Line,
not to mention
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/bothsides/\\"
    title=\\"Danny sure does love his extremes &lt;3\\"
  >
    our own blog post about
    <em>
      never
    </em>
    minding both sides
  </a>
  . 
And it&#8217;s true that we don&#8217;t have any goal type that can keep you within a range, and it&#8217;s unlikely to be something we add anytime soon.
</p>
<p>
  But! 
I think it&#8217;s totally possible to beemind both sides anyway, and even valuable at times. 
I have a number of graphs that beemind both sides, and they&#8217;re honestly some of my most important goals.
</p>
<h3>
  How do I do it?
</h3>
<p>
  By having two Beeminder graphs!
</p>
<p>
  &#8230;I know, I know, that&#8217;s a really untechnical answer to the problem, and it&#8217;s something I think will be easier and perhaps more accessible once we have a &#8220;Beeminder meta&#8221; integration which can send data from one goal to another. 
(Currently you can hook up services like Zapier and IFTTT to do that, of course!)
</p>
<p>
  If this is sounding kind of clunky to you, let&#8217;s see if I can convince you!
</p>
<h3>
  Allowing for nuance
</h3>
<p>
  The thing with having two separate goals for &#8220;Doing Enough Of A Thing&#8221; and &#8220;Not Doing Too Much of a Thing&#8221; is that it really lets you see where you&#8217;re struggling. 
It&#8217;s possible that you&#8217;ll derail on both goals equally, but it seems unlikely.
</p>
<p>
  For me, I&#8217;m more likely to overwork than not work enough, for example. 
This is a thing I would never have guessed about myself, but I&#8217;ve
  <em>
    never
  </em>
  derailed on the goal that tracks the amount of time I need to spend working for Beeminder. 
By contrast, I&#8217;ve derailed on the goal that caps my hours worked per day
  <em>
    three times so far in 2022
  </em>
  . 
My problem isn&#8217;t even what I expected it to be, so having two goals for this gave me some really interesting data about my own behaviour!
</p>
<p>
  It also allows you to set different rates for the two bounds.
For instance, you may want a break on one (no need to do as much of the thing) while leaving the other at the same rate (it&#8217;s still important you do more than the lower bound), for instance. 
Or for one to be tracked in hours and another to be a binary yes/no. 
Maybe you could even do something clever with how the data aggregates per day in one graph, while the other just reports the straight data.
</p>
<p>
  Most importantly for me, it allows the motivation (the pledge at stake) to be proportionate to the actual temptation to fail at the goal. 
You can be up to $270 on one goal because you always suck at studying enough, while you&#8217;re only at $10 on the other because you are actually
  <em>
    pretty
  </em>
  good at ensuring you stop for the day (as long as you have Beeminder nipping at your heels).
</p>
<p>
  Having a single goal that just keeps you within a range and charges you for falling out of it collapses that important context and removes that
  <em>
    proportionate
  </em>
  response to ending up on the wrong side of the bright red line. 
I don&#8217;t want to suck at either, but it only takes $5 to keep me doing my daily hours, while we&#8217;re at $30 and counting for what will make me actually stop on time.
</p>
<h3>
  Nicky&#8217;s use cases
</h3>
<p>
  As always, I have some graphs to show off to make my point! 
Sometimes it&#8217;s straightforward: 
you beemind getting enough hours in one graph, 
and not doing too many in another. 
That&#8217;s the case with the meta goal that counts my Beeminder hours, 
and the goal that counts my total number of hours per day (though this also includes my hours for my side gig).

  But you can also create balance via multiple Beeminder goals using different but related metrics. 
For instance, I also beemind my earnings: 
every evening I estimate how much I&#8217;ve earned during the day and put that into my earnings graph. 
So I want more money! 
But as I&#8217;ve remarked elsewhere, I&#8217;m a bag of nerves disguised as a person. 
I want to do
  <em>
    all
  </em>
  the work, and impress people thereby. 
My brain needs (a lot) more rest than I would naturally be inclined to allow it. 
So I would argue that the graph that
  <em>
    really
  </em>
  balances out my clockoff goal is this one:
</p>
<a href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/shanaqui/earning\\">
  <img
    class=\\"aligncenter\\"
    alt=\\"Nicky's Earning graph\\"
    title=\\"Nicky's Earning graph\\"
    src=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/nicky-earning.png\\"
  >
</a>
<p>
  I end up beeminding staying under a certain number of hours per day, while also earning a certain amount of money per day. 
Earning is a better metric than the number of hours I work, because I have multiple clients. 
I can earn more in a given day by prioritising the work that pays better, while keeping below that threshold on my clockoff goal. 
The amount I earn and the number of hours I work are related numbers, but wouldn&#8217;t fit on the same graph very naturally.
</p>
<p>
  I even balance my Beeminder usage
  <em>
    in general
  </em>
  . 
I have a lot of goals, a lot of plates spinning, and that takes a lot of time. 
I was noticing that my evenings were getting eaten by beemergencies. 
One solution to that would be custom deadlines, but that doesn&#8217;t work on most autodata goals. 
Enter my stopbyseven goal!
</p>

</a>
<p>
  Now I have to finish my Beeminder goals by 7pm, six days out of every seven, leaving me a lot more time to loaf around and play video games.
</p>
<h2>
  Conclusion
</h2>
<p>
  We said once that it shouldn&#8217;t ever be necessary to beemind both limits, but let the record stand amended: 
Nicky at least is convinced that it can be useful to beemind both sides! 
My contention, though, is that Beeminder can already do that, and that it&#8217;s way more versatile, intuitive, and
  <em>
    useful
  </em>
  this way.

  Let&#8217;s talk about some novel ways to use Beeminder!
Whenever we hear about one of these I want to slap up a big smiling picture of the user in our &#8220;new favorite Beeminder&#8221; frame.
</p>
<p>
  First though, this entire post is a thinly veiled excuse to point out that OHMYGODGUYS
  <a href=\\"http://www.fogcreek.com\\">
    Fog Creek
  </a>
  likes us, they really really like us! 
Check out this excerpt from
  <a href=\\"http://blog.fogcreek.com/dogfooding-until-it-hurts/\\">
    Dogfooding Until It Hurts
  </a>
  :
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    &#8230;if you really want to see &#8220;dogfooding until it hurts&#8221;
    <strong>
      in action
    </strong>
    , check out
    <a href=\\"http://beeminder.com\\">
      Beeminder
    </a>
    , a tool for setting &#8220;goals with a sting.&#8221;
You set up your goals, and if you stray from them, the service fines you an escalating amount of real money until you&#8217;re back on track.
Beeminder is dogfooding heavily and publicly to keep their development goals on track.
These folks are
    <a
      href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/blogdog/\\"
      title=\\"Beeminder Dogfooding\\"
    >
      literally giving away cold hard cash
    </a>
    to users as a pre-commitment to do things like delivering user-visible enhancements or blog posts on a regular basis.
Amazing.
Even better, they have a
    <a
      href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/trello\\"
      title=\\"Beeminder Trello Integration\\"
    >
      Trello integration
    </a>
    that’ll keep you moving those cards to the
    <strong>
      Done
    </strong>
    column regularly (or else).
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  So, yes, there are some powerful ways to beemind your startup, some which we&#8217;ll devote future blog posts to (and feel free to check out our
  <a
    href=\\"https://trello.com/card/startups-let-your-users-mind-your-changelog/5077740103f3b19b441c88f6/19\\"
    title=\\"Trello card with our notes on Beeminding User-Visible Improvements\\"
  >
    rough notes
  </a>
  in the meantime).
Another idea from the Fog Creek / Trello folks: sending someone a self-enforcing to-do list, thanks to the
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/trello\\">
    Trello+Beeminder integration
  </a>
  .
For example,
  <a href=\\"https://twitter.com/richarmstrong\\">
    Rich Armstrong
  </a>
  is telling his family members who need computer help because their Hotmail got hacked again, basically:
&#8220;
  <a href=\\"https://trello.com/board/finally-taking-control-of-your-online-security/513787fe904b861b580080ae\\">
    I won&#8217;t fix your computer until you&#8217;ve done the following security basics
  </a>
  &#8221;.
In general the idea is to make a
  <a
    href=\\"http://trello.com\\"
    title=\\"We love Trello possibly even more than we love Jello\\"
  >
    Trello
  </a>
  checklist for someone and then send them a link to it.
The first item in the list can be a link to set up a Beeminder goal for the list, so they&#8217;re bound to keep at it until they eventually finish.
</p>
<p>
  What are some other awesome ways Beeminder users think outside the box?
Yes, at least half our users are still interested in losing weight.
If you count all the exercise goals too then it&#8217;s over two thirds who are tracking fitness related stuff.
But we can do more, y&#8217;all!
</p>
<h2>
  Bundle Goals and The Beeminding of Fun
</h2>
<p>
  We&#8217;ve blogged about the
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/mustdo\\">
    Must-Do system
  </a>
  before, which I&#8217;m finding quite powerful. 
You could take this idea of a sort of bundle goal and use it for lots of things.
  <a href=\\"http://www.hellyer.net/\\">
    Philip Hellyer
  </a>
  tracks several daily practices &#8212; physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual &#8212; in one goal.
He says &#8220;my goal for this doesn’t care which of those things I do, so long as I maintain my weekly momentum.
It’s my choice on any given day whether I brainstorm a bunch, hit the gym, meditate, or do anything else that defensibly counts as one of the 4 components.&#8221;
Another idea from
  <a href=\\"http://oldgods.net/alys/\\">
    Alys
  </a>
  is a healthy eating goal.
Make a list of various dietary elements that you want to consume regularly and assign points for every class, all going into one bundle goal.
For example, 1 point for each serving of protein and 2 points for each serving of vegetables.
You could even do negative points for servings of sugar!
Then there&#8217;s
  <a href=\\"http://twitter.com/pjf\\">
    Paul Fenwick
  </a>
  &#8217;s delightfully nerdy
  <a href=\\"https://github.com/pjf/remember-the-beeminder\\">
    Remember-the-Beeminder
  </a>
  &#8212; 
an integration with Remember The Milk and Beeminder where he gets points for finishing items on his to-do list and the points vary depending on how stale the item is and how he originally tagged it when it was added.

  &#8220;I especially love beeminding hobbies because it is both an enforcement and an excuse.&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/gratitude\\">

  </a>
  is another great one.
And although beeminding hobbies is old hat by now &#8212; starting with

  >
    do what you truly want to do
  </a>
  , 
and that doesn&#8217;t always happen when left to our own devices.
I especially love beeminding hobbies because it is both an enforcement and an excuse. 
I beemind my craft projects because sometimes I don&#8217;t spend enough time on them, but when I come to an emergency day it&#8217;s wonderfully liberating to sit down without any guilt.
Maybe there are other things that seem more important, like if I&#8217;m not playing with the kids or working on Beeminder maybe I
  <em>
    should
  </em>
  be cleaning the bathroom or folding laundry, for some values of should.
But it turns out those are usually pretty stupid values of should and if I have an emergency craft day, well, I conveniently planned last week that crafting would be the most urgent and important thing today.
I can sit down without guilt and spend 25 minutes knitting because I want to and because I have to.
(Dreeves feels similarly about

  .)
</p>
<h2 id=\\"proxy\\">
  Proxy Beeminding
</h2>
<p>
  A lot of our own beeminding is proxy beeminding.
Like how our
  <a href=\\"http://beeminder.com/meta/uvi\\">
    User-Visible Improvements
  </a>
  goal is a proxy for inexorable forward progress and never giving up.
When what you really care about isn&#8217;t straightforward to measure and track, you can often find another metric that is and beemind that instead.
Like
  <a href=\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_O'Brien\\">
    Danny O&#8217;Brien
  </a>
  &#8217;s browser hack.
He wrote some code to automatically beemind how many websites he&#8217;d visited in a day as he found it correlates well to his distraction. 
More websites = more distraction.
</p>
<p>
  Here&#8217;s another example: I track my sugar-free days.
What I really want is to reduce my overall sugar intake.
Set-a-limit goals do that nicely but set-a-limit goals are a bit fundamentally broken (we&#8217;re working on this!) in that they can be rather loosely binding unless you have an automatic data source.
[UPDATE: We
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/less\\">
    fixed Set-a-limit goals, and renamed them
  </a>
  to Do Less.]
And keeping track of my servings of sugar becomes too easy to get vague about. 
If I don&#8217;t remember to update the moment I eat a cookie, it&#8217;s very easy to forget later in the day if I ate 1 cookie this afternoon, or was it 10?
But sugar-free days are easy and binary. 
Either I ate some sugary junk or I didn&#8217;t. 
In fact I have a sugar-free emergency today.
Much easier not to eat the girl scout cookies that are sitting out invitingly in the kitchen when it would cost me $90.
(Yes, I once paid $30 for the privilege of eating some ho-ho, and thus wound up at the $90 pledge level).
</p>
<p>
  Yes, in theory I could eat twice as much sugar on my sugar-allowed days and defeat the whole point.
But that would be gross, so in practice this goal succeeds in reducing my sugar consumption just fine.
</p>
<h2 id=\\"creative\\">
  Let&#8217;s Get Creative
</h2>
<p>
  Okay, but those aren&#8217;t really too far outside the box.
They&#8217;re really more peering out the window.
What about
  <a href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/davidhm21/goals/remindfitbit\\">
    David MacFarlane beeminding his bugging of us
  </a>
  until we implemented Fitbit stairs minding?
(For the record, we absolutely adored that, and it absolutely worked!)
Similarly, although this was more of a Beeminder hack than true beeminding,
  <a href=\\"http://investling.com/\\">
    Matthew Fallshaw
  </a>
  used a Beeminder graph to construct a bounty for us for
  <a href=\\"https://trello.com/card/fitbit-integration/4f079dbc30a67d1864012d6b/186\\">
    another Fitbit feature
  </a>
  .
Or how about beeminding the number of safe days on your Beeminder goals to force you to stay further ahead of the game? (We&#8217;ve forgotten who did that one.)
Or beeminding the amount of time you spend coding up your fancy schmancy custom Beeminder to-do list integration (
  <a href=\\"http://facebook.com/paul.fenwick\\">
    Paul Fenwick
  </a>
  again).
</p>
<p>
  Someone told us about an exercise goal they created where they used a deck of cards and assigned an exercise to each suit &#8212; say diamonds are pushups, clubs are kettle bell swings, spades are squats, and hearts are box jumps.
Then they&#8217;d shuffle deck, draw cards one at a time, and do the face value number of reps of each exercise.
Instant random workout, and they beeminded the number of cards they did each week.
(Who was this? Please claim your genius!)

This included an insanely high Beeminder contract to finish the book draft in time (he did), and to try skydiving (also did).
It would have cost him many thousands of dollars not to jump out of that plane.
He also talks about beeminding spontaneous romantic gestures for his girlfriend. SWOON! 
People are always justifying Valentine&#8217;s day with some reasoning along the lines of &#8220;but it&#8217;s a reminder to be kind and demonstrate your love for those around you.&#8221;

    Yes, some people beemind sex. The Beeminder founders can neither confirm nor deny that this includes themselves, nor, if so, whether they&#8217;re set-a-limits or do-mores. [UPDATE 2014: Still no confirmation nor denial but in modern Beeminder parlance that&#8217;s Do More or Do Less goals.]

  There are two things to note about using this feature. 
(1) If you schedule a break far in advance, you won&#8217;t actually see your road change.
By default we only show you two weeks into the future.
If you want to see your impending break, go to the goal&#8217;s advanced settings and adjust the tmax setting to be past the end of your vacation.
(2) If you have a break set in the future, and then you use the road dial to change your slope, you will be changing the road only after all scheduled breaks.

If I only change the road dial, my new rate of 4 won&#8217;t take effect until after my birthday.
So once you schedule a break you can only change the yellow brick road before then by scheduling additional breaks, or &#8220;breaks&#8221; (you can schedule harder sections as well).
It&#8217;s fine to schedule multiple breaks, even if they overlap &#8212; the reasonable thing should always happen, like new ones overwriting old ones.
(Thanks for putting up with the initial bugs there, and definitely let us know if you find any more.)

  We went out of our way to preserve a yellow band next to the Bright Red Line so that we could keep referring to &#8220;the Yellow Brick Road&#8221;.
But it has gradually felt more and more anachronistic and we finally decided to rip off the band-aid.

    me to eschew a jargon-y neologism
  </a>
  in favor of a boring descriptive phrase. 
But I kept experimenting with the terminology and &#8220;bright red line&#8221; kept feeling most natural.
</p>
<h3>
  Onomastic Interlude
</h3>
<p>
  Often it&#8217;s worth introducing jargon because the plain English version is, ironically, too understandable. 
I know that sounds ridiculous but that&#8217;s because you&#8217;re not understanding me yet.
The epiphany for me was the following quote, tenuously attributed to George Bernard Shaw:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    The single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  If you say, for example, &#8220;max safety buffer&#8221; then users, understanding each of those words, will jump to the conclusion that they understand the phrase. 
But

(&#39;Ratchet&#39; and &#39;safety buffer&#39; are also glossary entries.)\\"
  >
    autoratchet
  </a>
  &#8221; means something very specific in Beeminderland and it&#8217;s less confusing for users to hear &#8220;autoratchet&#8221; and know that they don&#8217;t know what it means than to hear &#8220;max safety buffer&#8221; and think they know but be wrong.
</p>
<p>
  As Mark Twain supposedly said, it ain&#8217;t what you don&#8217;t know that gets you into trouble. 
It&#8217;s what you know that ain&#8217;t so.
</p>
<h3>
  The Bottom (wait for it) Line
</h3>
<p>
  The beauty of &#8220;bright red line&#8221; is that it doesn&#8217;t have that problem. 
It describes perfectly literally what we draw on your graph and it has exactly the line-in-the-sand connotation that&#8217;s at the heart of Beeminder. 
Cross this line, pay money.
</p>
<p>
  Compare to &#8220;beeline&#8221; which connotes getting from A to B as fast as possible, which doesn&#8217;t really jibe with Beeminder&#8217;s philosophy. 
This is also kind of a problem with the term &#8220;goal&#8221;, but that&#8217;s a different

  Isn&#8217;t that the same thing?
There&#8217;s a critical edge of that band and that&#8217;s effectively the bright line.
You can go off that band in the other direction and that just makes you extra safe.
Yes yes yes, but we defined the line to your goal in terms of the center of that band and that was a monstrous monkey wrench messing up everything.
The real difference is that now that line that you set is the critical bright line, the thing you can&#8217;t cross, and everything is drastically better this way.

  Quoting myself from a daily beemail when I was in the midst of this undertaking:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Imagine if we discovered not just life on Mars but actual people. 
Then imagine that you were in charge of an umpteen-volume encyclopedia and had to change every instance of &#8220;humans&#8221; and &#8220;people&#8221; and such to &#8220;earthlings&#8221; or &#8220;terrestrians&#8221; to disambiguate. 
That&#8217;s kind of how daunted I&#8217;m feeling with this &#8220;Yellow Brick Road&#8221; to &#8220;Bright Red Line&#8221; refactoring!

  but don&#8217;t stop reading if you think those are idiotic! 
It&#8217;s about how to make sure you do something you intend to do but which isn&#8217;t amenable to just putting on your calendar or otherwise immediately committing to. 
Something like running a marathon or taking a trip. 
Bucket list items, let&#8217;s say.
</p>
<p>
  Let&#8217;s start with what not to do:
Make your bucket list and beemind ticking off one item per month or year.
You can technically
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/chunky\\"
    title=\\"&#39;It&#39;s Chunky Time&#39;, about how, by having an initial flat spot in your yellow brick road, you can start with enough safety buffer to be able to beemind things that happen in sporadic chunks of time as opposed to daily\\"
  >
    make that work
  </a>
  but Beeminder works best when it can enforce daily incremental progress.
</p>
<p>
  So here&#8217;s what you do: 
Start a Beeminder goal for spending an hour a week on preparation: 
researching, 
coordinating with people, 
scheduling, 
ordering supplies, 
clearing your schedule, 
announcing it, 
scheduling breaks in your other yellow brick roads, etc. 
The adventure or whatever it is can also count toward that goal, so whenever you actually embark you&#8217;ll immediately shoot way above the yellow brick road. 
If it was a one-time deal, you can then safely archive it.
</p>
<p>
  It&#8217;s a way to meaningfully commit to making something happen eventually without having to commit to a date off the bat, which is so easy to procrastinate indefinitely on. 
But creating that Beeminder goal should take 30 seconds and involve no work till next week!
</p>
<h3>

<p>
  Yes but the problem with beeminding time spent on travel planning is that you can spend countless hours in vaguely planning-related tasks without ever going on a trip.

<p>
  I&#8217;m allowed to enter any fractional amount under 1 that it seems like the work I&#8217;ve done counts for, but I can&#8217;t enter the final amount (and actually get to &#8220;1&#8221;) until travel and accommodations are paid for and there&#8217;s one thing planned for each day of the trip.
Of course this requires picking actual deadlines for the adventures, as well as being halfway reasonable about the fractional estimates.
On the plus side, fractional beeminding instead of beeminding time means you don&#8217;t end up going to medical school.

But I know the big question on everyone&#8217;s mind has been &#8220;what labels do they use for bugs in their issue tracker?&#8221;
Well here I am to answer that question!
We have 15 labels at the moment.
Eight are descriptive and six are the ones Joel Spolsky proposed around the turn of the century in his

<p>
  BUG and RFE are self-explanatory;
it&#8217;s nice to distinguish between things that are actually buggy vs just new hotness we want.
Sometimes that line is fuzzy though and you could tag something as both BUG and RFE if you can&#8217;t decide which it counts as.
</p>
<p>
  If you&#8217;ve been hanging out in Beeminderland long you know about UVIs.
It&#8217;s handy for us to mark those for collecting
  <a
    href=\\"http://beeminder.com/changelog\\"
    title=\\"Beeminder&#39;s public changelog\\"
  >
    user-visible improvements to tweet about
  </a>
  .
Or if we&#8217;re scrambling to ship a UVI in time we might look for issues marked UVI and PEA &#8212; easy-peasy improvements.
(The UVI label is actually almost ubiquitous so it might make more sense to have an INF label for issues that
  <em>
    aren&#8217;t
  </em>
  visible to users, i.e., infrastructure.)
</p>
<p>
  The STY label is handy to filter out if you have zero aesthetic sense or are allergic to CSS.
Or maybe you&#8217;re our web designer 
(

  )
and want to focus on these.
</p>
<p>
  The idea with marking issues as Mendoza (MEN) is that if it&#8217;s part of a new feature branch or a new product, it can&#8217;t be merged or released until all the Mendozas are done.
The Mendoza Line is a baseball term referring to a minimum threshold of acceptability. 
It&#8217;s similar to the notion of a Minimum Viable Product. 
(Which is what we mean by &#8216;MVP&#8217;, not to be confused with the baseball term &#8216;MVP&#8217; which means &#8216;Most Valuable Player&#8217;. 
This is what we get for mixing baseball and software metaphors!)
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  GitHub pro tip: See all issues that are closed but not fixed with with a filter like so:  
is:issue is:closed -label:zap
</h4>
<p>
  Anyway, marking something Mendoza is kind of like an OMG label for really important stuff.
We used to use OMG but we ruined that one with overuse so we settled on the idea of a Mendoza line since it has a more specific meaning than &#8220;definitely do this&#8221;.
Namely, we&#8217;re agreeing not to launch this new thing until everything tagged MEN is resolved (or we relent and un-Mendoza it).
In the past we&#8217;ve also used the Mendoza label after deploying something.
We&#8217;d mark all the issues that needed to be resolved before we felt we could shift gears and focus on something else.
It turns out that&#8217;s a slippery slope.
It devolves into an endless sea of &#8220;definitely do this&#8221; items, just like with an OMG label.
So we&#8217;ve learned not to do that anymore.
</p>
<p>
  (UPDATE: We&#8217;ve resurrected the OMG label but with a strict rule that there can only be 25 (one page in GitHub) of them at a time.
Which means a one-in-one-out rule when you want to label a new item OMG.
Further UPDATE: This is very hard to enforce and keep on top of!
But GitHub has a new pinning feature that enforces a limit of 3 pinned issues, so we may kill the OMG label again and go with that.)
</p>
<p>
  SKY is for pie-in-the-sky, which is mostly self-explanatory.
It can mark something as especially awesome but also lower-priority because it suggests that it may not be worth the cost of implementing.
If you&#8217;re looking for something to actually accomplish, you might want to filter out the SKYs.
As I mentioned, PEA is for easy-peasy which is a good place to look if you want a quick win.
SKY and PEA are mostly mutually exclusive, though you might tag something as both if you&#8217;re totally unsure how hard it might be.
</p>
<p>
  ABC is for prose and copy.
Maybe you don&#8217;t speak great English and want to steer clear of these, or you don&#8217;t speak the programming language and these are the only issues you can tackle.
</p>
<p>
  Last in the all-caps descriptive labels is the ADO label, which means &#8220;not actionable&#8221; or &#8220;still in the realm of opinion&#8221;.
In
  <a
    href=\\"https://trello.com/b/Quw3lqbb/beeflat\\"
    title=\\"This Trello board was made for the Great Redesign of 2016 and we&#39;re very gradually transitioning to GitHub issues.\\"
  >
    Trello
  </a>
  we&#8217;ve indicated these with a separate list called &#8220;Ideas&#8221;.
They&#8217;re things requiring clarification or more discussion or need splitting up into separate issues before being circumscribed enough to take action on.
Definitely filter out the ADOs when looking for something to actually accomplish.
</p>
<h3>
  Always Be Closing
</h3>
<p>
  That brings us to
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/11/08/painless-bug-tracking/\\"
    title=\\"This is also the source for the three things every good bug report needs: (1) steps to reproduce, (2) what you expected to see, and (3) what you saw instead.\\"
  >
    Joel Spolsky&#8217;s six ways
  </a>
  to resolve or close a bug.
Those labels are lowercase because they&#8217;re lower priority.
Well, zero priority, being closed and all.
It&#8217;s a mnemonic, ok?
</p>
<p>
  Joel also recommends that the fixer of a bug should mark the issue fixed/resolved and only the person who actually opened the issue should close it.
We take some liberty there and just say that the person who opened it should at least notice when it&#8217;s closed and either agree by labeling it &#8220;zap&#8221; or &#8220;nix&#8221; or whatnot or else reopen it with a comment.
</p>
<p>
  UPDATE: No liberties!
The fixer applies the label and the opener closes.
  <br>
  Further UPDATE: 
We&#8217;re back full circle!
Since GitHub has a feature to automatically close an issue with a commit (by including, e.g., &#8220;fixes #123&#8221; in the commit message) we allow those to be switched.
Either the fixer applies the label to resolve the issue and opener closes it, or the fixes closes the issue and the opener confirms by applying the label.
</p>
<p>
  UPDATE: We&#8217;ve added a rule that you can only close something as postponed (&#8220;zzz&#8221;) if an open issue links to it.
To help ensure that, the snoozed issue should link to the open issue as well.
This let&#8217;s you say &#8220;think about issue X only after resolving Y&#8221; and since issue Y links to the snoozed issue, the snoozed issue can&#8217;t go fully out of sight out of mind and is safe to be closed.
</p>
<h3>
  What Not To Label
</h3>
<p>
  The main rule is to only make a label for something because it&#8217;s actually helpful to filter on.
Don&#8217;t make ontologies for the sake of
  <a
    href=\\"https://twitter.com/dreev/status/708020499477999616\\"
    title=\\"I tried to argue this point on Twitter once, with fewer vowels\\"
  >
    pure epistemic virtue
  </a>
  .
Like don&#8217;t make tags to mark whether something is a proposed new feature vs a modification of an existing one, or whether it involves the API vs the website.
It&#8217;s easy to make the label ontology overwhelming and then people won&#8217;t use the right labels and the whole point will be defeated.
So wait till there&#8217;s a clear and present need before creating new labels!
</p>
<p>
  That&#8217;s actually a pretty general software principle: don&#8217;t ever write code or create a system because you anticipate it being useful.
Be lazy and put it off till you can&#8217;t live without it.
Another manifestation of this is the
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/shirknturk\\"
    title=\\"Beeminder blog post about how, when writing a new app or website or feature, you should implement as little of it as you can get away with and manually fake the rest behind the scenes\\"
  >
    Shirk &amp; Turk Principle
  </a>
  .
</p>
<p>
  I mentioned that we abandoned our OMG label for indicating high-priority issues.
At one time we concocted a whole schema for assigning priorities to issues before deciding there is simply no point to doing this.
For one, deciding priorities is agonizing.
And it doesn&#8217;t even end up helping with triage.
Whatever the higest priority is, you gradually end up with an overwhelming number of those, and everything lower ends up being tantamount to &#8220;this one isn&#8217;t as important&#8221; in which case it&#8217;s better to close it as &#8220;zzz&#8221; (postponed).
Or maybe it can be classified as SKY (pie in the sky).
At best we use our fancy priority schema when something catastrophic happens, as a concise way to convey the relative importance of various emergency response tasks.
</p>
<h3>
  The Future
</h3>
<p>
  This has been useful for us to write up &#8212; and thank you for indulging us! &#8212; but in terms of advice for anyone else it&#8217;s a bit self-defeating.
I&#8217;m telling you you shouldn&#8217;t ever create a new label without a clear and present need for it.
So that certainly includes a set of labels some other startup or project finds useful.
</p>
<p>
  Some of our labels seem maybe sort of universal but you should also work to keep your ontology minimal.
So let me end with some open questions for ourselves as our ontology evolves:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Can we jettison the RFE (feature request) label? 
It seemed like a logical counterpart to the BUG label but do we ever want to isolate the list of feature requests or filter them out?
Maybe not badly enough to be worth the added friction when creating issues!
  </li>
  <li>
    Can we merge the SKY (pie in the sky) and ADO (too nebulous to be actionable) labels?
They&#8217;re logically different but both amount to &#8220;we&#8217;re not sure this is ready to be or should be worked on&#8221;.
  </li>
  <li>
    Do we want a new label for things a non-technical person could resolve?
(Maybe &#8220;ABC&#8221; because these will usually involve prose or webcopy tweaks.)
Time will tell!
UPDATE: A year later, we&#8217;re tentatively adding it.
  </li>
  <li>
    UPDATE: See the comments for debate about nixing the &#8220;nix&#8221; label.
  </li>
</ol>

  The Past AKA This Blog Post&#8217;s Changelog

  We wrote the first version of this blog post in 2017 and our usage of GitHub kept evolving.
But it turned out to be useful to refer to this post so we kept updating it.

  If you create a fresh GitHub repository, you get the following labels by default.

<p>
  It&#8217;s funny how universal it is for users (including programmers, including myself) to gravitate so strongly to 
&#8220;it&#8217;s probably just me / my crappy phone / my timezone / me not reading the webcopy / me not being deserving of love or working software / etc&#8221;.
It might be an impulse to be kind and not blame the pitiable developers. 
Or it could be the fear of submitting a bug-report-that-isn&#8217;t and feeling foolish.
</p>
<p>
  Of course rationally it&#8217;s much better to just submit it and if we get to
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/buglabels\\"
    title=\\"Previous blog post, for developers only, about our bug label ontology\\"
  >
    close it
  </a>
  as
PEBKAC or 
could-not-reproduce or 
WONTFIX or 
whatever that&#8217;s A++ for us and definitely still valuable to have in the bug database!
</p>
<p>
  Now I face a dilemma.
</p>
<p>
  I want to tell you about Proper Bug Reports, because it&#8217;s a thing worth knowing, except that it&#8217;s totally at odds with the point of this entreaty. 
Because what probably overwhelms the above reasons not to report bugs is simply that it sounds like a hassle. 
So reading any further will only make it sound like more of a hassle.
</p>
<p>
  And so let me beseech you: 
First just tell us something conceivably buggy happened. 
&#8220;When I submitted a datapoint just now the bright red line seemed like it turned purple.&#8221; 
Whatever it is. 
Even if probably you hallucinated (it happens).
</p>
<p>
  Go on.
We&#8217;re over at
  <a href=\\"mailto:support@beeminder.com\\">
    support@beeminder.com
  </a>
  mashing refresh waiting for you.

</p>
<p>
  Ok, at severe risk of making the perfect the enemy of the good, we shall now tell you about Proper Bug Reports, which are like so:
</p>
<div style=\\"border-style:solid;border-width:1px;padding:10px 70px 20px\\">
  <h2>
    <center>
      Defectus Demonstrandum
    </center>
  </h2>
  <br>
  <h3>
    Replicata (Steps to replicate the bug, ex nihilo)
  </h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Create a new Do More goal at a rate of 2 whatevers per week
    </li>
    <li>
      Go to advanced data entry
    </li>
    <li>
      Enter a new datapoint for today with a value of 800080 (the hex code for purple) and comment &#8220;#color&#8221;
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h3>
    Expectata (What You Expected)
  </h3>
  <p>
    That the datapoint would be plotted way above the bright red line and for the red line to be red.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Resultata (What Actually Happens)
  </h3>
  <p>
    The datapoint is plotted fine but the line is purple for a second before reverting to normal!
    <br>
    &nbsp;
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>
    (And then internally we also add
    <i>
      desiderata
    </i>
    for the specific tasks involved or what besides fixing the bug itself needs doing,
    <i>
      nota nebulosa
    </i>
    for additional hints or theories or ideas for fixing the bug,
    <i>
      cognata
    </i>
    for related bug reports, and
    <i>
      verbata
    </i>
    for keywords and phrases to make the bug report easier to search for.
    <i>
      Defectus delenda est!)
    </i>
  </p>
</div>
<p>
  That&#8217;s it! 
It&#8217;s not a real example (I assume &#8212; I didn&#8217;t try it) but it would not be the most gobsmacking bug report we&#8217;ve seen if it were.
Also, those three pieces of a Proper Bug Report &#8212; steps to replicate, what you expected, what actually happens &#8212; are
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/11/08/painless-bug-tracking/\\"
    title=\\"This is also where we got our list of reasons for resolving a bug report: fixed, won&#39;t fix, postponed, could not reproduce, duplicate, by design\\"
  >
    from Joel Spolsky
  </a>
  and I think are pretty standard in software engineering. 
Feel free to make the day of the creators of any software you use by reporting a bug in that format!
</p>
<p>
  UPDATE: We originally listed the three pieces as &#8220;what you did&#8221;, &#8220;what you expected&#8221;, and &#8220;what you saw&#8221; but that misses the most important point of Proper Bug Reports.
It&#8217;s not just the list of steps you took, past tense.
The idea is to start from scratch &#8212; or some specific seed that&#8217;s easy for others to start from &#8212; and see if you can make the bug happen on command, writing down each thing you do along the way.
</p>
<p>
  FURTHER UPDATE: 
These days we label the three sections of our bug reports as &#8220;Replicata&#8221;, &#8220;Expectata&#8221;, and &#8220;Resultata&#8221; because that is how big of nerds we are.
Also we refer to such a bug report as a Defectus Demonstrandum.
We updated the above sample and this post&#8217;s title image accordingly.
</p>
<p>
  YET ANOTHER UPDATE: 
For a while we were using &#8220;Reseminata&#8221; for the steps to reproduce the bug until we finally thought of &#8220;Replicata&#8221;.
</p>
<p>
  UPDATE 2022: We changed &#8220;yellow brick road&#8221; to 
&#8220;
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/brl\\"
    title=\\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, Hellow Bright Red Line\\"
  >
    bright red line
  </a>
  &#8221;.
We&#8217;re not doing that in every old blog post, just ones we find ourselves linking to often.
</p>
<p>
  UPDATE 2023: We keep gradually accumulating more Latin, which I&#8217;ve now edited in to the &#8220;Defectus Demonstrandum&#8221; sidebar:

Let me introduce you to them briefly.

  (Folks with good memories will know we had a brave fourth in the band originally; he&#8217;s no longer with us, but Detective-Inspector Breakfast is always in our hearts.)
</p>
<p>
  This blog post isn&#8217;t just an excuse to share adorable pictures, though, even if I do take any opportunity to do so!
</p>
<p>
  This blog post was sparked by me thanking Beeminder for my latest achievement:
Hulk, our eldest, has reached new heights of affectionate behaviour, and will groom me while I&#8217;m holding her. 
Previously, she might groom me if I was lucky and she had all four feet on the ground, while the other two have always been very affectionate in that line.
</p>
<p>
  So what the heck does Beeminder have to do with that?! 
How can you beemind affection?
</p>
<p>
  Well, you can&#8217;t directly beemind affection, but this goal was actually prompted by other folks&#8217; goals reminding them to make the time to connect with people, hug their kids, and compliment their spouses.
Relationships thrive on attention, so that gives you something to beemind!
</p>
<p>
  It sounds a bit mechanistic to set up a goal to spend time with someone, but I beemind everything else and my wife quite fairly referred to Beeminder as my &#8220;operating system&#8221;&#8230; so I thought it was worth a try.
</p>
<p>
  Initially, I made a goal for each bunny to spend a certain amount of time with each one every single day. 
However, bunnies have moods like any other creature, and some days they just had their own inscrutable reasons to ignore me. 
I didn&#8217;t feel right pushing that &#8212; it only leads to stressed animals, and it&#8217;d be weird to force a person to spend time with you &#8212; and it was hard to judge when I&#8217;d had enough interaction with them to &#8220;count&#8221;. 
I ended up changing it to a simple 1 or 0. 
It doesn&#8217;t matter whether the bun wants to hang out with me or not; as long as I make the attempt to check in with them and give them a chance to cuddle, be pet or use me like a climbing frame, it counts!

  Did it change anything? 
Well, in our old flat it might not have done; the bunnies ran free through the whole living space all the time, and could come and gnaw on my shoelaces any time they wanted my attention. 
But now I have an office of my own, so I have to go and see them properly (at least since Biscuit moved out of my office &#8212; it&#8217;s a wonder I got anything done when she lived in my office as a baby). 
It&#8217;s surprising how easily spending time with them can slip if I get busy. 
The goals are a reminder to put things down and go and check in with them, and to make opportunities for them to hang out with me on their terms.
</p>
<p>

  >
</p>
<p>
  For a while, I wouldn&#8217;t say anything changed. 
But relationships with animals are like relationships with people, and change takes time. 
Over time I found them being more affectionate with me, more trusting overall, and happier to jump up in my lap &#8212; culminating in the surprise grooming from Hulk in the last couple of weeks. 
She&#8217;s around 7 years old, so it&#8217;s a surprise to see her learning a new trick, but since she started, she hasn&#8217;t stopped! 
She still expects her due in pettings, but she&#8217;s happy to make some return as well.
</p>
<p>
  How about Eclair and Biscuit? 
Well, Eclair still prefers my wife&#8217;s company by quite a long way, and Biscuit and I were already close from her days directly supervising my work from a cage by my desk&#8230; but Biscuit
  <em>
    has
  </em>

If I say &#8220;you know what to do&#8221;, she&#8217;ll lick my cheek. 
I can&#8217;t say I really meant to teach her to lick my cheek on command, but there you go&#8230; 
(The full command is actually &#8220;you know what to do, do it with style!&#8221; &#8212; which was me trying to mimic David Tennant&#8217;s delivery for Crowley&#8217;s answerphone message in

  I hadn&#8217;t expected the goals to change my behaviour much, but it really does help. 
It makes me take time out of even the busiest day to spend time with the buns, which is good for all of us. 
And clearly something changed with Hulk as well, and I can only think it&#8217;s this dedicated time with her. 
Even though it seemed mechanical and odd to me at first, I&#8217;m a believer now&#8230; and I ended up making a goal for

  You can&#8217;t beemind affection, but you can beemind making the time, and for those of us with busy schedules, sometimes that reminder is important! 
Having worked this into my routine so much that I&#8217;m not sure how I ever went without, I&#8217;ve archived these goals for now, but I&#8217;m open to the idea of reviving them if that turns out to be a bad idea!
</p>
<p>
  In case you were wondering, I also beemind the less awesome parts when necessary: 
cleaning up after them, vet care, nail clipping, etc.

  The Burgle Bug Fairness Principle is about the most severe kind.
It goes like this:
If we have a bug that incorrectly charges someone and we catch it, we can just refund it. 
If
  <em>
    the user
  </em>
  catches it &#8212; before we say anything to them &#8212; then we have to refund twice the amount we wrongly charged.
</p>
<p>
  This doesn&#8217;t apply to things like non-legit derailments, even those caused by Bum-steer Bugs. 
Because even for an egregious Bum-steer Bug, the derailment did happen and we do explicitly ask &#8220;was this legit?&#8221; so there&#8217;s not much burgliness to it nor too much possibility for it to go unnoticed.
(And to be clear, we do refund those!)
</p>
<p>
  We&#8217;re blogging about this because it really irks us that the double-refund thing is not standard for all businesses. 
If someone makes an error in their own favor, it&#8217;s not remotely enough to be like 
&#8220;Oh, haha, sorry, here&#8217;s the money back that we would&#8217;ve happily stolen if you hadn&#8217;t noticed!&#8221;

</h4>
<p>
  Ok, normal people can stop reading now.
You know what the Burgle Bug Fairness Principle is and the fairness of it is perfectly intuitive so the rest of this post is just belaboring the point for the sheer academic fun of it.
</p>
<p>
  The first academic question is what&#8217;s the justification for double refunds?
Why not triple or just refund plus 10% or something?
To directly go full-nerd on this, the refund should be multiplied by the reciprocal of the probability of the customer noticing &#8212; maybe calculated as the fraction of customers that notice.
Of course we&#8217;re Bayesians so by the
  <a
    href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_indifference\\"
    title=\\"AKA principle of insufficient reason AKA starting with uniform priors\\"
  >
    Principle of Indifference
  </a>
  we could take 1/2 as the prior and thus double-refunds as a starting point.
</p>
<p>
  Or we could just say double refunds because of focality AKA Schelling-pointiness and simplicity and not instantly glazing over the eyes of everyone we&#8217;re trying to convince about the Burgle Bug Fairness Principle!
</p>
<p>
  But where does that &#8220;reciprocal of the probability&#8221; come from?
Suppose we want to fairly redress the burglary in the sense of giving back all the money we burgled, in expectation. 
If 1 out of n users notice and we refund each of those users n times what we stole then overall, on average, we&#8217;ll have refunded 100% of the ill-gotten booty.
Generalizing that means multiplying the reward &#8212; or the fine, from the burglar&#8217;s perspective &#8212; by one over the probability of getting caught.
</p>
<p>
  (Should I pause again to clarify that we&#8217;re not intentionally stealing anyone&#8217;s money despite referring to ourselves as burglars and to burglary literally 17 times in this post? 
The last one we know of &#8212; at least where a user noticed before us &#8212; was years ago
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"BURGLE2\\"
    href=\\"#BURGLE\\"
  >
    [5]
  </a>
  and it&#8217;s far more common that our bugs short-change Beeminder rather than users.)
</p>
<p>
  Of course our intention is to more-than-refund users who notice as well as exactly-refund everyone who didn&#8217;t notice.
So we&#8217;re sticking with double refunds for those who notice before we do, rather than massive payouts for rarely noticed bugs.
That still means giving back more than all of any wrongfully charged money.

  are negative Burgle Bugs, AKA Moneyfire Bugs.
(Brainstorming b-words:
bungle bugs, 
bezzle bugs, 
bloodbath bugs, 
beneficent bugs, 
bankbreaker bugs?
But the real point of the 
bitty&rarr;baneful&rarr;bum-steer&rarr;bamboozle&rarr;burgle hierarchy is to classify severity from a user perspective. 
If we have a &#x1F4B8; bug, that&#8217;s just Baneful if we&#8217;re failing to charge for premium and Bamboozle if we&#8217;re failing to charge for derailments &#8212; &#8220;taking your money&#8221; being the fundamental service Beeminder offers! &#8212; and we can further prioritize based on business reasons as needed.)

  , which is actually to beemind less.
Not necessarily fewer things, but beemind everything less so.
When you&#8217;re first starting I recommend that you pick one thing (or a handful, maybe 5 at most) that you&#8217;re blatantly, egregiously akratic about and focus on it. 
That may also be good advice for veterans who are feeling overwhelmed.
Dial down all but a handful of goals so they&#8217;re no-brainers, put them below the fold in your gallery, or even archive them.

you can beemind myriad things at once without it feeling overwhelming as long as you have other ways besides Beeminder&#8217;s looming sting to keep you on the good side of your yellow brick roads.
Beeminder will feel overwhelming when your expectations for yourself are out of whack with reality.
That&#8217;s your cue to scale back.

But a musical instrument, a bike, a book &#8212; these require investment beyond the actual purchase. 
Some things, like a video game, require rationing lest they be even worse than a waste of money.
</p>
<p>
  So ask yourself, might this purchase be a waste of money (or worse) without a concomitant commitment &#8212; a do-more (or do-less) Beeminder goal?
</p>
<p>
  We decided on this as a family rule a few months into the pandemic (and feel silly it took us until 2020 to think of this), initially for sports equipment and musical instruments.
For example, last summer our daughter Faire borrowed a guitar from her aunt and uncle that she&#8217;s now
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/faire/guitar\\"
    title=\\"Faire&#39;s guitar-playing Beeminder goal\\"
  >
    played hundreds of songs on
  </a>
  .
And Bee swapped her pre-pandemic gym membership for some kettlebells, which she has
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/b/swings\\"
    title=\\"Bee&#39;s kettlebell-swinging Beeminder goal\\"
  >
    swung around many thousands of times
  </a>
  .
</p>
<p>
  In conclusion, make treadmill clothes racks and bibliographic coffee-table paperweights a thing of the past.
Beware buying before beeminding!

does a good job of making accessible the research on and the underlying causes of akrasia, and defending against the notion that it&#8217;s just a lack of willpower.
And our esteemed cofounder, Dr. Reeves, is quoted alongside Professor George Ainslie.
We&#8217;re happy to see this kind of journalism bringing the

Even if you&#8217;re not realistically going to listen to a podcast, the detailed show notes and links are worth perusing.
</p>
<p>
  Other Beeminder buzz highlights include a small segment in a Dutch documentary about Quantified Self, some NaNoWriMo and MaBloWriMo love, and being featured in Trello&#8217;s integration gallery.
We&#8217;re especially touched that the author of &#8220;I Will Teach You A Language&#8221; avers that thousands of words written on his blog over the past couple years are directly thanks to Beeminder.
Finally,

  &#8217;s 
&#8220;Services That Won&#8217;t Buzz Off&#8221; makes a wonderful point about Beeminder&#8217;s immunity to the problem many web services have that you start out strong but quickly fall off the wagon when life gets in the way.
And not just Beeminder itself.
His point is that you can use Beeminder as an antidote to that problem for any service you can connect it to.
</p>
<p>
  For completeness, here&#8217;s the full list of all the Beeminder buzz we&#8217;ve come across since last time.
As always, there&#8217;s no cherrypicking here.
The lack of anti-Beeminder diatribes is in fact evidence that no such diatribes exist.

  It seems &#8220;life-changing&#8221; was no exaggeration. 
He credits Beeminder with 
completing his PhD,

maintaining two blogs, 
learning ancient Hebrew, 
losing 15 pounds, and 
coming within a factor of 2 of the world record for the 500m swim.

We love press, of course, but we particularly delight in hearing about how people are using Beeminder in their life 
(especially when they post it on their own blogs because they beeminded blogging).
We lassoed all the mentions and compiled them here for your persusing pleasure &#8212; including some folks that made some pretty cool integrations!

You want to make sure that after a certain amount of time you’ll be forced to stop doing that thing and move on to something else. Sounds like a commitment contract, right? Normally that&#39;s something that Beeminder would be well suited for, but as things stand it isn&#39;t set up for this kind of thing. Enter Power Tools. With an IFTTT hookup to Beeminder and a timer node, you can do a countdown which is only stopped when you hit a button (say, from a Flic.io device).\\"

      title=\\"Excerpt: The idea behind Beeminder is that it provides short-term pain for slipping on a long-term goal by taking away money from your credit card until you reach the pledge cap (basically, varying the Delay parameter on your Procrastination equation). I was skeptical about Beeminder until I tried it and it worked for me. ... Because my thesis was supposed to be a 150–200 page manuscript, I started Beeminder.com around 4 months before the first draft’s deadline. This transformed me from the amateur that I was to the professional that I am. I had to consistently add to my manuscript 5 days a week for 4 months straight.\\"

You also give to the website your credit card details and if you don&#39;t keep your promise, the site will charge you. I managed to work on my foreign languages on duolingo for 15-30 minutes per day for 4 months ... and it is still going. In order to replicate the experiment with the violin, I need to find a way to track several things, violin pratice time, time on music theory, time on violin theory...\\"

      title=\\"Excerpt: Beeminder is a unique habit tracking app which helps you “put your money where your mouth is” by charging YOU money when you fail. The app creates a customized commitment plan for you based on your goal and timeframe, and sends you reminders along the way. Then, if you ever miss a day or target, your contract commits you to pay. Beeminder is also very data-rich, integrating with lots of apps like Fitbit, Rescuetime, Duolingo &amp; Gmail to name a few. This allows for valuable data tracking with your language-learning habit.\\"

    <a

      title=\\"Excerpt: Another contract play is Beeminder. Similar to Stickk, it forces users to make a commitment to a goal -- along with setting certain progress points that must be met each week. Here, falling off track requires a payment to Beeminder -- a more powerful incentive; it’s almost like Beeminder is betting on your failure. Stickk users may choose their children get the reward if they fall short of their goal; an incentive to stay on track, for sure, but one that doesn’t have the same bite as Beeminder. Here, users pay their taskmaster, and that’s a little bit more distasteful. While not a new app, reviews of the program are fairly high on both the Google Play store and Apple’s App Store, and they are free -- as long as goals continue to be met.\\"

Basically it&#39;s middleware to make it easy to add any new integrations by first giving carte blanche to akr.asia and then hooking up other things to that. Probably we&#39;ll want to build this into Beeminder itself so there’s no seeming sketchiness with authorization. Huge thanks again to Chris for building that! I hope lots of you start trying it out.

  Now that you&#8217;ve clicked on each of those and read each article, blog post, blurb, and podcast, we can fill you in on all the buzz in the 7 or so months since our last press roundup!
</p>
<p>
  Actually, we&#8217;re as overwhelmed by these lists as you (talk about nice problems to have!) so we&#8217;ll break it up.
First is the list of things we&#8217;ve actually read and endorse, and then a list of everything else plus the kitchen sink.
Definitely holler at us if we&#8217;ve relegated something of yours to the bottom list!
We probably just didn&#8217;t get around to more than skimming it yet.
Also, any negative press we may get is definitely going in the top list.
No cherry picking here!

    We&#8217;ll start with an article we have major beefs with but that we suppose is a big deal because

      it&#8217;s in New York Magazine
    </a>
    and our esteemed CEO was interviewed for it.
Unfortunately it gets all sorts of facts wrong so we can&#8217;t recommend it too strongly.
(Most jarring was the claim that &#8220;there&#8217;s a pretty big drop-off in users after they&#8217;re charged for the first time&#8221; when we specifically told the reporter the opposite:
There&#8217;s a big drop-off
    <em>
      before
    </em>
    getting charged the first time, and especially before getting serious enough to actually create a goal. 
But &gt;90% of people stick around after getting charged the first time!)

Actually, we raised the bar a bit this time and jettisoned low-effort listicles or things that seemed to be mentioning Beeminder perfunctorily.
But, as usual, there&#8217;s no cherry-picking. 
It&#8217;s really this unanimous that we&#8217;re this great.

nice public proof you&#8217;re committed to following through on something (except, sadly, it appears to not be a success story in this case)
[UPDATE 2018: Eek, it&#8217;s finally gotten through my head how that came out all wrong.
I intended to shame ourselves, i.e.,
    <em>
      Beeminder
    </em>
    was not a success story in this case.]

  Phew!
As mentioned in a few of the hovertexts, there&#8217;s no cherrypicking there.
If someone talked about Beeminder, good or bad, we did our best to include it in this list.
Of course it&#8217;s essentially universally good because everyone loves us (because we&#8217;re uh-mazing).
But seriously, we&#8217;re so grateful for all the glowing testimonials and creative beeminding and general excitement about Beeminder!
Let us know if we missed you.

Sometimes I schedule a long break in a goal if I&#8217;m not sure, just to see how it feels to not have to worry about it day to day.
</p>
<p>
  And, ok, calendialing needn&#8217;t necessarily be a Beeminder goal, if you have some other trigger prompting you to calendial at the same time every week.
For some people a recurring calendar entry could suffice.
If that&#8217;s you, ignore everything but step 7 in the instructions in the sidebar here.

  This pretty much concludes the public service announcement.
Let me just add this comment from Prof Yorgey himself, illustrating the value of calendialing:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Right now I am coming up to a megabreak for [exciting-sounding vacation], happily scheduled a week ago when my goal told me to. 
I don&#8217;t even want to think about what would happen if I didn&#8217;t remember to do anything about it until, say, today &#8212; which would probably be typical.
I would be scrambling to do several days&#8217; worth of stuff on Friday and Saturday (which I do
    <em>
      not
    </em>
    enjoy).
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Also Bee points out that she used to calendial for scheduling weekends off before the weekends-off feature existed. 
So, pro-tip for cheapskates who don&#8217;t want to pay for that
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/premium\\"

  If that sounds counter-intuitive, imagine the extreme case of ultimate leniency where we&#8217;re like

  &#8220;At some point you&#8217;re going to end up pushing the limits, which means you have to understand the precise limits&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  In general, we need to minimize the number of rules and caveats to think about.
Any rules and caveats that make staying on track harder are bad for obvious reasons.
But even the ones that try to make it easier require you to think about them. 
That&#8217;s because at some point you&#8217;re going to end up pushing the limits, which means you have to understand the precise limits.
Consider grace periods, three-strikes policies, and generous exemption criteria.
Those, ironically, do not reduce your chances of derailing!
</p>
<p>
  How not? Because they don&#8217;t make the overall goal any easier.
They mostly just add some fuzziness about how far you can push things before you really derail.
Which just means you push a little farther than you would otherwise and end up increasing your chances of derailing.
Better to push it / procrastinate up to a bright, unambiguous red line than to push it / procrastinate up to a line whose exact location is shrouded.
</p>
<p>
  The lesson we&#8217;ve learned (the hard way):
make the goal itself easier, don&#8217;t try to make it easier with various leniencies.
</p>
<h2>
  Catching Back Up Just This Once
</h2>
<p>
  The general rule is that leniencies necessarily backfire.
Sometimes newbees unaccustomed to our hard-assery will balk at a derailment that they view as still recoverable.
But catching back up &#8220;just this once&#8221; is, like, defeating ze whole point of ze commitment device.

  If that&#8217;s even a possibility in your head then we can predict failure with pretty high confidence.
The problem with that mentality is that you
  <em>
    may
  </em>
  catch up once or twice, but each catch-up will take longer until it just never ends up happening.
Which is why, early on, we made it fundamental to the way Beeminder works that you pay the penalty the very day that you cross the bright red line.

<p>
  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is all the rage.
(See, for example, Scott Alexander&#8217;s excellent primer on CBT as a part of
  <a

    title=\\"Scott Alexander of Astral Codex Ten fame also has a psychiatry website with articles like this one\\"
  >
    his article on depression
  </a>
  .) 
 
To explain it, let&#8217;s start with a crude
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.therapistaid.com/therapy-guide/cbt-psychoeducation\\"
    title=\\"A summary of CBT, including the cognitive model\\"
  >
    cognitive model
  </a>
  of human behavior: 
our behavior is the result of our emotional state which, in turn, is created by the thoughts and beliefs we hold about our situation.
</p>
<p>
  <img
    src=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/narthur-cbt-diagram-1.png\\"
    alt=\\"Cognitive model of behavior\\"
  >
</p>
<p>
  The anti-Beeminder view takes that model and claims that the best way to change your behavior is to address your thoughts, rather than trying to change your actions directly. 
If you leave your thoughts unchanged, you&#8217;re likely to continue dealing with the same behavioral problems. 
If you change your thoughts, behavior modification is automatic. 
It&#8217;s the difference between repeatedly cutting the top off of a weed and pulling it up by the roots.
</p>
<p>
  This objection paints Beeminder as an inefficient and needlessly-stressful game of behavioral whack-a-mole &#8212; that it&#8217;s a superficial fix that leaves the source of the problems unaddressed.
Wouldn&#8217;t we rather address the underlying thoughts and emotions that give rise to the behaviors rather than Beeminder&#8217;s approach of just changing the behaviors?
</p>
<p>
  We could try to sidestep the objection by instead beeminding the root issues. 
But Beeminder works best for concrete, quantifiable, controllable metrics. 
Thoughts and emotions are none of those things.
So instead we beemind behaviors &#8212; getting to bed on time, doing our chores, spending less time on Facebook.
</p>
<p>
  And it&#8217;s worse than that, says our hypothetical Beeminder naysayer.
Providing a superficial fix for an internal problem enables denial of the deeper issues. 
Without Beeminder, I would be forced to address the real issues &#8212; my distorted thoughts and beliefs. 
Therefore, I should actively avoid Beeminder and similar tools in order to ensure I do the hard work of addressing the root causes!
</p>
<h3>
  What CBT Actually Says
</h3>
<p>
  The error in that logic is the one-way causal connection between what one thinks and feels and the resulting behavior. 
This isn&#8217;t what CBT teaches. 
CBT states that our thoughts, emotions, and behaviors are tightly interconnected, each influencing the others in an open feedback loop.

</p>
<p>
  Each node in the triangle can impact, and be impacted by, any other node. 
Notice that our behavior has a direct impact on our thoughts and feelings.

<h3>
  Beeminder and Identity
</h3>
<p>
  Beyond thought and emotion, tools such as Beeminder can help us to change our self-perceptions by allowing us to implement habits, which, in turn, provide evidence of our new identities. 
James Clear, author of
  <a
    href=\\"https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits\\"
    title=\\"This book has the narthur seal of approval and is commonly recommended in Beeminder circles\\"
  >
    Atomic Habits
  </a>
  , is a
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChQ9ZGGXpU\\"
    title=\\"James Clear discusses how habits create identity\\"
  >
    proponent of this idea
  </a>
  . 
According to Clear, behaviors, habitually repeated, form our identities.
</p>
<p>
  The opposite of this effect is learned helplessness. 
If we&#8217;ve experienced repeated failure in a certain area, that failure can become a part of our identity. 
We have learned that we are helpless to make progress toward this goal, so we stop trying.
</p>
<p>
  Learned helplessness can sneak up on us when we&#8217;re trying to reinvent ourselves. 
If I want to become a programmer, I may decide to start spending time learning how to code. 
For a few days I may succeed in doing that. 
But then I start hitting more challenging topics. 
It gets frustrating. 
And then an unexpected event comes up and I skip a day. 
And soon I&#8217;ve given up the goal entirely. 
I&#8217;ll likely be hesitant to make another attempt in the future, remembering how helpless I felt the last time I tried.
</p>
<p>
  Beeminder is an incredible tool for moving from learned helplessness to conscious competence. 
Instead of relying on my
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/willpower\\"
    title=\\"Old Beeminder blog post on what willpower is\\"
  >
    willpower
  </a>
  , 
I&#8217;m able to create an external commitment that will keep me on track. 
Each day I meet my goal, I&#8217;m creating evidence that I can become a programmer. 
And eventually I&#8217;ll have enough evidence that I will begin to think of myself as a programmer. 
Programming will have become a part of my identity.
</p>
<p>
  And even if I derail, having a Beeminder goal guards against slipping into learned helplessness. 
Beeminder puts my past progress front-and-center with its cumulative graphs. 
I can visually see all the time I&#8217;ve already spent learning to program &#8212; the evidence is right there, regardless of my recent derailment. 
And the fact that my Beeminder goal is still there, ready to get me back on track after a short break, creates the implicit assumption that I still have what it takes to get back up and keep going towards my goal. 
It&#8217;s subtly hinting that I should view myself as a person capable of growth in the face of setbacks.
</p>
<h3>
  My Experience with Beeminder and CBT
</h3>
<p>
  I&#8217;ve been seeing a CBT therapist for some time now. 
Beeminder has been key to that therapy&#8217;s effectiveness for me. 
Anxiety, depression, and ADHD &#8212; the very problems I needed my therapist&#8217;s help to address &#8212; prevented me from implementing the interventions they recommended. 
Beeminder bridged that gap by giving me an external system I could lean on to help me make the changes I needed to make. 
And it helped me to stick to those changes long enough for them to start having an effect.
</p>
<p>
  For example, my therapist recommended that I keep a thought journal, recording my negative thoughts and challenging them in the moment. 
But without any salient reminder to do this between sessions, I inevitably never did. 
A simple do-more Beeminder goal fixed this by regularly prompting me to watch for negative thoughts to address.
</p>
<h3>
  And the Winner Is&#8230;
</h3>
<p>
  Both! 
The point is, CBT and Beeminder aren&#8217;t in competition at all.
Using Beeminder alongside CBT can produce better results than either alone. 
 
If you&#8217;re seeing a CBT therapist, Beeminder can help you implement the therapy.
If you&#8217;re not, it&#8217;s still worth using CBT&#8217;s ideas.
Beeminder-driven behavior change can bootstrap deeper changes in cognition, emotion, and identity.

  The second most puzzling thing about Beeminder, for those who don&#8217;t use it, is why people don&#8217;t lie to avoid paying us.
Here&#8217;s why!
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Beeminder is foremost a

    </a>
    tool, so it feels really wrong and counterproductive to falsify your data. People take a lot of pride in their graphs since it&#8217;s a meaningful visualization of their progress, and they&#8217;d rather pay the occasional penalty than mess that up.
  </li>
  <li>
    When possible, they use an automatic data source, like connecting a Fitbit to Beeminder, or RunKeeper, or a Withings scale. 
(We list the automatic data sources on the front page of
    <a
      href=\\"http://beeminder.com\\"
      title=\\"For those just tuning in, Beeminder is a self-tracking and commitment tool where you pledge to keep all your datapoints on the right side of a bright red line or (literally) pay the price\\"
    >
      beeminder.com
    </a>
    .)
  </li>
  <li>
    If you link to your graph on your blog or at least send the URL out to friends by email then falsifying your data is like lying to your friends. (Ideally make the data public too &#8212; by default the graph is public but the data private.)
  </li>
  <li>
    We try to encourage people to think of non-weaselliness as part of their identity as a Beeminder user. Like with this excerpt from our FAQ:
  </li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    What makes Beeminder users so honest?
Self-selection! If you were the type who would falsify your data to weasel out of paying what you pledged on your goal then you would&#8217;ve rolled your eyes and walked away several paragraphs ago.

</p>
<ol start=\\"5\\">
  <li>
    Recognize the value Beeminder provides. At the time you fail your goal you will have been forced (by Beeminder) to study for several weeks or months, more than you ever would have without it, so they&#8217;ve probably earned their money by that time.
  </li>
  <li>
    Recognize the power of commitment contracts and realize that you want them to continue to have that power. If you cheat on a commitment contract it&#8217;s much harder to use them in the future.

  I recently-ish had my one-year anniversabee!
I first stumbled upon Beeminder around March 2014, but I went back and forth with myself about whether I should sign up. 
Was I really the type of person who needed to pledge money to strangers to get things done? 
Isn&#8217;t that just sad? 
Couldn&#8217;t I develop some willpower instead? 
(Yes, sometimes; no, I don&#8217;t think so; and no, I could not.) 
Anyway, as you can tell, I signed up, and then I achieved all my goals immediately and lived happily ever after&#8230;
</p>
<p>
  Just kidding. I&#8217;ve derailed plenty. 
In fact, I have paid Beeminder more than $300 for the privilege of its motivation (and $82 for the privilege of pledgeless goals, but more on that later). 
I&#8217;ve paid more in derailments on my Fitbit goal than my Fitbit originally cost. 
Some of my goals have been easy to keep up with, but others have cost me quite a lot.
There have even been cases where I eventually got sick of throwing away money and archived the most expensive failures.
The magical

  Is it just us now?
If you&#8217;ve never been a weasel get out, seriously, you&#8217;re not welcome to this party.
Okay, so, shameful admission time &#8212; I have totally been a weasel to Beeminder before, on all those goals that didn’t work.
</p>
<p>
  &#8220;WHAT!?&#8221; you say. &#8220;YOU ANSWER ALL OUR SUPPORT EMAILS AND REPRESENT AND ADVOCATE BEEMINDER AND YOU ARE IMPURE?!&#8221; 
Yes. It&#8217;s true. 
I have ventured into that dark side, and I have also escaped it and reentered the light. 
And that experience has helped me get even more value out of Beeminder than I did before. 
(Also, it gives me a pretty good idea if you&#8217;re weaseling when you ask me to undo your derailments. You&#8217;re not fooling anyone, weasels! But I&#8217;m still nice to you, because customer service.)

<h2>
  Into The Dark Side
</h2>
<p>
  It probably started really innocently, right? 
You had a goal to do 100 pushups a week, and you were doing pretty good for awhile. 
But one day you were really busy, you didn&#8217;t remember Beeminder, and then you got a zeno polling email while watching Game of Thrones. 
Well, you&#8217;ll definitely do the 15 pushups later tonight. 
You&#8217;ll just enter the data now while you&#8217;re thinking about it, but you&#8217;ll definitely do them before bed. 
Not just yet though &#8212; you&#8217;re in the middle of Game of Thrones.
Except you forget, and you
  <em>
    don&#8217;t
  </em>
  do it before bed.
And the next day is another eep day, and you already owe 15&#8230; might as well owe 30. 
You&#8217;ll do them. Really. You&#8217;ll

<p>
  Except you never catch up. 
And then you&#8217;re entering the bare min every day just to avoid paying Beeminder the $5 (or $10, or $30&#8230;) but never doing anything. 
After a while, the numbers and graphs are meaningless. 
Beeminder is now a chore (a threat, even) that provides no value. 
Eventually you figure out how to archive or perma-flatline your goal, and you walk away.

  &#8220;Set it up with an autodata integration this time, so you don&#8217;t have to enter data &#8212; you just have to do your goal.&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  Lying to Beeminder is a horrible, slippery slope. 
If you ever do it on one goal, you&#8217;ll always have it as an option in the back of your mind. 
Beeminder loses all its power over you, regardless of the pledge level, because you&#8217;ll think &#8220;well, I can just fudge it.&#8221; 
BAD. Beeminder can be incredibly helpful (though it&#8217;s not the right tool for
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/typebee/\\"
    title=\\"“The Type Bee Personality”\\"
  >
    everybody
  </a>
  ). 
Even if you&#8217;ve been weaselly, it doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t or shouldn&#8217;t use Beeminder.
One reason for weaselliness is that you just didn&#8217;t care about that goal as much as you thought you did.
That&#8217;s a great thing to learn!
Archive it, banish those nagging &#8220;should&#8221; feelings from your mind, and go about your life without regret.
</p>
<h2>
  Reentering the Light
</h2>
<p>
  So let&#8217;s talk unweaseling.
We need to get your faith in Beeminder back!
Here are a few things I&#8217;ve done to drag myself back into the good and pure&#8230;
</p>
<h3>
  1) Hide your past shame
</h3>
<p>
  I think the graphs are even more motivating to me than the pledges. 
A pledge gets me to do the bare min every day, but the graph gets me to do more.
I feel good when all my graphs are green and I&#8217;m jumping up by huge amounts every day. 
I do not feel good when I have 10 red days at once. 
Use the x-min setting to hide your previous weaseled numbers. 
The lies will still be in the past data, but your graph image will be fresh and clean, ready to fill with real data. 
Keep it that way!
  <br>
  (The hardcore version of this is to archive away all your dirty goals and start brand new ones.)
</p>
<h3>
  2) Acknowledge reality
</h3>
<p>
  Now that you have a nice clean graph, let&#8217;s get real about your goal rate. 
Was it truly a one-off bad day that started you on this treacherous path, or was your initial rate maybe a liiiiittle too optimistic? 
(This totally happens to EVERYBODY. Even the founders.) 
Often our initial rates are harder to stick with than we&#8217;d thought &#8212; after all, we had to beemind this goal just to get started doing it! 
So use the road dial to take it down a notch to an amount you
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/wantcanwill\\"
    title=\\"“The Want-Can-Will Test for Akrasia” — in short, if there&#39;s something you absolutely want to do, you definitely can do, but that historically you don&#39;t do, then that&#39;s something you should beemind\\"
  >
    can and will
  </a>
  realistically do. 
Even if that realistic rate is 1 per week, if you were originally doing 0 per week, you&#8217;re coming out ahead.
</p>
<p>
  Again, don&#8217;t be afraid to admit the alternate, but very common, reality: you don&#8217;t actually
  <em>
    want
  </em>
  the goal.
For years I&#8217;ve told myself I should try to finish

    href=\\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=couch+to+5k\\"
    title=\\"There are a plethora of schemes to get you from sitting on the couch to running 5 kilometers (C 2 5k)\\"
  >
    C25K
  </a>
  .
Only recently have I accepted the facts: I despise running, and I do not care about completing C25K.
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"IPSO1\\"
    href=\\"#IPSO\\"
  >
    [3]
  </a>
  If the goal doesn&#8217;t matter to you, archive it!
You can always restart it later if you have a change of heart.
</p>
<h3>
  3) Earn it
</h3>
<p>
  Just because you weaseled in the past and you&#8217;re trying to start over doesn&#8217;t mean you deserve to get off scot-free! 
If you really want to do the thing &#8212; let&#8217;s do it. 
How many pushups did you lie to us about? 
Create a goal to make up for them, and repent for your weaselly sins.
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"BACKLOG1\\"
    href=\\"#BACKLOG\\"
  >
    [4]
  </a>
  And see, we got you to do the pushups you wanted to do originally! 
Aren&#8217;t you proud of yourself?
It&#8217;s like the weaseling never happened.
(But for heaven&#8217;s sake, don&#8217;t weasel on the unweaseling goal.)
</p>
<p>
  Ideally, set it up with an autodata integration this time and get the responsibility for telling Beeminder your numbers out of your weaselly paws.
Check out the current

Or ask in the Beeminder

Odds are at least one of our users has an idea to get your goal as automatic as possible.

<h3>
  4) Make it irrelevant
</h3>
<p>
  After 7 months of beeminding, venturing into Weasel World, and coming out alive the other side, I decided to invest in a
  <a

    title=\\"The Plan Bee section of the blog post introducing premium plans\\"
  >
    Plan Bee subscription
  </a>
  . 
The key benefit for me is the fully pledgeless goal. 
This means you can start every goal at $0, step any goal down to $0, and
  <em>
    cap
  </em>
  any goal at $0 &#8212; potentially making every derailment penalty-free.
Of course, this also makes every goal potentially motivation-free, so be careful!
I still let the pledge schedule climb on the goals that matter most to me, to ensure that I keep making progress.
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"CAPS1\\"
    href=\\"#CAPS\\"
  >
    [5]
  </a>
  But if you&#8217;re more motivated by the graphs than the pledges, Plan Bee might be worth checking out.
</p>
<p>
  Doing things your short-term self doesn&#8217;t want to do is hard.
Beeminder really helps, and I&#8217;m so glad that I found it.
But it&#8217;s
  <em>
    probably
  </em>
  not a silver bullet for every single thing you&#8217;ve ever wanted to do or change about yourself.
(I mean, I&#8217;m eating Doritos as I write this. I&#8217;ve still got some problems I&#8217;d like to solve.)
It&#8217;s taken me a while to figure out how I can best use Beeminder &#8212; and what&#8217;s best for me is
  <em>
    probably
  </em>
  not the same as what&#8217;s best for you.
Try out as many goals as you feel you can handle, but always bee thoughtful about it.
The more you can avoid even
  <em>
    considering
  </em>
  weaseling and

  At this point Danny was still having trouble understanding why you would ever expect to forget to enter pushups later but not forget to do them later.
It&#8217;s like when your mom says &#8220;go clean the table&#8221; and you&#8217;re all &#8220;give me a minute i&#8217;m DOING something gosh&#8221; and then you forget immediately, so she yells at you again 30 minutes later. 
You&#8217;re getting nagging Bee-mom-der off your back by entering data before doing the thing.
(Danny still thinks this is too obvious of a slippery slope to fall for but it sounds like Danny shouldn&#8217;t be reading this far anyway.)

  <a href=\\"http://chirpify.com\\">
    Chirpify
  </a>
  .
</p>
<p>
  You can now add public shame to your derailments!

  >
</a>
First we should explain what Chirpify is all about, if that&#8217;s still necessary.
(They just [raised over a million dollars](http://chirpify.com/news/series-a/ ) and we expect they&#8217;ll soon be a household name). 
Chirpify turns Twitter into a payment platform. 
You connect it to your Paypal account
<a
  class=\\"footnote\\"
  id=\\"PP1\\"
  href=\\"#PP\\"
>
  [2]
</a>
and then you can make payments by tweeting.
Like you can reply to a seller with, simply, &#8220;buy&#8221; and &#8212; bam! &#8212; you&#8217;ve bought what they&#8217;re selling.
Or send an arbitrary payment for any reason by tweeting something like &#8220;pay @alice $123 for parakeet grooming&#8221;.
<p>
  So now if you tell us to use Chirpify for a particular Beeminder contract then your payment to us, should you derail, will be publicly tweeted for all of your followers to see.
Specifically, you&#8217;re authorizing us to tweet on your behalf and you&#8217;re authorizing Chirpify to debit your Paypal account when you tweet the magic words.
Don&#8217;t worry, you can still use a credit card and keep your Beeminder use hush-hush if you like.
And of course we won&#8217;t ever abuse our power to put words in your mouth by tweeting anything else.
</p>
<p>
  Here&#8217;s what it looks like to be publicly humiliated:

  What&#8217;s the most absurdly provocative way I can put this?
Never imagine what your users will want!
Apps must only ever do one single thing!
If-statements considered harmful!
</p>
<p>
  Yes, this is all pretty rich coming from the people who built a goal-tracking app with, if I&#8217;m doing this math right, multiplying out all the various settings&#8230; 
73,728 types of goals.
Not to mention all our reminder settings, pledge settings, ways to schedule breaks, settings for what happens when you derail, no-excuses mode [previously weaselproofing], etc etc etc.
We&#8217;ve learned this the hard way, ok?
Also we&#8217;re exaggerating.
Some settings are great.
And Beeminder is a big beautiful bounteous beast that can do amazing things that we, the creators, have never thought of

  and that&#8217;s wonderful and we&#8217;re very proud.
But there are some important rules of thumb that are counter to a lot of people&#8217;s &#8212; especially programmers&#8217;, especially our own &#8212; instincts.
So listen up!
</p>
<p>
  I know it&#8217;s exciting to imagine far-flung use cases and to try to please as many people as possible but it&#8217;s like Abraham Lincoln says: 
You can&#8217;t please/fool all of them all the time.
If you&#8217;re very sure you&#8217;ve identified genuinely divergent use cases (and that you genuinely want to support both use cases, which

    as a startup you probably don&#8217;t!
  </a>
  ) then
  <em>
    maybe
  </em>
  it&#8217;s ok to add the setting.
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"SHIRK1\\"
    href=\\"#SHIRK\\"
  >
    [2]
  </a>
  My rule of thumb &#8212; and this is a necessary but not sufficient condition &#8212; is to wait for a user to make an impassioned argument for their use case. 
Never add a setting speculatively, i.e., by imagining what a user could want.
Default to total paternalism where
  <em>
    you
  </em>
  decide what the user wants.
</p>
<p>
  Or look at it from a programming perspective.
As you add more settings you increase the number of possible code paths and places for bugs to hide exponentially.
</p>
<p>
  Literally exponentially!
It&#8217;s 2020 and we&#8217;re all clear on what exponential means, right?

  Say your app has a few simple checkboxes as settings and your code needs to work for every combination of them.
Then you add
  <em>
    one more measly checkbox
  </em>
  .
You&#8217;ve just doubled the number of combinations.
I mean, not always.
Maybe your app is pristinely designed and your settings are beautifully orthogonal.
But probably not.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  When debating a design choice, never say &#8220;let&#8217;s make it a setting!&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  Need more reasons?
We have a whole smörgåsbord for you to choose from!
Documentation is much, much easier the fewer settings there are.
Customer support even more so.
And if you add a setting that turns out to be stupid, someone will get attached to it and it will be a

  >
    big ordeal to get rid of it
  </a>
  .
Worst of all, it&#8217;s all too easy to add a setting due to uncertainty about what the right design choice is.
</p>
<p>
  &#8220;I guess we can ship that as long as we include a setting to opt out of it&#8221; 
should be a glaring red flag. 
We&#8217;ve violated this a lot and I suspect we were always dead wrong to do so. 
An especially painful example was when we shipped a now-defining feature of Beeminder that both doubled our revenue and made Beeminder drastically more effective for users.
We called it
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/nwo/\\"
    title=\\"New World Order: Goals No Longer Freeze\\"
  >
    precommit-to-recommit
  </a>
  at the time.
Now we don&#8217;t call it anything because there&#8217;s no such thing as anything but precommit-to-recommit.
But that&#8217;s my point.
At the time we were too timid to ship that &#8212; goals that automatically continue and recommit you when you derail &#8212; without a setting to opt out of it.
Which was a massive thorn in our side and source of complexity, user consternation

  , and technical debt for years.
</p>
<p>
  Here&#8217;s one more reason to eschew settings: they&#8217;re a burden on users.
In &#8220;Chapter 3: Choices&#8221; of Joel Spolsky&#8217;s
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2001/10/24/user-interface-design-for-programmers/\\"

  he argues hilariously against adding settings for most things, focusing on how baffling or obtrusive excess customizability can be.
In a similar vein, see 
Basecamp&#8217;s exhortation to

  &#8221;. 
Your app should not be flexible and agnostic.
It should take sides and have a cohesive vision.

<h2>
  Anti-Settings and Anti-Magic

<p>
  If we wanted to get fancy or philosophical we could say that the Anti-Settings Principle and the
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/magic\\"
    title=\\"Previous Beeminder blog post in this quasi-series\\"
  >
    Anti-Magic Principle
  </a>
  are special cases of a more general principle:
&#8220;try not to let the business logic branch&#8221;. 
Of course, most of the time there&#8217;s no choice (about there being choices). 
That&#8217;s just what the business logic is. 
If X then do Y else do Z, etc etc. 
But, just&#8230; resist it. 
Ask yourself if the business logic inherently must bifurcate or if, at least for the initial implementation, you can take just one of the paths. 
When you come to a fork in the road, do not take it. 
Pick a single tine. 
Bifurcation will bite you.
This also relates to software engineering concepts like premature optimization being the root of all evil, and

  The very existence of that setting (to automatically quit your goal when you derailed) made it seem all shady that the default was to
  <em>
    not
  </em>
  automatically quit.
Nowadays exactly zero

  people are bothered that committing to your goal means committing until you explicitly end it.
It&#8217;s so fundamental to how Beeminder works that it doesn&#8217;t occur to anyone to object.
Quite the opposite: users routinely assume Beeminder is far harsher than it actually is.
&#8220;You can quit or make the goal easier at any time, with one-week notice&#8221; is more generous than people at first expect.
&#8220;You never have to catch back up after derailing because the graph resets from where you went off track&#8221; &#8212; likewise.
People commonly assume that they&#8217;ll be penalized every day until they catch up to the original commitment.
&#8220;And also if you ever go off track for a single day everything comes to a screeching halt until you explicitly opt back in&#8221;
would nowadays sound ridiculous.
As it should. 
But that sure wasn&#8217;t the case when that was a setting!

  Here&#8217;s a question that keeps coming up. To paraphrase,
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Beeminder is great for stuff that needs to happen every day, but for stuff that happens sporadically in large chunks of time, won&#8217;t I quickly run off Beeminder&#8217;s smooth daily ramp?
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Au contraire! Beeminder allows brilliantly for chunkiness of time. 
The key is to make sure you have enough safety buffer days to make it to your next work day. 
So if you are doing your chunk of work for the week and want to make sure that you can last 7 days before doing more, just make sure you have 7 days of safety buffer.
[EDIT: Beeminder now puts the safety buffer front and center with its live countdown-to-derailment timer.]
Let your road be flat for a week initially if you want to make sure you can establish such a safety buffer.

</h4>
<p>
  The beauty of the yellow brick road is that it guarantees that you will maintain the overall average that you want to maintain &#8212; say, 15 hours a week &#8212; while allowing as much flexibility as theoretically possible about when you do it.
In other words, if you go off the yellow brick road, it is necessarily because you have failed to maintain the overall average you said you wanted to maintain. 
Sure you may be able to bring the average back up in your next chunk of work, but we&#8217;re just imposing the constraint that you do it the other way around. 
Get
  <em>
    above
  </em>
  your road when you do the chunk of work, then coast for a while till you&#8217;re in danger and then do your next chunk. 
It&#8217;s fundamentally the same except we&#8217;ve taken away the danger of the slippery slope of getting further and further behind thinking you&#8217;ll make it up with a bigger and bigger marathon chunk of work later.
</p>
<p>
  Convinced? It&#8217;s a basic tenet of Beeminder that you&#8217;ll never lose on a technicality so let us know if you think you have a counterexample!
</p>
<p>
  (It certainly works for us.
Check out the sidebar on this page, &#8220;Eating Our Own Dog Food.&#8221;
You can see that we typically don&#8217;t post until it&#8217;s an &#8220;emergency blog post day,&#8221; as we call it, when we&#8217;re about to drive off the yellow brick road.
As is the case as we type this!
When you&#8217;re reading this, if we hit publish in time, you&#8217;ll see our dot jump above the road again.
That means we have a week or so of safety buffer &#8212; we keep readjusting the steepness of the road depending on the size of our backlog of post ideas &#8212; till the next post is due.)

  Hi Beeminder fans!
Clozemaster is an awesome way to rapidly increase your vocabulary in the language you&#8217;re learning. 
We wanted to learn a lot of vocabulary fast. 
Single word and short phrase flashcard apps like Memrise are great, but often left us wondering how the words we learned were actually used. 
More comprehensive apps like Duolingo are great too, but only take you so far. 
At some point you simply need to learn a lot of vocabulary to get to the next level.
</p>
<p>
  So we built Clozemaster. 
It&#8217;s a game where the objective is to fill in the missing word for thousands of sentences. 
You&#8217;re always learning in context, seeing how words are used, and making associations with other related words. 
The Fluency Fast Track allows you to play through sentences in order of difficulty based on a frequency list for that language, so you&#8217;re constantly progressing. 
You review sentences with our spaced repetition system, can get extra practice at any particular difficulty level, and even cloze-read longer texts. 
Listening practice? Speaking practice? Looking to brush up on challenging grammar? We’ve got you covered. 
You can also learn on the go with the Clozemaster mobile app.

<p>
  We&#8217;re super excited that Clozemaster can now be integrated with Beeminder. 
Practicing a language consistently is the key to progress, and we know Beeminder will help Clozemaster users stay on track and take their language skills to the next level. 
New to Clozemaster? No problem. 
There are extra paid features with Clozemaster Pro, but you can sign up and play for free. 
Over 50 languages, thousands of sentences, and now Beeminder integration? 
You&#8217;ll bee fluent in no time.

Well sometimes it would get stuck and never stop doing that.
Especially if it&#8217;s happening mostly to new users, they have no sense of that being a bug vs the server just being super slow or something.
So it&#8217;s highly unlikely to get reported despite causing huge inconvenience for lots of people.
</p>
<p>
  The point is, when a user complains about something, think about how likely it would be that that problem would cause a user to complain.
The lower it is the bigger the emergency you might have on your hands.
</p>
<h2>
  Case study 2: Spamboxed email, or, ninja cockroaches
</h2>
<p>
  So now imagine a user tells you that an email you sent wound up in their spam folder.
This is like spotting the kind of cockroach breed that spends decades being trained by a giant anthropomorphic rat.
We may be taking the analogy way too far.
The point is, how can someone complain about something that didn&#8217;t happen?
It&#8217;s pure luck that they checked their spambox and knew to complain!
Pretty much everyone else won&#8217;t.
So email failure is about the cockroachiest bug ever.
</p>
<p>
  Remember the rule of thumb about supporting a blue whale&#8217;s worth of cockroach biomass?
Well after sending a mass email last week (our so-called monthly beemail) we in fact got two independent reports from users about needing to fish it out of spam.
</p>
<p>
  True confession:
This was probably our fault (we&#8217;re still scrambling to find out for sure) because the first 5,000 or so emails went out with broken unsubscribe links.
We did fix it quickly (and retroactively) so we don&#8217;t think too many people would&#8217;ve noticed but it might not take many people marking us as spam (which of course they&#8217;ll justifiably do if our dang unsubscribe link doesn&#8217;t work!) before email providers start penalizing us.
</p>
<p>
  Fingers crossed that we don&#8217;t have to burn our Mailgun account to the ground and start over with a fresh IP address for sending email.
And a plaintive plea to our faithful readers: if you could search your spam folder for Beeminder email and mark it Not Spam, that could be a huge help to us.
</p>
<p>
  <br>
  &nbsp;
  <br>
</p>
<h2>
  Selection bias
</h2>
<p>
  One more admonition before we get back to debugging our email woes, since it&#8217;s related to the cockroach principle.
Be careful about straw polls of your users!
Selection bias means you&#8217;ve filtered out all but the sufficiently tolerant or sufficiently lucky to still be hanging around willing to tell you about your crappy software.
(Also, people are way too nice.)
</p>
<p>
  Don&#8217;t get us wrong, straw polls are wonderful &#8212; we do them all the time &#8212; as long as you keep that in mind.
Like if even the people willing to take your straw poll say that something&#8217;s a problem then you know that among your full userbase it&#8217;s a massive problem.
</p>
<p>
  So, brave readers who&#8217;ve made it to the end of this blog post, how&#8217;s Beeminder been beehaving for you?
</p>
<p>
  UPDATE: 
We&#8217;re taking a bit of flak for comparing our users to cockroaches but
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.quora.com/Why-does-beeminder-use-an-analogy-to-describe-users-as-cockroaches\\"
    title=\\"I totally stand by the analogy, btw, and, no, we can&#39;t analogize the software bugs with cockroaches rather than users. The idea is that, for a given bug, hearing from a couple users means there are many more who aren&#39;t speaking up. Although, ironically, from the users&#39; perspective it&#39;s in fact the bugs that are the cockroaches: seeing one or two bugs is good evidence that there are many, many more under the surface waiting to bite you.\\"

  You&#8217;re probably here because you either know and love Beeminder, or you&#8217;re a fan of CodeCombat.

  What&#8217;s special about Beeminder is that we combine Quantified Self &#8212; i.e., self-tracking data collection and visualization &#8212; with commitment contracts.
If you don&#8217;t know anything about commitment contracts, it works like this with Beeminder:
We plot your progress on a graph and represent your commitment as a literal bright red line.
If you cross that line, we charge you money.
Long-time Beeminder users find that those stings (get it?) are well worth it for all the awesomeness we induce the rest of the time.
But if the thought of having to pay money is too scary, that&#8217;s perfect: 
you&#8217;ll be very motivated to keep all your datapoints above the red line.

  You write code to get your character through levels and collect gems and armor and magical items and XP.
It&#8217;s fun and edifying and brilliantly done.
It&#8217;s targeted at kids but don&#8217;t let that turn you off.
The levels eventually get extremely advanced and we absolutely recommend CodeCombat to anyone who wants to learn to code.

  Our son, Cantor (age 12), has been beta-testing the CodeCombat/Beeminder integration for a while (and been using CodeCombat for years before that) and has racked up over a 100,000 XP:

<h3>
  Getting Started
</h3>
<p>
  Here&#8217;s how to get one of those of your very own.
</p>
<p>
  Sign up for both Beeminder and CodeCombat, of course.
Note your CodeCombat username.
Then create a new goal on Beeminder and click the CodeCombat logo.
You&#8217;ll see a little overview page of how the integration works and then a screen like this:

  >
</p>
<p>
  Fill that in and you&#8217;re off to the races.
You&#8217;ll never have to do anything on Beeminder.
Just go earn more CodeCombat XP when Beeminder yells at you!

but don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s special about Beeminder, the secret is that we combine Quantified Self with commitment contracts.
That means that (1) if you&#8217;re a lifehacking data nerd you&#8217;re going to adore us to pieces and 
(2) you can make commitment contracts that are based on data and

  If you don&#8217;t know anything about commitment devices, it works like this with Beeminder:
We plot your progress along a Yellow Brick Road to your goal and if you go off track, we charge you money.
Long-time Beeminder users find that those stings (get it?) are well worth it for all the awesomeness we induce the rest of the time.

We don&#8217;t even ask for a credit card until the first time you go off track.

  The big picture is that Beeminder helps you stick to things that would otherwise get trampled underfoot by the rest of your life.

Unless you hard-commit to making steady progress.

  So far there&#8217;s exactly one thing you can (automatically) beemind on Code School: number of Code School points.
You earn Code School points for every question you complete, approximately 250 points per question.
Lessons are typically 6-8 sections of 3-10 questions each, so at least 5,000 points.
If you want to be certain to complete, say, one lesson each week, then you&#8217;d enter 5000 in the

The only catch is that since we look at your report card, you&#8217;ll have to make that public.

  </a>
  .
What if you find that 5,000 points per week is too hard, or too easy?
Simply adjust the steepness of the yellow brick road at any time using the Road Dial below your graph.
Any changes you make take a week to take effect so you can change your mind about what you&#8217;ve committed to but you can&#8217;t change it out of laziness (unless you&#8217;re particularly forward-thinking about your laziness).
You can also schedule vacations or, if you&#8217;re feeling particularly ambitious, throw away any excess safety buffer you may have accumulated getting ahead of your yellow brick road.
</p>
<p>
  Beeminder will automatically update your graph from Code School, so once it&#8217;s set up, just keep gobbling up Code School points as usual.
The Beeminder email/sms bot (or smartphone app) will warn you if you&#8217;re veering off the yellow brick road.

    title=\\"Or just email support@beeminder.com\\"

    let us know

Not that we have a solution yet, but we could oauth this puppy if there&#8217;s enough demand for that.
Personally we think just making your report card public is a perfect solution, but we&#8217;re gluttons for every possible commitment device, including public accountability.

<p>
  We&#8217;re slightly behind for the traditional September start date, but it&#8217;s not too late!
The semester at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine started on 2nd October, and (thanks to Beeminder!) I got started back on my studies toward my distance learning MSc already.
</p>
<p>
  I don&#8217;t know about any of you, but whenever the new school year starts it feels like a good time to make some resolutions. 
My life has run from academic year to academic year almost without pause since I was five years old (and now I&#8217;m 34!), so maybe it&#8217;s only natural that in some ways it&#8217;s more of a &#8220;New Year&#8221; moment than the day the calendar rolls over.
</p>
<p>
  Which got me thinking about the Beeminder goals I wish I&#8217;d had back when I first attended university in person (shoutout to any other alumni of Cardiff University).
  <br>
  The stuff that might&#8217;ve helped me make the most of it. 
The stuff that might&#8217;ve cemented me in some good habits forever, but also the stuff that would&#8217;ve helped me just&#8230; enjoy the heck out of my time there.
</p>
<p>
  So without further ado, here are the fruits of that thinking: the five goals I wish I&#8217;d had at university.
</p>
<h2>
  A studying goal
</h2>
<p>
  I know, we&#8217;re really starting with the obvious here. 
(And I actually have a whole blog post on just 
this &#8212;
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/study/\\"
    title=\\"Now two years old but we stand by it!\\"
  >
    Nicky&#8217;s Secret To Beeminding Studying: It&#8217;s About Time
  </a>
  !)
But I&#8217;m serious!
</p>
<p>
  I barely knew how to study by the time I landed at university, and I definitely wasn&#8217;t managing my time well.
When they told me I should be spending X hours a week on the reading and X hours a week on extra research, it went in one ear and out the other. 
If I&#8217;d had a Beeminder goal&#8230;
</p>
<p>
  I think if I were to go back and set one up for myself aged nineteen, I&#8217;d pick a simple time-based one, linked with
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/toggl\\"
    title=\\"Blog post introducing our Toggl autodata integration\\"
  >
    Toggl
  </a>
  (if that had existed yet). 
The nice thing about a time-based goal is that
  <em>
    how
  </em>
  you fill the time is flexible: 
I could&#8217;ve spent it doing the reading, 
I could&#8217;ve included the time I spent talking to my personal tutor, 
the time in lectures, 
and the time spent doing extra research. 
I&#8217;d have had a clear idea of my progress and the effort I was managing to put in. 
Maybe it&#8217;d have been a wake-up call when it became obvious I wasn&#8217;t putting in enough time!
</p>
<p>
  I think it&#8217;s important with studying to think about what your needs are exactly: 
these days I use both a time-based goal and a goal that gets a +1 whenever I finish a section.
That one flat-lines most of the week and then jumps up at the end of the week to ensure I finish sections by certain deadlines. 
That&#8217;s important now because my study is self-directed, but maybe not so useful back then. 
Roll with what you actually need, and be ready to change if it&#8217;s not working out.

<h2>
  A budgeting goal
</h2>
<p>
  I went to university with big plans about how I was going to manage my money. 
I didn&#8217;t stick to
  <em>
    any
  </em>
  of them&#8230;
</p>
<p>
  I don&#8217;t think it needs to be fancy, but if I could go back in time, I&#8217;d hook myself up with You Need A Budget (YNAB) sooner, plus a goal to reconcile all my transactions every day. 
Even without YNAB, I think a goal that pushes you to really
  <em>
    look
  </em>
  at what you&#8217;re spending, and plan out what you&#8217;re saving for and what ready money you have around in case of need, is completely invaluable. 
University would&#8217;ve been a great time to learn that skill, especially since it was a time of big temptations &#8212; white hot chocolate at Shot in the Dark every night, anyone? 
Though that café is gone now. 
Boo!
</p>
<h2>
  A goal for keeping in touch with people back home
</h2>
<p>
  Sure, independence is lovely. 
And I wish I&#8217;d taken even more full of advantage of it, rather than mostly just realising I could read
  <em>
    all day
  </em>
  and no one could stop me. 
(Not that I regret that realisation either.) 
All the same, it&#8217;s easy to lose touch with people from pre-college life on a university campus.
I made a Beeminder goal during the pandemic to contact &#8212; five times a week &#8212; any of a set of people I wasn&#8217;t already regularly speaking to before the goal&#8217;s creation. 
I&#8217;ve had some great conversations because of it, rekindled a friendship, and generally just made my life quite a lot better. 
All from one Beeminder goal that doesn&#8217;t even take that much time to complete!
</p>
<p>
  If I&#8217;d had that back when I was at university, I&#8217;d have kept in touch with the people I grew up with a bit better, and maybe I&#8217;d have felt a bit more grounded and supported when things went wrong, too. 
Among all the new stuff, it can help to remember that the people back home have your back.

<h2>
  A goal for trying new things
</h2>
<p>
  University is a great time to just figure out who the heck you are and what you like. 
I was living away from my parents for the first time, 
setting my own schedule, 
choosing my own food, 
all of that. 
I wish that I&#8217;d pushed myself to be a bit more adventurous then, and say yes to a few more outings, done a few more silly things, joined one of the clubs&#8230; 
I don&#8217;t regret much about my life, and I had fun reading books in my room, but I&#8217;m sure there are people and experiences I missed out on. 
(Why oh why did I never sign up for the choir?!)
</p>
<p>
  Plus, it&#8217;d have been a great time to learn to cook with no one around to scrutinise my mistakes or fix it for me if things went wrong. 
If I&#8217;d just tried one new recipe a week, that would&#8217;ve been a great outcome.
</p>
<p>
  Depending on your temperament, maybe this goal would be better phrased as a goal for doing something brave &#8212; goodness knows it&#8217;d have taken all the courage I had to audition for the choir!
</p>
<h2>
  A goal for making healthy choices
</h2>
<p>
  It&#8217;s never too late for this one; 
I created one a few months ago and it&#8217;s going great so far!
</p>
<p>
  Just imagine the cumulative effect of changing your mind and picking a healthy option instead of a greasy takeout, 
and taking a walk instead of watching TV all night, 
and going to bed an hour earlier rather than sitting around not doing much. 
That&#8217;s what my new goal is for:
to instill a habit of at least
  <em>
    reflecting
  </em>
  before I make a choice, at least once a day.
</p>
<p>
  Here&#8217;s the note I&#8217;ve set for myself on that goal:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    &#8220;Healthier choices can mean all kinds of things, but for the purposes of this goal we&#8217;re talking about physical health. 
So I would be making a healthier choice when I choose to eat yoghurt or nuts instead of a bag of potato crisps; 
I&#8217;d be making a healthier choice by choosing to go for a walk over lunch instead of playing FFXIV the entire time. 
Healthy choices can be small, barely impactful in the short-term &#8212; but cumulatively, if I&#8217;m making at least one healthier choice per day, that&#8217;s a lot more healthier choices.
However, it&#8217;s not a healthier choice if I was going to do it anyway. 
If I&#8217;m heading to the kitchen specifically to grab a yoghurt for breakfast, that&#8217;s not a healthier choice, that&#8217;s the choice I was making anyway.&#8221;
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  I&#8217;ve set the rate to 1/day &#8212; but I&#8217;m using Nathan Arthur&#8217;s

  to put my feet to the fire.
</p>
<p>
  Man, if I&#8217;d set that up back in university&#8230;

<h2>
  How about you?
</h2>
<p>
  I&#8217;m sure these aren&#8217;t the only goals that would&#8217;ve been useful to me back in university. 
I could definitely have used Beeminder back when I was training for a 5k charity run, for example! 
But these
  <em>
    specific
  </em>
  five goals are ones I really wish I&#8217;d set back then, because I think they&#8217;d have helped me make the most of it. 
Not that I want you to think I did badly, or that I didn&#8217;t love university &#8212; Cardiff University was a great place to be, I had great friends, and a great time. 
(And I won&#8217;t be falsely modest: I got great grades, too.)
</p>
<p>
  But maybe I could&#8217;ve made even more of it, with a little push.
</p>
<p>
  What about you? 
Are there goals you wish you could go back in time and set up for yourself at college? 
Or maybe you
  <em>
    are
  </em>
  at college, and you have indispensable Beeminder goals that already get you through your day? 
We&#8217;re eager to hear, and maybe I&#8217;ll be stealing your ideas&#8230;

    I&#8217;ve been trying to get myself out of my comfort zone more often
  </a>
  . I&#8217;ve been finding it&#8230; uncomfortable.
</p>
<p>
  One thing I&#8217;ve been trying to do is talk to strangers more frequently. I genuinely want to get better at this. I think it will make me more comfortable socially as well as being a valuable skill generally. But every time I think about approaching a stranger in the street, my brain starts coming up with reasons that it&#8217;s a bad idea.
</p>
<p>
  It struck me that this problem is an instance of akrasia. Stepping outside of my comfort zone might be beneficial in the long run, but there&#8217;s a short-term cost: being uncomfortable. What do I do to overcome akrasia? I use Beeminder!
</p>
<p>
  There are a number of different reasons that pushing yourself out of your comfort zone is so difficult, and I think Beeminder is well designed to help with many of these. Here&#8217;s some of what I&#8217;ve learnt so far about pushing yourself out of your comfort zone, and how Beeminder can help:
</p>
<h2>
  Make your goals concrete
</h2>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;Part of the problem is that &#8216;getting outside of your comfort zone&#8217; is just way too vague a goal &#8212; it&#8217;s not an action you can complete straight away.&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  It&#8217;s all too easy to say you want to get outside of your comfort zone more often, but never follow through with it. I know that I&#8217;ve done this plenty of times in the past. Part of the problem here is that &#8220;getting outside your comfort zone&#8221; is just way too vague a goal. It&#8217;s not an action you can take right away. If your goals aren&#8217;t actionable, they&#8217;ll never get done &#8212; because you&#8217;ll never start. If you want to achieve any goal &#8212; uncomfortable or not &#8212; you first need to break it down into concrete tasks, with clear conditions for success.
</p>

    title=\\"How Beeminder goals jibe with the S.M.A.R.T.(E.R.) criteria\\"
  >
    Beeminder forces you to do this
  </a>
  . 
If you want to beemind doing things outside of your comfort zone, you need to have a clear sense of which actions count and which don&#8217;t. These can be however big or small &#8212; you might have a goal of talking to a stranger a certain number of times per week, or going to a certain number of new things every month, for example. The important thing is making it concrete.
</p>
<h2>
  Progress isn&#8217;t an excuse to slack off
</h2>
<p>
  After a few months of trying to do more things outside of my comfort zone, I realised I had a problem: although I was pushing myself to do challenging things, I didn&#8217;t actually feel like I was getting much more comfortable with anything. I think it was because I was only doing any given thing once, and then moving on to a new challenge. Without repeated exposure, my confidence in doing any particular thing wasn&#8217;t increasing.
</p>
<p>
  One thing I&#8217;d been finding uncomfortable was going into the free weights room in the gym. My problem wasn&#8217;t motivating myself to exercise but that, as a fairly petite girl, I felt intimidated going into a room packed with sweaty, muscular men. So I avoided it. One day
  <a
    href=\\"http://jesswhittlestone.com/blog/2013/11/9/not-belonging\\"
    title=\\"&#39;Not Belonging&#39; from Jess&#39;s blog gives the whole story\\"
  >
    I managed to overcome this discomfort and just go in there
  </a>
  , which felt like a great achievement. But the next time I went to the gym I found myself thinking &#8220;well, you went in there last time &#8212; maybe it&#8217;s ok to let yourself off this time.&#8221; It was weeks before I went in again.
</p>
<p>
  I realised that I was essentially
  <a
    href=\\"http://jesswhittlestone.com/blog/2013/11/28/noticing-progress-helpful-or-harmful\\"
    title=\\"&#39;Noticing Progress -- Helpful Or Harmful?&#39; on Jess&#39;s blog\\"
  >
    using my success as an excuse to slack off
  </a>
  . As a result, I wasn&#8217;t getting much closer to my real goal of being comfortable in the free weights room.
</p>
<p>
  Of course, breaks and rewards when you make progress towards a goal can be incredibly beneficial. But it&#8217;s easy to slip into slacking off, which isn&#8217;t helpful. Having a clear goal with a yellow brick road leading towards it is a great way to avoid this. If you make progress and get yourself above the road, you can reward yourself with some time off &#8212; but this reward period is limited. Soon you&#8217;ll  be under pressure to get going again. So if you talk to a stranger today, maybe you can chill out tomorrow &#8212; but you&#8217;ll have to talk to someone again the next day.
</p>
<h2>
  Notice yourself making excuses
</h2>
<p>
  Sometimes I&#8217;d tell myself I was going to do something outside of my comfort zone, but when it came down to it
  <a
    href=\\"http://jesswhittlestone.com/blog/2013/10/22/making-excuses\\"
    title=\\"&#39;Making Excuses&#39; on Jess&#39;s blog\\"
  >
    I&#8217;d manage to come up with a whole load of excuses to put it off
  </a>
  . It took me a couple of tries to actually go to a Toastmasters meetup, for example. The problem, I realised, was telling the difference between good reasons not to do something &#8212; like serious illness &#8212; and mere excuses.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;Do you feel ill enough that you’d rather pay $5 than have to go out and socialise with people you don’t know?&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  One solution to this is to precommit to only being able to back out in exceptional circumstances. If you think about what a valid excuse is in advance, then you can&#8217;t just weasel your way out at the last minute. If you need ultimate precommitment (so that only a doctor&#8217;s note or similar will suffice), Beeminder lets you do this with the &#8220;weasel-proof me&#8221; check-box. Having money at stake also helps a lot, because it provides a way to value your excuses. Ok, you feel ill &#8212; do you feel ill enough that you&#8217;d rather pay $5 than have to go out and socialise with people you don&#8217;t know?
</p>
<p>
  Sometimes having money on the line just makes things simpler, too &#8212; especially if it&#8217;s a lot of money. If you&#8217;re going to lose $100 if you fail to do something, you basically leave yourself with very little choice &#8212; which means no agonising over whether your excuses are good ones. In a way, I find this

    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/beenice/\\"
    title=\\"&#39;Be Nice To Yourself&#39; by Bethany Soule on the Beeminder blog\\"
  >
    can sometimes feel quite liberating
  </a>
  . Often the worst part of doing something uncomfortable is agonising with yourself about whether to do it or not. When you
  <em>
    have
  </em>
  to do something &#8212; whether you&#8217;ve created this situation artificially for yourself or not &#8212; it sometimes makes it easier.
</p>
<h2>
  Commit to specific people
</h2>
<p>
  One of the most useful motivational hacks I&#8217;ve found is
  <a
    href=\\"http://jesswhittlestone.com/blog/2014/2/2/make-yourself-accountable\\"
    title=\\"&#39;Make Yourself Accountable&#39; on Jess&#39;s blog\\"
  >
    committing to a specific person to do a specific thing
  </a>
  . If you know you&#8217;ve got someone personally holding you accountable, it&#8217;s much harder to weasel out.
</p>
<p>
  One thing that was on my list of comfort zone challenges right from the start was going and
  <a
    href=\\"http://jesswhittlestone.com/blog/2014/2/9/dining-alone\\"
    title=\\"&#39;Dining Alone&#39; on Jess&#39;s blog tells the full story\\"
  >
    having dinner in a restaurant alone
  </a>
  . For me, there&#8217;s something highly uncomfortable about doing things that would normally be done with other people, alone. I&#8217;d probably never have done it if I hadn&#8217;t committed to a friend to do it by a certain date. But like pledging money, this commitment made it much easier, by turning a choice into something I just had to do. And I actually quite enjoyed it in the end!

  </a>
  means you can make yourself accountable to your friends and family as well as the Beeminder Bot. I think this helps a lot. I feel much worse derailing on my goals if I know someone else is going to find out too.
</p>
<h2>
  Take gradual steps
</h2>
<p>
  One of the best known ways to overcome fear is using
  <a href=\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_therapy\\">
    exposure therapy
  </a>
  : 
start by doing something that scares you just a tiny bit, and work up from there. Rather than jumping into the deep end, taking small steps seems to work because each stage is doable, but you still gradually progress towards your goal.
</p>
<p>
  I&#8217;ve found this kind of approach really helpful for expanding my comfort zone. I&#8217;ll start with something that makes me just slightly uncomfortable, but is totally doable: smiling at a stranger, say. Once that becomes easy, I&#8217;ll move on to something a bit harder, like striking up a conversation.
</p>
<p>
  Beeminder provides a really nice way to track and visualise a graded exposure approach. I set a goal for talking to strangers, but with the condition that each datapoint had to correspond to a slightly harder challenge than the last, which helped ensure I actually did keep pushing myself.
</p>

  Don&#8217;t forget to ask why

  Sometimes you&#8217;ll derail. I actually derailed on the goal I just mentioned: my talking to strangers goal. At first, I felt really discouraged and despondent. But when I talked to a friend about my failure, he asked me why I thought I&#8217;d struggled. And it suddenly struck me that I didn&#8217;t really know, but that it was an important question for me to answer.
</p>
<p>
  Derailing on a Beeminder goal is really useful feedback. It&#8217;s an opportunity to ask why: why did I fail to do what I set out to do? Is it just because the pledge I had wasn&#8217;t motivating enough? If so, you can start again. But it might also be that there&#8217;s a stronger underlying reason that you don&#8217;t want to do the thing.
</p>
<p>
  Asking &#8220;why&#8221; seems especially important when it comes to pushing yourself outside of your comfort zone. A lot of the discomfort we feel holds us back. But sometimes, your comfort zone is there for a reason &#8212; embarrassing yourself publicly on a regular basis might well end up having negative consequences! You don&#8217;t want to just keep pushing through your discomfort without thinking about why it might be there.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    To summarise
  </strong>
  : I think that pushing yourself to do things outside of your comfort zone can be a really valuable activity. But it&#8217;s not easy, for similar reasons as why eating healthily or exercising regularly isn&#8217;t easy. Beeminder is a really great tool for helping to make comfort zone expansion easier, because it helps you to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Be really specific about what you want to achieve
  </li>
  <li>
    Reward yourself for making progress, without allowing you to slip off track
  </li>
  <li>
    Prevent last-minute excuses
  </li>
  <li>
    Make yourself accountable to specific people
  </li>
  <li>
    Start small, and progress to bigger challenges
  </li>
  <li>
    Think about
    <em>
      why
    </em>
    you really find something uncomfortable.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  I&#8217;m still experimenting with this myself, so if anyone else tries using Beeminder for these kinds of challenges, I&#8217;d be really interested to hear how you find it!

    (Abstract:
I’ve made it a strict personal rule that every time I utter a statement starting with &#8220;I will&#8221; to someone, no matter how casually, I log the commitment, with a due date, and keep track of when I follow through. 
Using a highly over-engineered formula, I turn all that data into a single reliability metric. 
It&#8217;s roughly measuring the probability that any given “I will” statement I make will turn out to be true. 
But it also accounts for it being
    <em>
      kinda
    </em>
    true &#8212; when I do follow through but not by the deadline I specified.)

<p>
  Hi, I’m Daniel Reeves, cofounder of Beeminder!
This talk is
  <em>
    mostly
  </em>
  not about Beeminder but the common theme is committing to things.
First, in case you don’t know about Beeminder, it&#8217;s a tool for ongoing, usually open-ended, quantifiable commitments. 
Like 
getting 10,000 steps per day as measured by a Fitbit or 
40 hours per week on your job as measured by RescueTime, or 
staying under 100kg as measured by your Withings scale. 
Or even number of to-do items marked done in Habitica, or 
messages in Gmail. 
Beeminder has dozens of integrations with other Quantified Self tools and less QS-y apps that generate data about you incidentally.
</p>
<p>
  (Oh yeah, and the commitment part is that you put in a credit card and agree to get charged if you don&#8217;t keep all your datapoints on track toward your goal every day.)
</p>
<p>
  But what if you want to commit to a specific one-time thing, like 
&#8220;I will send in the slides for this talk”? 
I noticed that I casually make &#8220;I will&#8221; statements a lot. 
Like 
&#8220;I&#8217;ll see if I can reproduce that bug” or 
&#8220;I&#8217;ll let you know if I can make it to the meetup&#8221; or 
&#8220;I&#8217;ll send you the photos&#8221;.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  Pr(dreev does X | dreev says he’ll do X) = 0.968799
</h4>
<p>
  It was really bugging me that my future-tense statements could sometimes be falsehoods. 
So I contrived this system so that instead of making a potentially false statement about what I&#8217;ll do I can instead, impeccably truthfully and more informatively, always give an exact probability that I&#8217;ll do the thing. 
My current reliability for doing what I say is about 97%.
</p>
<p>
  Before I explain that, let me give some more background.
</p>
<p>
  If you know much about the behavior change literature then you&#8217;ll have heard of implementation intentions, or the much simpler term: trigger-action plans. 
Here&#8217;s one I&#8217;m proud of: 
Any time I hear myself saying I should do something 
(&#8220;I should write more code&#8221;, 
&#8220;I should run a marathon someday&#8221;, etc) 
then I take some tiny immediate action that makes the thing more likely to happen.
</p>
<p>
  That&#8217;s been working well for me for years, mostly with the effect of me not making &#8220;should&#8221; statements in the first place and instead rephrasing them like 
&#8220;it might be a good idea to do X but&#8230;&#8221; 
and then listing the costs or downsides. 
I feel like this is still a win, if only because it makes me feel less guilty about all the things I &#8220;should&#8221; be doing but aren&#8217;t.
</p>
<p>
  Last year I had the idea to do something similar with &#8220;I will&#8221; statements. 
I started with the following trigger-action plan: 
Anytime I heard myself make an &#8220;I will&#8221; statement (even the most casual &#8220;cool, I&#8217;ll take a look”) I had to explicitly mention a deadline, calendar it, and add a datapoint to a Beeminder graph.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">

    <br>
    2018: Commits.to (Commit Stew) and promises.to
  </p>
</h4>
<p>
  Initially the Beeminder graph was enforcing that I fulfill 8 promises per week. 
No stipulation of the denominator, just that I fulfill 8 per week.
</p>
<p>
  That Beeminder graph is still going. 
But astute observers will notice a few things about it. 
For one, I backed off from that 8/week and have averaged just over 5/week overall. 
But more interestingly, there are 364 promises logged here 
(actually a few less than that because of dummy datapoints each time I derailed and paid Beeminder money) 
but I only have credit for 348.3 of them. 
What&#8217;s up with that?
</p>

</p>
<p>
  Funny you should ask. 
When I started tracking this I soon realized that although fundamentally I care about the probability, or fraction of commitments fulfilled, I needed a way to quantify fulfilled-but-late. 
And I wanted to distill it all into a single metric for reliability, because that&#8217;s the whole point. 
So this is what I came up with. 
I figured if I missed a deadline by mere seconds, that 99.999% counts. 
If I missed it by some minutes, that still 99.9% counts. 
Hours late isn&#8217;t a big deal, that almost fully counts (99%). 
Days late is like, well, it got done, that&#8217;s the main thing. 90%. 
Being weeks late kind of half defeats the point so that&#8217;s 50% credit. 
Months late mostly doesn’t count. 10%. 
And years is like, better late than never, but barely (1%).
</p>
<p>
  <img

    width=\\"100%\\"

</p>
<p>
  So the real nerdery is in defining this function for exactly how much credit you get as a function of how late you are. 
There are three properties we need: 
One is strict monotonicity, meaning that you always see your reliability score visibly ticking down second by second whenever you have an overdue commitment. 
Two is that it asymptotically approaches zero. 
You&#8217;ll always get some epsilon of credit for fulfilling a commitment no matter how late you are. 
And the clever beehavioral-economic property is that there are sudden drops at every

    title=\\"Beeminder blog post defining the concept of Schelling fences, by Scott Alexander of Slate Star Codex\\"

  </a>
  . 
We don&#8217;t want you to feel like, once you&#8217;ve missed the deadline, that another hour or day or week won&#8217;t matter.
That&#8217;s a slippery slope to never finishing ever. 
I can come back to this if people have questions about it but you don’t need to grok this to understand the rest of the system.

  <h2>
    <code>
      alice.commits.to/send_bob_edits_by_tomorrow_5pm
    </code>
  </h2>
</center>
<p>
  So how do you actually use it? 
Suppose your name is Alice and your coworker or friend is Bob. 
Whenever Alice says something like &#8220;I&#8217;ll send you my edits tomorrow&#8221;, she types a URL like so.
</p>
<p>
  As in, she literally types that, on the fly, directly to Bob, manually, when she&#8217;s making the commitment to him. 
We&#8217;re assuming they&#8217;re talking by email or Slack or whatever. 
When she or Bob click that URL a commitment is created in the app and an entry is added to Alice&#8217;s calendar and ideally a datapoint is sent to Beeminder. 
The system lets you mark the commitment completed and keeps track of your reliability and shows it off to anyone who follows any
  <code>
    alice.commits.to
  </code>
  link.
</p>
<p>
  Here&#8217;s me telling Steven Jonas that I&#8217;d send him my QS slides:

    src=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/commitsto-steven-jonas-screenshot-that-went-missing.png\\"
  >
</p>
<p>
  I added a note to remind myself that I promised this in an email to Steven. 
And again, the UI here was me literally typing the URL in the email to Steven: 
dreev.commits.to slash send underscore slides etc.
Clicking that link logs the commitment which I can then edit or later mark fulfilled.
</p>
<p>
  And if you visit just dreev.commits.to you&#8217;ll see this &#8212; my gallery of commitments.

  Some quick numbers for myself:

    alt=\\"My Reliability: 96.879%  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Based on 391 commitments  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;+7 that are still pending (due in the future)  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And including 11 (gulp) that are currently overdue [1]&lt;br&gt;(footnote: [1] including, as I type this, my promise to send these slides to the QS folks&#8221;
title=&#8221;My Reliability: 96.879%  &lt;/li&gt;

</p>
<p>
  That’s my reliability based on 391 commitments, plus 7 that don’t count for or against my score because they’re not due yet.
But my reliability is gradually ticking down second by second because I have 10 (11 when I wrote that slide) commitments currently overdue.
</p>
<p>
  Some quick numbers for Commits.to overall: 
We have about 10 active beta users, with a bit over 1000 commitments in the database altogether. 
And we’ve been working on this for exactly a year now.

  It can be relaxing to put faith in a system that ensures you’ll do what you need to when you need to
</h4>
<p>
  I’ve learned a lot from working on this and using it. 
Like in a way it adds stress yet is weirdly relaxing, I think for a similar reason that people find David Allen’s Getting Things Done system relaxing. 
But there are definitely failure modes. 
Of course one lesson, which was part of the point all along, is to promise less. 
Break the habit of saying you’ll do something unless you really mean it. 
Here’s our friend Kim making that point:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    “Commits.to has given me reason to pause before I rattle off an empty promise. 
As a people pleaser, I was in the habit of saying I would do things without a real intention to follow through on those statements in a consistent way. 
Now, I value maintaining my overall reliability instead of my agreeability in the moment.&#8221;
    <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8212; Kim Harrison, second most hardcore beta user
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Another lesson is to promise specifics. 
I’ve been burned by promising things that seemed straightforward but turned out to be ill-defined. 
Better to promise a very concrete first step and then make another promise for the next step if it still makes sense. 
And finally, the idea of commits.to is to be motivated by your reliability score and seeing it tick down when you miss a deadline&#8230; but&#8230; for me anyway, that’s not enough. 
My score has been slipping lately and despite those Schelling fences for the individual scores, each individual score doesn’t contribute much to my overall reliability and so I’m still on a slippery slope. 
Which just means I still need Beeminder, so that’s good.
</p>
<p>
  As with Beeminder, I think it’s only a certain kind of personality who wants to put themself through this kind of thing, but I can only assume that that personality type is overrepresented here. 
This thing is still in closed beta, but if you want to commit to help building it, you can start using it now. 
Just try yourname.commits.to and you’ll either see someone’s gallery of commitments if that name is taken or you’ll see instructions for how to learn more and get involved.

  If you&#8217;re nervous about handing over your credit card number, let us start by solemnly promising that we&#8217;re super trustworthy.
Wait, that&#8217;s exactly what a scammer would say.
Ok, getting more specific: 
We promise you won&#8217;t ever be charged due to any kind of technicality, including confusion about how Beeminder works.
(You won&#8217;t be charged at all if you stick to what you&#8217;re committing to!) 
We&#8217;re pretty sure that 5 minutes of googling around to see all the gushing about us on the internet over the last 7+ years will convince you that that promise is credible.
(And now you&#8217;ve found our blog where you can
  <em>

  get to know us.)
If you can see that a commitment device will work for you in theory, we&#8217;re committed to making it work for you in practice.
So let&#8217;s dive in with what exactly we mean by a commitwall, followed by elaboration on how we got here and why!

  Background and rationale
</h2>
<p>
  We&#8217;ve been gathering feedback about this, somehow, for years and were extremely squeamish about pulling the trigger.
There are a lot of superfans who wouldn&#8217;t have gotten hooked on Beeminder had it required a credit card to try out when they discovered it.
Despite that, we&#8217;re convinced it&#8217;s the right choice.
</p>
<p>
  For the rest of this analysis / navel gazing we&#8217;re intentionally conflating commitwall on signup with commitwall on goal creation.
We actually expect first goal creation will happen as part of signup in the future anyway.
In fact, we

  added a &#8220;give us your email address to stay abreast of the buzz&#8221; form to the front page in anticipation of the commitwall shutting out a lot of people who would&#8217;ve otherwise been game to dabble.

  that &#8220;free trials [have] astonishingly low conversion rates; you need a sophisticated marketing engine harvesting a lot of attention at scale to make these work.&#8221; (He also argues that your really good customers actually feel reassured when you charge real money.)

<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;Beeminding without a credit card is toothless and dumb and is a horrible introduction to what beeminding is supposed to feel like&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  The big downside of the commitwall is losing people who are cautious at first but would&#8217;ve eventually warmed up and paid us. 
(Corresponding upside from a cold-hearted business perspective: losing all the people who would never enter a credit card anyway.
Especially satisfying is filtering out all the spam signups &#8212; also very helpful for data analysis!)
But I think the most important argument for commitwall is that the moment of the person wanting to sign up is an extremely good time to convert them. 
Even with hypothetical perfect lifecycle emails, it&#8217;s hard to top that. 
The one thing we gain by waiting is that later they&#8217;ll have had the chance to try Beeminder. 
That&#8217;s worth it only if we can exceed their expectations. 
But with our years of history and passionate community and nothing but love for us all over the internet, the expectations are hard to top.
</p>
<p>
  Not to mention that beeminding without a credit card is toothless and dumb and is a horrible introduction to what beeminding is supposed to feel like. 
So we predict the probability that we get a credit card only goes down after signing up. 
There are plenty of exceptions but that&#8217;s our prediction in aggregate.
</p>
<p>
  It&#8217;s especially true since, if you only created 1 or 2 goals, the point where we required the credit card was after you first derailed.
It&#8217;s hard to overstate how bad that is.
People &#8212; especially
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/akrasia\\"
    title=\\"Inaugural post on the Beeminder blog\\"
  >
    us akratics
  </a>
  &#8212;
stick our heads in the sand at that point.
Having your goal freeze up on you after your first derailment, until you do something that requires more activation energy, right at a point you&#8217;re feeling frustrated with yourself for first going off track&#8230; that&#8217;s as terrible for users as it is for Beeminder. 
Even worse, it was bewilderingly common for users to not have paid attention and not understood that they didn&#8217;t owe money and weren&#8217;t getting charged when they put in the credit card at that point. 
We made that perfectly clear in the webcopy but, as we keep relearning, users absolutely do not read webcopy.
</p>
<p>
  Now if you derail you get an email asking if the derailment was legit and if you say no, we believe you (unless you weaselproof yourself!).
But the
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/nudge/\\"
    title=\\"Beeminder blog post about an important beehavioral economic insight\\"
  >
    path of least resistance
  </a>
  is now consistently that you get stung, your graph resets, and you&#8217;re back on the hook.
</p>
<p>
  Before this, if you didn&#8217;t hit the commitwall by derailing, you&#8217;d hit it by trying to create your 2nd or 3rd goal.
Whether it was your 2nd or 3rd goal was determined randomly.
(Known as bucket testing, split testing, A/B testing, or a randomized controlled trial.) 
If you think that having more time to try Beeminder helps turn users into customers then you&#8217;d predict that being commitwalled after 2 goals is better than after 1. 
This turned out to not be the case.
The probability you&#8217;ll create a 2nd goal naturally goes down (but only slightly, from 34% to 31%) if we commitwall you after 1 goal. 
But revenue doesn&#8217;t go down detectably at all. 
Of course, commitwall before creating any goals is very different from commitwall after 1 or 2 goals, and it could be worse. 
But we predict it will be better.
</p>
<p>
  The fear and friction of adding a credit card is surprisingly low, we&#8217;ve found. 
In fact, we keep seeing users who are surprised that they hadn&#8217;t already added a credit card, seeming to have presumed that it wouldn&#8217;t have made sense for Beeminder to have let them start beeminding without doing so.
</p>
<p>
  Another advantage of commitwall is that by eliminating the majority of users who won&#8217;t enter a credit card, we can put real human attention on the minority who do. 
And hopefully the ones not ready to scale the commitwall now will want to see emails from us and be gradually convinced to take the plunge.
</p>
<p>
  One more advantage: 
If you find Beeminder frustrating and confusing and haven&#8217;t entered a credit card yet, you&#8217;ll tend to walk away. 
If you find Beeminder frustrating and confusing and you
  <em>
    have
  </em>
  entered a credit card, you&#8217;ll tend to talk to us and become a convert for life.
</p>
<p>
  So, those are our arguments.
(Not counting behind-the-scenes advantages like all the code that can go away now that there&#8217;s no such thing as beeminding sans payment method.)
In short, a sting-free Beeminder isn&#8217;t really Beeminder, and signup is pretty much the best time to convert you into a (potentially) paying customer.
We thought hard about a million alternatives but kept running into the problem that if you derailed before that then the commitwall would still effectively be at the worst possible moment &#8212; as a barrier to getting back on the horse.

  Aherk [was] one of several Beeminder competitors getting a lot of press lately.
Since our last post was singing praises of other trackers, we thought we&#8217;d follow that line to its logical conclusion and catalog other anti-akrasia tools as well.
Here are the others we know of.

In our humble opinion it&#8217;s the most powerful and flexible tool, though it probably has the steepest learning curve.
Its strength is turning any long-term goal for which you can define a graphable metric into a commitment to make steady daily progress.

They&#8217;d keep your money if you fail, which in our opinion only works if you&#8217;re providing a lot of additional value (like, say, by being a great data tracking tool as well as a commitment device!).

    was much more nicely done than Succeed Or Else, and, obviously, focused on weight loss.

Sadly, they closed their doors in 2013.

    </strong>
    (closed its doors sometime in 2013)
we thought of as almost the opposite of Beeminder, rewarding people for reaching goals instead of punishing them for failing to. 
You collected pledges from friends and family who chipped in for some coveted prize if you reached your health-related goal.
We suspect that the typical Beeminder user would balk at the idea of taking up a collection, whereas the typical HealthRally user would just laugh at the idea of paying Beeminder money when they fail.

  Sushi and Green Fields
</h3>
<p>
  It&#8217;s funny how we once thought of it as worrisome to see other startups pursuing our idea.
It&#8217;s so clearly the opposite of worrisome!
The more the merrier!
All these startups are helping each other get the public exposed to commitment devices.
</p>
<p>
  It&#8217;s like my brother who [had] a 
sushi restaurant
 
in central Illinois with one primary competitor in town.
Since most people in town haven&#8217;t even tried sushi, most of the marketing that my brother&#8217;s competitor does is just creating new sushi eaters, some of whom will then presumably eat at my brother&#8217;s restaurant.
Anecdotally, that effect dwarfs any actual customer stealing that the competitor may do.
</p>
<p>
  With Beeminder and StickK and now Aherk and others, it&#8217;s like that but even more so:
99% of the population hasn&#8217;t heard of a single one of us!

My photo isn&#8217;t NSFW or anything.
It&#8217;s not even embarrassing.
Ok, fine, it&#8217;s actually entirely innocuous and I&#8217;m intending to cause it to get released, just to see how that part works.

      to Complice since the beginning.
Complice is quite beautifully done (maybe thanks in part to the more than 600 improvements logged?) and we heartily recommend it.
In this guest post, Malcolm makes the cogent case for the complementarity of Complice and Beeminder.
Not only do they fit philosophically and psychologically, Malcolm has a beautiful integration that lets you beemind many aspects of your complicing.
Whether or not you take the plunge on signing up for Complice, if all this sounds intriguing then come hang out with us in Complice&#8217;s co-working room for Beeminder users!

  What am I doing here on the Beeminder blog talking about my app that sounds like it&#8217;s very similar and probably a direct competitor?
Well you can put down your pitchforks.
Beeminder and Complice are so different, in both philosophy and the details, that they collaborate more than they compete.
</p>
<h2>
  Quantified Self vs
  <em>
    Qualified
  </em>
  Self
</h2>
<p>
  The first obvious difference is that Beeminder is a quantified self app, where Complice is more&#8230; qualified self. 
That is, Beeminder really shines where you can put numbers to your progress. 
Weight loss or gain, doing a certain amount of some activity, or more generally, making a metric go up or down. 
The challenge with this is that these metrics will often either be
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>
      relatively small parts of the overall goal
    </strong>
    &#8212; I can track the number of pomodoros I work towards my business, but there&#8217;s no number of them that guarantees success
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      lagging measures
    </strong>
    &#8212; numbers that are much more tightly correlated with success, but that on a given day I can&#8217;t influence directly&#8230; like revenue.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  For some things, like
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/weight/\\"
    title=\\"Bee&#39;s Guide to Beeminding Weight Loss -- one of many weight loss posts on the Beeminder blog\\"
  >
    losing weight
  </a>
  , 
there are a bunch of other simple habits like eating well and exercising, that can have you basically covered.
</p>
<p>
  But for things like operating a business, you need some way to prioritize all of the individual actions that you&#8217;re going to take and to stay focused on doing the most important ones first. 
This is where Complice shines, because while you still have high-level goals, your progress is measured by
</p>
<p>
  a) how many actions you complete towards that goal each day (where the actions are specific things you enter, many of which will be different each day)
  <br>
  b) a self-assessment: each day, you consider if the way that you approached the goal today would be
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.complice.co/post/112759679057/what-is-enough\\"
    title=\\"People often ask, “well, what does ‘enough’ mean?”
I think about it in a few ways, but the main one is the following: If on all days like this, I did this much, would that be enough to get me where I need to go?\\"
  >
    enough to keep you on track
  </a>
  .
</p>
<p>
  This self-assessment allows you to capture some of the nuances that numbers miss. 
So you might realize that you&#8217;re doing the things you set out to do, but that they&#8217;re not actually getting you much closer to the ultimate goal. This is the kind of thing that you&#8217;ll miss if you&#8217;re
  <em>
    only
  </em>
  tracking actions and not reflecting.
</p>
<p>
  Lest it sound like I&#8217;m just saying &#8220;Complice is better&#8221;, I want to point out that in situations where you
  <em>
    can
  </em>
  use numbers, they have several distinct advantages:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    simplicity
  </li>
  <li>
    ease of entry
  </li>
  <li>
    easier automation
  </li>
  <li>
    nice graphability
  </li>
  <li>
    harder to deceive yourself about
  </li>
  <li>
    easier to quickly compare progress over time
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>
  Hard Accountability vs Soft Accountability
</h2>
<p>
  The other key difference between Beeminder and Complice is that they use different kinds of accountability. 
In
&#8220;
  <a
    href=\\"http://malcolmocean.com/2015/01/structures-of-accountability/\\"
    title=\\"In this post I called hard accountability “Accountability-B” (for Beeminder) and soft accountability “Accountability-C” (for Complice). It also has thoughts on, e.g., horizontal accountability and accountability to self.\\"
  >
    Structures of Accountability
  </a>
  &#8221;
I noted different ways of being accountable. 
Among them were two kinds of accountability I&#8217;m now calling &#8220;hard&#8221; and &#8220;soft&#8221;.
</p>
<p>
  Hard accountability is for things you commit to doing, come hell or high water. 
I either track these with Beeminder, or with a one-off commitment contract with a friend. 
Something where there&#8217;s money on the line. 
But not just money.
As Nick Winter wrote in
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/nick/\\"
    title=\\"Beeminder guest post by Nick Winter about his book, The Motivation Hacker\\"
  >
    Spiraling Into Control
  </a>
  :
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    &#8230;the real cost of failing a goal is not the loss of your Beeminder pledge money. 
It&#8217;s the loss of confidence that you will meet all future goals that you perceive as similar to the current goal. 
You will trust yourself less.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  So for this kind of hard accountability, it&#8217;s critical to keep it, to keep up your sense of &#8220;I&#8217;m serious about keeping to these commitments&#8221;.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;You&#8217;re accountable in the sense that at the end of the day you&#8217;re going to account for what you did&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  Soft accountability, on the other hand, is more tentative. 
Instead of saying &#8220;I commit to doing this,&#8221; you&#8217;re saying &#8220;I commit to seeing if I&#8217;ve done this.&#8221; 
You&#8217;re accountable in the sense that at the end of the day, you&#8217;re going to account for what you did, and you&#8217;re going to
  <em>
    know
  </em>
  if you did or didn&#8217;t do the things you set out to do.
</p>
<p>
  (And as I&#8217;ll describe below, with the Beeminder+Complice integration, you can now put money on the line for
  <em>
    doing this at all
  </em>
  . 
It can be really helpful to have hard accountability about your soft accountability!)
</p>
<p>
  Soft accountability might not sound like much, but it&#8217;s a pretty profound difference from how most people live their lives. 
If you have goals &#8212; things you want to achieve, places you want to be &#8212; then it makes sense to be continually making course corrections to stay on track. 
But you can only do this if you&#8217;re looking at where you&#8217;re going!
</p>
<p>
  I still try to achieve the things I&#8217;m soft-accountable for, but I have enough uncertainty &#8212; about (a) what my day/week looks like, and (b) the value of the task &#8212; that it doesn&#8217;t make sense to put money on the line. 
If I tried to risk money for each of my 8-30 intentions every day, it would take me way too long to decide on them and I&#8217;d have to be really conservative in order to not go broke. 
Instead, I can be slightly optimistic, and then rise to the challenge.
Or not, if my day ends up being spontaneously devoted to something else!
</p>
<p>
  But I&#8217;m adamant about one part: I always assess how I did. 
Each night, I set some intentions for the next day. 
I can&#8217;t yet know if those will actually be the most sensible things to do that day. 
But I know they&#8217;re better than what I&#8217;d end up with if I didn&#8217;t make the list. 
And in order for that list to matter, I need to look at it at the end of the day too, and seriously consider:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Did I do what I intended to?
  </li>
  <li>
    If not, what did I decide to do instead?
  </li>
  <li>
    If I made the same sorts of decisions in the future, would I get where I want to go?
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>
  So Happy Together
</h2>
<p>
  We&#8217;ve established that Beeminder and Complice complement each other when you have both quantitative and more complex progress to be making towards a goal.
</p>
<p>
  There&#8217;s also something good to be said for having both hard and soft accountability in your life. 
Hard accountability is like your drill sergeant or varsity coach, demanding that you drop and do 20 pushups,
  <em>
    <strong>
      now
    </strong>
  </em>
  ;
soft accountability is like a scheduled gym-date with a friend.
You&#8217;ve committed to showing up (or explaining why you didn&#8217;t) and you know your friend will bug you if you flake.
Or something. 
Maybe there&#8217;s a better metaphor. 
But the point is, they play different roles and work well together, with higher-importance stuff being higher-stakes and less flexible, and then more space to be spontaneous around your soft accountability intentions.
</p>
<p>
  Another piece is that because Complice has a general to-do list, you can plan out your day a bit more, which is hard in Beeminder.
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/waterfalls/\\"
    title=\\"the term “Beeminder waterfall” refers to a cascade of Beeminder deadlines that are scheduled to happen one after the other.\\"
  >
    Waterfalls
  </a>
  make this easier, but they only work for things you want to beemind, which isn&#8217;t going to include &#8220;doctor&#8217;s appointment at 2pm&#8221;. 
So if you have a Beeminder goal to run 5km/week, then you might put down &#8220;go for a run before breakfast&#8221; as a fitness action in Complice. 
And then you have a sense of how it fits with the rest of your day, rather than just having a looming sense that at some point you probably should run today.
</p>
<p>
  This to-do list nature also means that you can take care of more process-level or meta-level stuff there. 
So again for this running-5km Beeminder goal, under your fitness goal in Complice you might have an action to go buy new running shoes, or to call your friend to see if they want to run with you some mornings. 
Or to research warmups to do before running.
</p>
<p>
  Even more meta, Complice has built-in weekly reviews, which for me have often been a source of creating new Beeminder goals: 
I realize I&#8217;m not doing enough of some particular action, and then I go set up a Beeminder goal for it. 
You can also use the reviews to reflect, weekly or monthly, on how your systems are working for you. 
Are your Beeminder graphs actually causing you to move towards the ultimate goal? 
Or do they need to be tweaked somehow?
</p>
<h2>
  Current Integration Features
</h2>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;Complice has built-in weekly reviews, which for me have often been a source of creating new Beeminder goals&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  And that&#8217;s just conceptually. 
Complice has also been taking extensive advantage of the Beeminder API to make it so that you can take some of the numbers that Complice spits out, graph them, and have some more hard accountability.
</p>
<p>
  So far, the integration includes
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>
      beemind using Complice at all:
    </strong>
    Complice works best if you check into it daily, so you can beemind this. This is the epitome of &#8220;hard accountability for soft accountability&#8221;.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      beemind how many tasks you intend or complete in Complice:
    </strong>
    I actually think that this one isn&#8217;t as good as the previous one because the amount of tasks will vary and what&#8217;s most important is to keep up the habit. But one neat thing is that for individual Complice goals, you can beemind &#8220;I need to do an average of 1 thing daily towards this goal&#8221;
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      beemind pomodoros:
    </strong>
    Complice has a built-in pomodoro timer, with the ability to assign completed pomodoros to individual tasks. You can then pipe these through to Beeminder to graph them and to make sure that you&#8217;re doing enough. This also has both total and per-goal options.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      beemind starred tasks:
    </strong>
    Want to have
    <a
      href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/mustdo/\\"
      title=\\"A Beeminder blog post about beeminding the most important thing.\\"
    >
      One Must-Do Task Each Day
    </a>
    ? You can track that in Complice+Beeminder. Star the task, and when you complete it, Beeminder will get a datapoint. Also works per-goal.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      beemind strategic reviews:
    </strong>
    Let&#8217;s face it, almost nobody does their weekly reviews. I&#8217;m the
    <em>
      creator
    </em>
    of Complice and I find it hard. But now that I have to pay if I don&#8217;t, well&#8230; I&#8217;m a lot more consistent about it. So you can beemind weekly and monthly reviews as well.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  All of these integrations have the ability to generate a new Beeminder goal from within Complice, making it really easy to get set up even if you&#8217;re not that familiar with Beeminder.
And hey, convenient even if you are.
</p>
<p>
  There are also more integrations coming, including having your Beeminder goal status (what&#8217;s about to derail) built into Complice as a kind of dashboard so that you can see what you&#8217;re going to need to pay attention to. 
Because unlike Beeminder, Complice is based around the idea that you&#8217;ll keep it open and check in regularly throughout the day.
So it&#8217;s a natural place to want to see and update your Beeminder goals from.
</p>
<h2>
  Social Productivity!
</h2>
<p>
  The last bit of announcement is that we&#8217;ve opened up a
  <a
    href=\\"https://complice.co/room/beeminder\\"
    title=\\"It&#39;s where the cool kids are\\"
  >
    Beeminder virtual coworking room
  </a>
  on Complice.
You know how it can be really helpful to get together with friends and all work on different projects?
How just the shared sense of we&#8217;re-working-here really helps to keep you on task?
Well, this is like that, but you don&#8217;t have to leave the comfort of your own desk!
Worried that it will be more socializing than working?
Nope, we&#8217;ve got pomodoros.
Here&#8217;s how it works:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Sign in to the room.
    <strong>
      You don&#8217;t have to be a registered Complice user to use it
    </strong>
    &#8212; guests are welcome!
  </li>
  <li>
    Optionally stream video to other members.
  </li>
  <li>
    Put in what you&#8217;re working on (you can see what others are working on too)
  </li>
  <li>
    When the pomodoro timer is red, work! When the pomo timer is green, chat with other people in the room
  </li>
  <li>
    You can talk about whatever or ask/offer help with things
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Again, the room is open to anyone, not just logged-in Complice users. 
There is at least one advantage to having a Complice account though &#8212; it lets you log your completed pomodoros, which automatically sync with Beeminder. 
Also in the works: an integration that will let you beemind &#8220;I need to show up in this room 5+ days a week&#8221;.

<p>
  Here&#8217;s a common (pointed) question about Beeminder:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Isn&#8217;t it better to use intrinsic, positive motivation?
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Our answer is that positive reinforcement is great but punishment can work amazingly too.
Loss aversion is powerful.
[UPDATE: Oops, turns out we didn&#8217;t technically mean
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/aversion\\"
    title=\\"Loss Aversion Aversion\\"
  >
    loss aversion
  </a>
  in that sentence, just punishment. 
Punishment is powerful.
The underlying points stand!]
</p>
<p>
  But, sure, ideally you should make Beeminder superfluous by establishing habits and cultivating discipline and setting up trigger-action plans, and peer support, etc etc. 
But the real power of Beeminder &#8212; besides the tracking and graphs and reminders and all that &#8212; is catching you in case you fail at making it superfluous.
It&#8217;s like an insurance policy.
</p>
<p>
  Here&#8217;s another common &#8212; and even more pointed but also more constructive &#8212; question about Beeminder:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Could Beeminder hold your money and give it back to you or use other tricks to reward you for success instead of punish you for failure?
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  This sounds good but we&#8217;re not into it.
I mean, first, we do have plenty of positive reinforcement in the form of pretty graphs and the satisfaction of adding datapoints.
You can even spin the pledges as positive &#8212; they help you quantify the value of your goals.
That can be powerful information for us rationality nerds.
</p>
<p>
  But why not reframe Beeminder to focus on rewards?
Well, paying money up front and getting it back unless you derail is a trick &#8212; it&#8217;s equivalent to getting stung.
At least for me personally, the equivalency would always be at the back of my mind and bother me.
</p>
<p>
  And there are more pragmatic problems.
I like having scary high pledges on some of my goals.
It would feel especially unreasonable to pay up front on those.
Even more pragmatically, most goals are open-ended: 
get 10k steps (or work 40 hours, or practice piano for half an hour or whatever) per day forever. 
There&#8217;s typically no particular point when it makes sense to get your money back.
It would be totally inefficient to have money always flowing back and forth and would really muddy the mental accounting in terms of how much you&#8217;re paying Beeminder for the motivation it&#8217;s giving you.
</p>
<p>
  Not to mention the laws and accounting involved. 
We&#8217;d be kind of a bank and have revenue that wouldn&#8217;t count as revenue. 
I assume this part would be perfectly overcomeable if we were convinced the psychology / behavioral economics were right.
But, again, we are not.
</p>
<p>
  In conclusion, we can&#8217;t afford to literally pay you to go to the gym or clear your inbox or write your thesis or whatever.
We&#8217;re a business.
So ultimately &#8212; for the monetary aspect at least &#8212; all we can offer are negative consequences.
&#8220;Do what you said you&#8217;d do or pay up.&#8221;
Trying to psychologically flip it around just adds fuzziness and inefficiency.
And you&#8217;re too smart to fall for it anyway.
Just embrace the punishment!

<p>
  You can probably just go do that and stop reading now.
</p>
<p>
  But here&#8217;s a refinement for the unlikely case that you actually reach the bottom of your pile and nothing new arrives.
First, dial the rate to +1 every 2 weeks.
So 0.5 per week or 1/14 per day.
Then, when your goal comes up for

    title=\\"Previous Beeminder blog post about reviewing your goals every week, especially to schedule breaks for things coming up on your calendar\\"
  >
    review each week
  </a>
  , you&#8217;ll notice that it has a beemergency coming up the week after next.
(It will necessarily be at least a week in the future if you&#8217;re reviewing the goal weekly.)
You can&#8217;t dispatch that beemergency because there&#8217;s nothing in the backlog, so you add a two-week flat spot to the goal.
</p>
<p>
  Then just keep repeating that every week.
As long as nothing new arrives in the backlog, you&#8217;ll keep flattening the goal&#8217;s bright red line for another two weeks.
If new things show up rarely enough you could even make months-long flat spots instead of two weeks, to minimize the fussery.
But the idea is that you could never forget about it indefinitely.
You&#8217;ve

  it.
</p>
<p>
  It&#8217;s kind of embarrassing how much over-engineering I did trying to solve the problem of backlogs before settling on this.
The control systems approach with manual Do More goals has been working for me for a lot of different kinds of goals.
</p>
<h2>
  Examples
</h2>
<h3>
  Zombies
</h3>
<p>
  A zombie is our term for a regression.
A thing that used to work but broke.
Aka backward progress.
These are bad. 
Shamefully, we had let dozens of them accumulate over the years until we got serious about beeminding our way through them,

    href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/meta/zombies\\"
    title=\\"Original zombies goal\\"
  >
    using a whittle-down goal
  </a>
  .
Right around new years we managed to hit

    title=\\"Nitty-gritty forum discussion about it from when we had 8 zombies left\\"
  >
    Zombie Zero
  </a>
  .
Then we backslid slightly and are now
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/meta/zombiequeen\\"
    title=\\"New zombies goal\\"
  >
    beeminding it control-systems-style
  </a>
  .
We seem to generate one per week on average, so that&#8217;s what our bright red line is dialed to, to keep us to at most a handful of zombies outstanding (outshambling).
</p>
<h3>
  Paper
</h3>
<p>
  Through some kind of catastrophic adulting failure in the early years of Beeminder, Bee and I ended up with a refrigerator-sized box of unsorted notes, documents, artwork from our kids, and mail.
We spent literally years beeminding that down to a nice little stack.
Which we now keep as a nice little stack by beeminding it control-systems-style.
</p>
<h3>
  Clutter
</h3>
<p>
  Cleaning and decluttering can be overwhelming because there&#8217;s so much junk that&#8217;s so hard to decide what to do with (hashtag first world problems).
At some point Bee and I and our kids went around dumping all the clutter around the house into a box and then all made clutterbox goals:
plain manual Do More goals to remove a couple items a day and decide where they belong (often the garbage).
</p>
<p>
  Once again, if the box is getting fuller, we dial our roads up; if the box is nearing empty, we dial them down.
</p>
<p>
  This one fizzled a bit as the box ended up mostly empty and people flattened their Beeminder goals but the house remained a mess.
Our new plan is that you get a +1 for putting things
  <em>
    in
  </em>
  the box as well, but we don&#8217;t know how that&#8217;s going to play out yet.
</p>
<h3>
  Pocket queues
</h3>
<p>
  To repeat myself from the

  </a>
  , make your bright red line a bit steeper if you’re saving articles faster than you’re reading them and make it a bit shallower if you actually find yourself close to emptying your Pocket queue altogether.
Easy-peasy.
</p>
<p>
  (And it&#8217;s about a million times better than what I used to do with Pocket, trying to

    href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/d/pocket\\"
    title=\\"Behold that monstrosity\\"
  >
    beemind the sum of the ages
  </a>
  , in days, of all the articles in my queue.
I thought I needed a clever metric that incentivized focusing on things that were more stale.
I did not need that.

    title=\\"Beeminder blog post about the Anti-Magic Principle\\"
  >
    less magical
  </a>
  . 
There&#8217;s no confusion or ambiguity about what I have to do to dispatch a beemergency, it&#8217;s perfectly predictable when beemergencies happen, and it&#8217;s easy enough to adjust the rate as I go to achieve the underlying goal. 
Namely, having my backlog of articles gradually shrink or at least not gradually grow without bound &#8212;

    title=\\"Redqueening, Inbox Zero, Backlogs, and Fluid Dynamics\\"

  </a>
  , 
in other words.)
</p>
<h3>
  Browser tabs, Trello cards, you name it
</h3>
<p>
  This technique applies to a lot of things!
Email is another obvious one, but that&#8217;s tricky in practice because messages flow both in and out at a dizzying rate.
I believe the control systems approach would work great but would require automatically telling Beeminder how many messages you&#8217;re archiving or deleting.
In the meantime, I&#8217;ve stuck with a

  We (Danny and Bee, that is) are on the right (as in &#8220;dexter&#8221;, not necessarily &#8220;correct&#8221;) side of the Atlantic Ocean for a bit. 
Come meet up with us and discuss Beemindery things, like group goals, commitment devices, auctions, and algorithms for participatory democracy?

<h2>
  What brings you all this way?
</h2>
<p>
  Well, we have been in Germany this week, where Danny is giving a talk at a seminar on Algorithms for Participatory Democracy. 
What does that have to do with Beeminder? 
The main excuse for the talk is showing off Danny&#8217;s old work on group decision mechanisms (and especially how we still use it every day in our family). 
But there&#8217;s significant Beeminder tie-in as well because we&#8217;re also working up a beta feature for group goals this week. 
Group commitment devices is sufficiently on topic for the nerds here at Dagstuhl.
</p>
<h2>
  Did you say group goals?
</h2>
<p>
  That&#8217;s right. The feature is in private beta (reply to the latest monthly beemail to get in on it) but the idea is that you still have a single graph but it shows up in multiple people&#8217;s dashboards/galleries, multiple people can add data to it, and if it derails, everyone is charged. 
(Or perhaps we&#8217;ll generalize it so you can choose how to divvy the charge? 
That would also give us the use case of &#8220;following&#8221; a friend&#8217;s graph, where it&#8217;d show up in your gallery but you wouldn&#8217;t be taking on any risk yourself.)
</p>
<p>
  We&#8217;ve wanted this ourselves for a long time for family chores and joint papers and other projects. 
Have you ever wanted a group goal?
If you have a use case in mind, come tell us about it!

  I&#8217;ve been railing against automated copyright dates for years but just learned Serine Molecule scooped me in
  <a href=\\"https://serinemolecule.tumblr.com/post/168702330133/copyright-notices-are-not-clocks\\">
    Copyright Notices Are Not Clocks
  </a>
  :
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    You should update the copyright year whenever you make
    <em>
      nontrivial, copyrightable changes
    </em>
    to your work. 
Not every year, and definitely not automatically.
If you do it automatically, you are lying to your users, and lying is unprofessional, and I would not recommend it.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Or maybe technically we scooped them, but you had to view our html source or read
  <a
    href=\\"https://forum.beeminder.com/t/found-a-little-easter-egg/5128/\\"
    title=\\"From the time in 2019 when Beeminder user matti discovered the easter egg in our html source\\"
  >
    an anfractuous forum thread
  </a>
  to find it.
Also I didn&#8217;t actually intend for it to be a very serious argument at the time and only gradually took my own argument seriously and started thinking of automated copyright years as literally dishonest.
</p>
<p>
  The way it first came up is users would start telling us in January or February that our copyright date still said the previous year, like they were telling us about a glob of spinach on our teeth.
Sometimes they would helpfully offer to show us how to display the current year dynamically.
We debated it and my argument was this:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    i can&#8217;t tell what fraction serious i am about doing it manually. 
i guess if, counterfactually, we ever weren&#8217;t at the wheel it would be lies and that feels icky.
like there&#8217;s something inherently dishonest about literally being like &#8220;copyright&#8230; uh, whatever year it is when you&#8217;re reading this!&#8221;
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Which is exactly Serine Molecule&#8217;s point and it now seems almost obvious so I&#8217;m a little embarrassed that I only took myself half seriously at the time (though seriously enough to never assent to automating it at least!).
</p>
<p>
  We also joked about what the cynical, slytherinly optimal way to handle copyright dates was and how setting it to the current year was actually a dead giveaway that you&#8217;d automated it. 
Instead you could do
  <code>
    year(now-random(5,10)*86400)
  </code>
  &#8212; simulating a fairly attentive human at the wheel updating the copyright 5-10 days after new year&#8217;s.

is, as of this writing, 12 days after new year&#8217;s, still saying copyright 2022.
So we&#8217;re hopeful that automating the copyright year has finally become uncool.

        <br>
        I think Danny had some convoluted reasoning for why we shouldn&#8217;t just make that programmatic, like &#8220;it&#8217;s a signal that the site is still active&#8221;, but I think that&#8217;s kind of incorrect &#8212; anyone writing a website can make the copyright date be programmatically generated, so it doesn&#8217;t actually serve as any indicator of currency, it can only serve as a anti-activity signal by going out of date.

    UVIs
  </a>
  which are a bright signal that we&#8217;re actively making changes and improvements.
And in practice we deploy new code several to many, many times in a typical week.
So what we decided, as of today, is to automate getting the date-of-last-deploy in our site footer.
Now the use-by date on your carton of Beeminder is exquisitely up to date. 
No sour milk surprises for you.
It looks like this:

  The version in the actual Ruby source, which I&#8217;ve reproduced here, makes slightly more sense than what you see in the html source since the html source macro-expands the macros being talked about! 
Fun philosophical case study for the use-mention distinction perhaps.

to help us with a big redesign.

things about Beeminder is very much not furthering that objective.
But conveying them to you, readers of our excessively nerdy blog, is a good first step.
</p>
<p>
  So today let&#8217;s see if we can convey the Things You Must Know before you give Beeminder your credit card, as well as all the reasons why it&#8217;s not nearly as scary as it sounds (even though it&#8217;s legitimately a little scary because that&#8217;s the point).
</p>
<p>
  Beeminder can&#8217;t be a credible threat unless it has a way to automatically

    take your money
  </a>
  .
That&#8217;s the whole point.
So we twist your arm pretty hard to add a credit card.
Sure, you can create at least one goal and blissfully beemind indefinitely without ever adding one, but as soon as you first go off track, or even try to create additional goals, we insist that you make that sword of Damocles real.

  had a highly disruptive event in my life. 
Overnight my priorities rapidly changed, and not all of my Beeminder goals made sense anymore. 
This is the story of how I dealt with my commitments during a period of stress.
</p>
<h2>
  The day after
</h2>
<p>
  When real life changes suddenly, you deal with it.
Your beemergency days are no longer relevant.
When the first derailment happened, I
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/sos/\\"
    title=\\"Blog post about Beeminder&#39;s SOS clause, but you don&#39;t need to know any of that -- just reply to the legit check and say what happened in case of extenuating circumstances. We&#39;ll help sort it out.\\"
  >
    replied to the legitimacy check email
  </a>
  explaining what was going on in my life and that not only was that particular derailment not due to avoidance, but that I had 3 other goals that would derail the next day for the same reason.
</p>
<p>
  The Beeminder support crew cancelled the pending charge, and injected a short flat spot in the 3 other goals. 
This made my life much easier, because I didn&#8217;t even have to deal with any legitimacy check emails the following day.
</p>
<h2>
  The day after the day after
</h2>
<p>
  Even though the incident in my life was going to span several weeks, by now I had enough of a plan for how to deal with it that I could start to think about triaging my Beeminder goals.
</p>
<p>
  Some goals were still relevant in my changing world, so I left those untouched. 
That includes all of the sanity-maintaining goals like getting some exercise and eating properly. 
(Though I relaxed the slope on some, because although I wanted to keep doing some exercise, I didn&#8217;t need to push myself.)
</p>
<p>
  Other goals would be relevant again one day, but not right now. 
For these I used the
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/breaks/\\"
    title=\\"“Yeah, dude, I&#39;m totally not going to make it in next week”\\"
  >
    take-a-break
  </a>
  feature to temporarily flatten the road for the expected duration of the disruption. 
(If the disruption turns out to be shorter than you expect,
  <em>
    &#8220;take-a-break&#8221;
  </em>
  can be used to restore your slope too!)
</p>
<p>
  For now-irrelevant goals, I set the end date to as soon as possible, i.e., one week out.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;In times of stress, having a routine is a stabilising factor&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  For autodata goals, I mostly set a highly conservative (shallow) slope and left them running. 
The conservative (shallow) slope means that they&#8217;re unlikely to be difficult to keep up, and not cancelling them means that I won&#8217;t have the hassle of setting up the automation again.
</p>
<p>
  Any non-current goal I put on the
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/glossary#b\\"
    title=\\"To backburner a goal just means to shove it to the bottom of your goal gallery -- not to be confused with archiving\\"
  >
    back-burner
  </a>
  by pressing the minus sign that appears when you hover over the graph in the goal gallery. 
These were the goals that I was willing to have derail.
</p>
<h2>
  Reducing the fallout
</h2>
<p>
  Now I was in a position where some goals were scheduled to end, others made conservative, and reasonably prioritised between front-burner and back-burner.
</p>
<p>
  Most of my goals are set to
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/glossary/#nomercy\\"
    title=\\"Normally you automatically rerail with a one-week flat spot. Check the no-mercy checkbox in your goal settings if you want to be immediately back on the hook with no safety buffer if you derail.\\"
  >
    no-mercy recommits
  </a>
  , 
because for myself I find that flat weeks make it more difficult to recover momentum.
So I went through the settings of every non-urgent goal and put that back to an ordinary reset.
If it happens to derail, I want that week.
</p>
<p>
  Similarly, if anything derails on me right now, it&#8217;s probably because of deliberate prioritisation, not procrastination. 
So I also set most goals
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/pledgecaps/\\"
    title=\\"This was written when we had a more primitive way to prevent pledges from increasing. Now we give you full control with pledge caps.\\"
  >
    not to increase the pledge
  </a>
  if they happen to derail.
</p>
<p>
  I also looked at the goals that I&#8217;d pushed to the back-burner and noted down the high-pledge ones. 
These ones I really didn&#8217;t want to derail because of life prioritisation. 
So I sent a followup email to support asking for an immediate flat spot so that my more conservative road could kick in, rather than a derailment. 
In my case, there was only one goal that fit the criteria, out of the 29 on the back-burner.
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"OMG1\\"
    href=\\"#OMG\\"
  >
    [2]
  </a>
  So I knew that I wasn&#8217;t creating a support burden.
</p>
<h2>
  Goals in the real world
</h2>
<p>
  Not everything is in Beeminder.
Not everything should be in Beeminder.
Like me, you&#8217;ve almost certaintly got task lists
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"GTD1\\"
    href=\\"#GTD\\"
  >
    [3]
  </a>
  and projects on the go.
All of those go on the back-burner too &#8212; start a new list.
The new list will consist of the projects and tasks that are newly top-of-mind.
Don&#8217;t forget to include the task of reviewing that backlog for actions that are still important in your new world.
</p>
<h2>
  Aftermath
</h2>
<p>
  At the end of this triage, all of my goals were in an almost ideal state, where the dollar value pledged was acceptable given the risk of derailment and the importance of the goal. 
Derailment on the back-burner goals became a rational and neutral decision because I&#8217;d effectively already sacrificed those goals in my head; any that stayed on the road were a bonus.
</p>
<p>
  In the end, I had a few minor derailments, but mostly this worked as planned. 
As much as anything can work as planned when the world has thrown a wrench in your plans. 
But you know what I mean.
</p>
<p>
  This was made easier because although I have a large number of goals, I manage the slopes fairly conservatively. 
I rely on my
  <a
    href=\\"https://beeminder.com/premium\\"
    title=\\"Old blog post -- though we keep it updated -- that introduces the premium plans\\"
  >
    Plan Bee subscription
  </a>
  to automatically ratchet the road so that even the goals with shallow minimum-desired-progress roads don&#8217;t build up too much safety buffer. 
I carefully choose which goals to be aggressive with, which is another way of saying that some of my goals are just intentions and others are proper things to achieve or do. 
There&#8217;s a difference, and Beeminder works well for both, if you set the parameters right.
</p>
<p>
  One thing that I worried about was whether I&#8217;d remember to undo the ultra-conservative settings.
It turns out that it&#8217;s easier to manage goals that are on the front-burner.
Every time I get the urge to move a goal off of the back-burner, that&#8217;s my cue to review its slope and settings.
I had thought that I might need to make a note in my calendar to make doing that a
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/mustdo\\"
    title=\\"The One Must-Do Task Each Day\\"
  >
    mustdo
  </a>
  task for sometime next week/month/whenever.
Happily it has turned out to be a more natural process than I&#8217;d feared.
</p>
<h2>
  Maslovian beeminding
</h2>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;Deciding priorities myself sometimes demanded more self-awareness than I was able to muster&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  One thing that surprised me is how difficult it became to concentrate on anything substantial.
Events that were expected still knocked me sideways, and there were emotional rollercoasters to ride.
A friend reminded me about 
Maslow&#8217;s hierarchy
and the theory of human motivation.
No wonder I was having trouble focusing on more abstract goals; my foundational levels had been destabilised.
</p>
<p>
  One thing that Beeminder is great at is reminding me to do routine items, things that aren&#8217;t difficult, but which would otherwise get neglected.
In times of stress, having a routine is a stabilising factor.
In retrospect, I could have done more of this, not putting quite so much on the back burner, and letting Beeminder dictate when each thing needed some attention.
Because deciding priorities myself sometimes demanded more self-awareness than I was able to muster.
The additional structure of having more active goals might have been welcome.
</p>
<p>
  I&#8217;m really pleased how Beeminder continued to support me and my goals during this time, and how the support team responded. 
I know that I&#8217;m biased, but it made me feel as though we can help our users cope with pretty much anything.

  Yes, I&#8217;ve got a lot of goals.
I&#8217;ve been using Beeminder for over 2 years [UPDATE: over 3 years by the time we published this; NEW UPDATE: 7 years and going strong!], and my ability to keep up with more goals has increased over time.
A lot of that has come from figuring out what goals suit me, and how aggressive a slope to set.
The actual number waxes and wanes based on real life deadlines, and several of the current set are related to

<p>
  Beeminder creates a series of intermediate daily deadlines, working towards some desired long-term goal.
As you probably know, it does that with real-money commitment devices.
It&#8217;s common to come down to the wire on those deadlines every dang day.
It&#8217;s powerful motivation.
But is it&#8230; too powerful?
</p>
<p>
  If you&#8217;re a strong believer in the concept of self-discipline then Beeminder may seem like a crutch for the lazy.
We have a lot of objections to the premises of that argument but let&#8217;s take it for granted for now that self-discipline is necessary and important and constructing elaborate external incentives is cheating, bad, wrong, and counter-productive.
Our first claim is that even if all that were true, Beeminder can still be used productively.
</p>
<h3>
  Trapezes and Safety Ropes
</h3>
<p>
  A tortured analogy might involve trapeze rigging.
You could use ropes to help support you as you fly through the air with the greatest of ease.
Let&#8217;s say that makes you weaker and hurts you in the long run.
Our answer: use the ropes to make a safety net.
They&#8217;re not touching you, but if you slip up, they&#8217;ll be there.
</p>
<p>
  In Beeminderland, that means using the Beeminder graph to track your progress but dialing the commitment down to something stupidly easy.
Something it would be a travesty to fall short of.
Then exercise your self-discipline in staying far above Beeminder&#8217;s bright red line. 
If you succeed, wonderful. 
If not, Beeminder will enforce that bare minimum. 
After all, if your self-discipline does fail, better to use the crutch and still get some productivity than fall completely on one&#8217;s face. 
You can keep using other &#8212; what those who self-identify as self-disciplined might consider more wholesome &#8212; productivity methods until you find something that makes Beeminder superfluous. 
Also we don&#8217;t think Beeminder is superfluous even if you&#8217;re not leaning on it for motivation.
The data and graphs are a valuable measure and visualization of your progress!
</p>
<p>
  But now let us get back to arguing against the premises of the claim that Beeminder is a crutch for the undisciplined.
We have a blog post on the
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/typebee/\\"
    title=\\"The traits are (1) akratic, (2) ambitious/motivated (ironically), (3) self-aware, (4) high-integrity, (5) data nerdery\\"
  >
    Type Bee personality
  </a>
  arguing, a bit self-congratulatorily, what brilliant, disciplined, high-integrity people Beeminder users are.
It also analogizes Beeminder to wearing glasses.
It&#8217;s great if you don&#8217;t need them but if you do need them, just wear the dang things rather than stumble around bumping into furniture wishing you didn&#8217;t.
</p>
<h3>
  Willpower
</h3>
<p>
  Circumstantial evidence, you say?
Beeminder users may be hyperproductive superstars but that doesn&#8217;t mean Beeminder is making them that way.
As for analogizing Beeminder to wearing glasses, what if Beeminder is more like training wheels on a bike, you ask?
What if Beeminder
  <em>
    atrophies
  </em>
  your willpower?
</p>
<p>
  Oh boy. 
First, there&#8217;s a misconception to clear up:
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/ego\\"
    title=\\"Ego Depletion Depletion\\"
  >
    willpower is not like a muscle
  </a>
  . 
If you don&#8217;t believe us and really want to exercise your willpower, there are any number of ways you can do that.
Keep a jar of jellybeans on your desk maybe?
Just pick something that doesn&#8217;t jeopardize your life goals if your willpower exercising goes awry sometimes.
</p>
<p>
  More to the point, setting up a Beeminder goal is a pretty elaborate act of self-discipline. 
That&#8217;s kind of a self-burn but is still pretty true no matter how intuitive and frictionless creating Beeminder goals may become.
Just formulating a graphable goal and making the choice to commit to it is a big deal.
And to whatever extent it does free up willpower, that would just let you redeploy it elsewhere. 
But, again, we don&#8217;t think
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/willpower\\"
    title=\\"Follow up to the &#39;Ego Depletion Depletion&#39; post and what willpower actually is\\"
  >
    willpower works like that
  </a>
  .
</p>
<p>
  Maybe the strongest argument against outsourcing your willpower to Beeminder is that if you&#8217;re truly incorrigible then you&#8217;ll waste a bunch of money for no benefit. 
We make a big deal out of the
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/wantcanwill\\"

  >
    Want-Can-Will Test
  </a>
  to try to avoid that outcome:
don&#8217;t beemind something unless it&#8217;s something you
  <em>
    want
  </em>
  to do and
  <em>
    can

To further ensure you won&#8217;t be so incorrigible, you need to find your Motivation Point:

  that helps you find your Motivation Point without having to agonize over it.
But if you predict that you would just lose money without making progress on your goals then we don&#8217;t really have a counterargument to that.
You probably shouldn&#8217;t use Beeminder.

<h3>
  Can one fix their self-control problems at a deeper level and not need Beeminder?
</h3>
<p>
  Even if you can, we don&#8217;t see it as an argument against commitment devices and other incentive-alignment tricks.
Unless you&#8217;re somehow
  <em>
    certain
  </em>
  that you&#8217;ve permanently and fundamentally solved your akrasia, it&#8217;s too soon to discard Beeminder and related techniques.
Maybe you can use

  or self-affirmations or raw introspective magic and then effortlessly maintain plenty of safety buffer on your Beeminder goals. 
That would be amazing and we don&#8217;t want to be dismissive about the possibility.
Just, you know, maybe start with the Beeminder graph and use it as proof that that magic happened?

<h3>
  What about studies suggesting that monetary rewards decrease intrinsic motivation?
</h3>
<p>
  We&#8217;ve got three counterpoints to this one.
</p>
<p>
  Point 1: 
Beeminder doesn&#8217;t offer monetary rewards, only
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/contrapositive/\\"
    title=\\"Contra Positive Reinforcement: Why Beeminder Is A Glutton For Punishment\\"
  >
    punishments
  </a>
  .
</p>
<p>
  Maybe that&#8217;s not too persuasive of a counterpoint. 
(Point 0 would be to question whether those studies
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/milkman/\\"
    title=\\"UPDATE: Adding this link to a more recent Beeminder blog post. See the final section, “But Will It Replicate?”\\"
  >
    even replicate
  </a>
  , which is even less persuasive because we have no idea if they do.)
The next ones are better.
</p>
<p>
  Point 2: 
Doing something because Beeminder is making you isn&#8217;t all that extrinsic anyway.
Beeminder is just a proxy for your own past self.
Did we mention the
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/wantcanwill\\"
    title=\\"In particular, before beeminding something be certain that you both *want* to do it and *can* do it. If so then you can be confident that with Beeminder you *will* do it.\\"
  >
    Want-Can-Will Test
  </a>
  ? 
If, after balancing all the pros and cons, you don&#8217;t genuinely, unambiguously want to do something, don&#8217;t beemind it!
</p>
<p>
  Point 3:
This is the trapeze safety ropes again.
Think of Beeminder as insurance and try to make it irrelevant and superfluous.
Find that intrinsic motivation, cultivate habits, get your System 1 and System 2 in alignment, set up Trigger-Action Plans.
Whatever you think is better than Beeminder, do those things!
Beeminder can just be there to catch you if they fail.
</p>
<p>
  Personally we find that Beeminder goals reinforce our intrinsic motivation, but that might just be us.
We hope we&#8217;re at least convincing you that Beeminder isn&#8217;t inherently harmful to intrinsic motivation.
</p>
<h3>
  Crutch Crux
</h3>
<p>
  We believe there&#8217;s only one argument remaining for how Beeminder may count as a crutch, in the sense of helping you in a way that keeps you weak.
We&#8217;ve actually heard this more than once in the rationality community.
It&#8217;s that you shouldn&#8217;t use Beeminder because
  <em>
    not
  </em>
  using Beeminder will force you to solve your self-control problems at a deeper level.
Fortunately this argument is beautifully self-defeating, taking the value of commitment devices as a premise.
</p>
<p>
  It brings us back to the trapeze analogy.
If you can learn to fly, so to speak, without safety ropes, our hats are off to you.
If you refuse safety ropes because you

<p>
  We&#8217;re often praised for our stellar customer support.
For the possible benefit of other startups, or anyone else who&#8217;s curious, here are our secrets!
</p>
<p>
  First, all the usual &#8220;customer is always right&#8221; stuff is just common sense if you&#8217;re genuinely excited about promoting your company and having your users feel good about you.
I&#8217;m skipping everything that was obvious to me from the start.
But there are a few things that maybe seem obvious in retrospect that I didn&#8217;t appreciate until doing a ton of support myself.
</p>
<h3>
  Be (really) informal
</h3>
<p>
  Never ever say anything corporate-like about &#8220;apologizing for the inconvenience&#8221; or &#8220;being of further assistance&#8221;. 
In fact, if you read what you&#8217;ve written to a user out loud and it&#8217;s possible to tell that it&#8217;s not being spoken to your best friend, rewrite it.
No exaggeration &#8212; I treat that as a hard rule.
It also helps get replies out quicker, once you&#8217;re used to it.
</p>
<p>
  UPDATE 2016:
This is all standing the test of time beautifully but one thing we&#8217;ve noticed is that just because something sounds sweet and friendly in your head doesn&#8217;t mean there aren&#8217;t
  <a

    title=\\"Key &amp; Peele video: Text Message Confusion\\"

  </a>
  .
Classic example of the
  <a
    href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusion_of_transparency\\"
    title=\\"The illusion of transparency is a tendency for people to overestimate the degree to which their personal mental state is known by others. Another manifestation of the illusion of transparency (sometimes called the observer's illusion of transparency) is a tendency for people to overestimate how well they understand others' personal mental states. This cognitive bias is similar to theillusion of asymmetric insight.\\"
  >
    illusion of transparency
  </a>
  .
So err on the side of effusive friendliness.
</p>
<h3>
  Be grateful (even to jerks)
</h3>
<p>
  The best-friend heuristic has another benefit: 
If a user is ever frustrated or annoyed or hostile, put on rose-colored glasses and willfully reinterpret their tone as helpful and constructive &#8212; something your friend would say because they genuinely want to help you improve &#8212; and respond with the appropriate tone of gratitude.

<p>
  Today in a Hacker News thread about procrastination where I gave a Beeminder spiel, someone replied with this: &#8220;So the time not wasted on facebook goes wasted in your pseudo solution?&#8221;
My reply was:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Ooh, no, I think beeminding is pretty low overhead! Especially if you connect it with RescueTime or another automatic data source. Maybe still too much learning curve up front but once you have it set up and dialed in it&#8217;s nearly frictionless.
    <br>
     
    <br>
    I&#8217;m also anxious to learn what makes it give the impression of being a pseudo solution. We think of commitment devices as the nuclear option in the war on akrasia.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;It&#8217;s very unlikely that that person is actually a jerk.&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  If it had been a support email I&#8217;d have added something like &#8220;thanks so much for the feedback on this!&#8221;
Note the willful oblivion to how much of a jerk the person was being.
And in reality it&#8217;s very unlikely that that person is actually a jerk.
They probably genuinely had the impression that Beeminder is nothing but a cynical, gimmicky attempt to capitalize on people&#8217;s akrasia.
Which is valuable for us to learn!
(Yes, I know that everyone reading this blog fully understands how we&#8217;re the opposite of that, but we have to care about first impressions.)
</p>
<h3 id=\\"upsidedown\\">
  Don&#8217;t just offer help, ask for it
</h3>
<p>
  A lot of phrases like &#8220;we appreciate your feedback&#8221; sound downright insincere, having been ruined by big slimy corporations.
It&#8217;s reasonably obvious to steer clear of things like that, especially given our first rule &#8212; be informal.
But I spotted this in an old email from one of us:
&#8220;Let me know if there&#8217;s anything else that I can help you with!&#8221;
Perfectly informal and sounds so friendly and helpful.
But I&#8217;ve come to believe that it backfires.
</p>
<p>
  Here&#8217;s my latest thinking on why.
First, people are thoroughly cynical about companies wanting to &#8220;help&#8221; them.
Second, psychology! People want to help people. They go out of their way to do so. 
People are nice, even altruistic. 
They don&#8217;t want to take up our time asking questions.
</p>
<p>
  When we were just getting started and willing to do pretty much anything for our initial users, Melanie, our resident fitness expert, would offer advice and coaching and people would think to themselves &#8220;well, that&#8217;s not fair, I&#8217;m not paying for that&#8221;. 
If you emphasize how much their feedback is helping you, users respond better.
Generally the point of customer support is helping users, but we now make it a point to emphasize how they&#8217;re helping us, too.
For example, to the seeming jerk in the example above I&#8217;d maybe add, quite sincerely, &#8220;it&#8217;s hugely valuable for us to learn about things that are off-putting or confusing at first so please keep the feedback coming!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
  You can bend over backwards offering help and it makes users feel guilty or suspicious and ignore you. 
If you ask
  <em>
    them
  </em>
  for help &#8212; or make clear that asking you questions is not a burden but a vital form of feedback that you need for improving the product &#8212; then they respond effusively, and bend over backwards to help you.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;Make clear that asking you questions is not a burden but a vital form of feedback.&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  In any case, at this point it&#8217;s an empirical fact.
People respond better to helping us than us helping them.
To be clear, this is no gimmick.
Users only need our help in the first place because our website sucks. 
We&#8217;re not helping them, we&#8217;re just making up for the sucking (and learning how to unsuckify it). 
So no matter how much you help someone don&#8217;t talk about it that way. 
Turn it around and explicitly thank them for helping you suck less.
</p>
<h3>
  Reply immediately
</h3>
<p>
  It&#8217;s just ridiculous how well users react to immediate responses. 
People have written
  <a href=\\"https://plus.google.com/118275811754025086770/posts/PgiuEASDS2P\\">
    whole blog posts
  </a>
  about how amazing we are just because of quick responses. 
Seriously, it&#8217;s impossible to overestimate how much this matters. 
I continue to fail at this because email sucks so hard, but holy crap does it matter.
I guess the psychology is that it&#8217;s frustrating to be ignored and you half expect to be, so every hour that goes by is confirming that expectation, and the growing frustrated feeling can&#8217;t be undone by the eventual reply, no matter how good it is. 
Or forget the psychoanalysis and trust the results: immediate responses are a goodwill goldmine.
</p>
<h3>
  Avoid going down rabbit holes
</h3>
<p>
  If you need more info from a user, keep to one dirt-simple question so they don&#8217;t put off reading/responding and can just fire back an answer.
This also helps with the immediacy of responses, which, in case I didn&#8217;t emphasize it enough, makes users want to have your babies.
</p>
<p>
  Also, don&#8217;t waste much time with users who are not in your target audience.
In our case, maybe they&#8217;re not nerdy enough to appreciate the graphs, or it becomes clear that there&#8217;s no way they&#8217;ll ever put in a credit card.
Don&#8217;t let those people take time away from your bread and butter (in our case, profligate nerds).
We&#8217;re quick to point people at

<h3>
  What not to do, and what to do instead
</h3>
<p>
  Here&#8217;s a response from one of us, early on, to a support request from someone who couldn&#8217;t figure out how to set up a goal in Beeminder:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    What was the objective of your goal?
What exactly were you trying to measure?
If you let me know these things perhaps I can help you set up an appropriate goal that will be suitable for what you want to track.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  It&#8217;s not obviously bad, of course, but it violates most of the above rules.
It&#8217;s slightly too formal (&#8220;appropriate goal that will be suitable&#8221;), 
it asks more than one question (rabbit hole danger, and hampers immediate replies), 
it offers to help without asking for help (or emphasizing that this is helping us), and 
it doesn&#8217;t show gratitude for the feedback.
Here&#8217;s how we&#8217;d probably rewrite it now, some ten thousand support replies later:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Ah, let us help! We&#8217;re working on making this all clearer so this helps us as well, in figuring out what&#8217;s currently confusing (so thank you!).
First question: What is this goal actually measuring?
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>
  PS: Beemind it, obviously
</h3>
<p>
  This almost goes without saying, but if you have trouble staying on top of support, or especially if you tend to avoid it because it can be a slog, you should beemind
  <strike>

I mean, they usually are friends of ours, but they&#8217;ve generally been Beeminder fans who then became friends.

The point was, we wanted to emphasize that we had actual strangers signing up for our craziness and it wasn&#8217;t all just friends and relatives whose arms we twisted.

As in: yes, sure, there are these lifehacking Quantified Self nerds or productivity fetishists who use Beeminder but if you pull a random person off the street there&#8217;s no way they&#8217;d touch this with a ten-foot pole, right?

  Hello, I&#8217;m Neil, and I have a secret motive for writing this guest post at Beeminder.
</p>
<p>
  You see, I&#8217;m beeminding the number of words I write, and I&#8217;m generously allowing this post to count towards my goal. 
That means that this completely content-free sentence is actually providing me with some benefit&#8230; 
although, admittedly, only in the most superficial and empty way possible.
</p>
<p>
  When it comes to rules I set for myself, sometimes I am harsh, and sometimes I am kind. 
(And sometimes I am sneakily weaselling while pretending to be virtuous, which in this case is fooling nobody.)
</p>
<p>
  Ninety-eight words already. Great.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;I chose to compare anxiety to the physics of non-Newtonian fluids&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  Like I said, I can be harsh to myself. 
So harsh, in fact, that for years I lived with terrible anxiety. 
For most of that time, I wasn&#8217;t even aware that there was an alternative. 
I thought
  <em>
    everyone
  </em>
  lived with a constant sense of impending doom, and they were just better at handling it.
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    (Beeminder improvement idea: find a way to automatically measure &#8216;sense of impending doom&#8217; and add it to a &#8220;Do Less&#8221; goal?)
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  But there came a breaking point, and I went deep down the rabbit hole of self-knowledge and self-improvement. 
I found that there were ways to hack my mind and think differently, and that relatively simple mental changes could help me to manage or reduce the anxiety.
</p>
<p>
  These days, I&#8217;m hardly anxious at all. 
(This can be a problem: the impending threat of Beeminder derailment still needs to motivate me into action!)
</p>
<p>
  Recently I was invited to give a TED talk about anxiety, and I chose to compare anxiety to the physics of non-Newtonian fluids &#8212; in particular, popular pudding sauce, custard.
</p>
<p>
  If you like humour, physics and mild mind-hacking then this might be something you&#8217;d enjoy:

<p>
  Building a better relationship with our own brains is tricky. 
In fact, I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s why many of us are drawn to this website in the first place.
</p>
<p>
  Perhaps this imagery of escaping from custard might be useful to you in your own battles against anxiety&#8230; or akrasia&#8230; or whatever else you struggle with.
</p>

  Meanwhile, I have 420+ words to add to my Beeminder goal, so my work here is done. 
I hope it has been helpful, entertaining &#8212; or ideally, both.

I personally am pretty allergic to &#8220;SAVE NOW!!&#8221;-style sales and coupons and whatnot.

</p>
<p>
  Ok, but for more reasonable consumers without my hang-ups, the whole Cyber Monday concept does make perfect sense.
I have a fancy degree in a field sort of related to economics so let me explain!
Limited-time promotions make money.
Ok, duh, but why does every business on the internet feel compelled to jump on the Cyber Monday bandwagon in particular?
Well, limited-time promotions work better if you have an excuse for them.
Otherwise you lose credibility that they&#8217;re really limited.
Consumers are savvy enough to know that you may be faking the urgency to get them off their butts and taking action (giving you money).
If the promotion is tied to a rare (e.g., annual) real-world event then it&#8217;s more believable that it&#8217;s going to actually end shortly and you&#8217;ll have to wait a year before it happens again.
</p>
<p>
  Add to that the fact that your users are primed for SAVING MONEY TODAY.
As long as they&#8217;re not like me, which most aren&#8217;t, they&#8217;re at least no less receptive than usual.
So you, as the business owner, might as well jump on the bandwagon since it&#8217;s probably high time you did another promotion anyway.
Because, as I mentioned, promotions make money.

I&#8217;m so excited about how much money we&#8217;re saving you that I&#8217;m going to hyperventilate.
Not only do you get N months free when you prepay for N months of a premium plan, but the more you buy, the cheaper it gets!
I.e., our exquisitely fair discount slider wouldn&#8217;t be fair if we removed the discounting just because it&#8217;s a cyber week, so you still get that too.

<p>
  Huge thanks to Beeminder for sharing this guest blogging opportunity. 
My name is Melissa Smith, and Beeminder has been critical scaffolding for me since 2015. 
I&#8217;ve used it to:
</p>
<ul class=\\"beelist\\">
  <li>
    transition careers (twice)
  </li>
  <li>
    relearn languages
  </li>
  <li>
    build a business
  </li>
  <li>
    establish a daily journaling habit that&#8217;s 4.5 years old and 265,000 words strong.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  (I&#8217;m especially proud of that last one!)
I’m a Beeminder user for the same reasons we all are: 
change is hard, entropy is real, and it takes a lot of focus and reinforcement to stick with new behavior.
</p>
<p>
  But what if habits weren’t so hard? 
What if you had an expert problem solver to support and troubleshoot your habits, systems, and processes?
</p>
<p>
  Maybe you’ve outgrown your habits and systems and need help making upgrades. 
Maybe you recently realized you&#8217;re neurodivergent, which explains why your systems never quite worked &#8212; they were built using guidance from people with a different operating system. 
Or maybe you are so burnt out that your brain sizzles every time you try to focus on the work that used to be your passion but is now impossible.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;Change is hard, entropy is real, and it takes a lot of focus and reinforcement to stick with new behavior&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  I can help! 
As a habit coach, I help people learn tools and strategies to live and work with less friction and stress. 
I learn my clients&#8217; strengths, and together we experiment to tweak processes to suit those strengths while removing the pitfalls that keep bogging them down. 
My coaching incorporates what I’ve learned about habit change, neuroscience, psychology, behavioral economics, gamification, and a lifetime of inventing creative solutions to get out of my own way.
</p>
<p>
  Here’s what I believe about supporting my clients:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    1. Sometimes we outgrow our productivity systems &#8212; or they&#8217;ve never comfortably fit.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  Our systems must consider and support our authentic selves, not shoehorn us into who we think we should be.
Many of my clients are neurodivergent and, like me, are autistic or have ADHD. 
We grew up learning time management and productivity tools that don’t support our unique needs, leading us to struggle to be effective and productive, often with significant shame.
</p>
<p>
  For example, a classic To Do List works just fine for many people. 
But what if looking at your list overwhelms you and sends you down an epic, procrastination-driven web crawl? 
I&#8217;ve got a quiver of different To Do List structures that can prevent this.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    2. What’s easy for one person might be hard for others.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  Many of my clients start off feeling embarrassed or even ashamed about their struggles. 
Astrophysics or fire science are easy, but tackling a stack of paperwork is nigh impossible.
Giving an hour-long presentation is a piece of cake, but going to the grocery store is torture. 
I helped these clients restructure what was hard for them or strategize to eliminate it.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    3. YOU don’t need to change, but your habits and tools might.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  Even your &#8220;bad&#8221; habits exist because they fulfill a need.
And that need is usually perfectly natural &#8212; part of our evolutionary wiring. 
Often, the first step towards effective change is observation and data collection to figure out what environmental triggers surround the issue. 
For example, many people struggle with getting enough quality sleep, but for some of my clients the root causes weren&#8217;t clear until they started filling out a shared sleep diary document, with lots of cheering and rewards from me. 
Once we analyzed the diary together, we could start incrementally testing out small changes to find what sleep rules worked for them.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    4. Our executive functioning needs scaffolding to make both brain work and drudgery more efficient, sustainable, and pleasureable.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  Especially for neurodivergent people, a core issue that regularly sabotages productivity is executive functioning struggles. 
Executive functioning is a bundle of skills &#8212; motivation, task initiation, focus, and more &#8212; managed by the prefrontal cortex of our brain.
Threats or big emotions like shame, frustration, or panic send us into our amygdala instead, home of the fight/flight/freeze/fawn response.
I help my clients understand that “be more disciplined” isn’t the solution. 
Instead we defuse and deconstruct the situation and figure out which tool might make discipline entirely irrelevant.
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"WILLPOWER1\\"
    href=\\"#WILLPOWER\\"
  >
    [1]
  </a>
</p>
<p>
  Difficulties with executive functioning can also impact anyone who is stressed, depressed, burnt out, or under pressure. 
We need tools to help our maxed-out brains focus on difficult intellectual work, especially when our brains are locked into a pattern where they think every task is an immediate threat to our survival. 
Otherwise burnout and exhaustion can turn even our easy tasks into all-day battles.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    5. Everyone deserves validation and a kind, supportive internal script. You might need to hear what that sounds like.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  We hear a lot of criticism over a lifetime &#8212; parents, teachers, bosses, frenemies.
Gradually, we internalize critical voices we hear, imposing on ourselves harsh expectations of unyielding perfection that we&#8217;d never accept from a boss or friend. 
This self-criticism not only makes life miserable, but also sabotages productivity, resulting in avoidance, procrastination, burnout, and dread. 
Eventually the jerk of a boss who makes you want to quit your job can be you.
I offer a gentler approach and direct clients to resources that foster deep work and self-compassion.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    6. Changes can be hard because old behavior is ingrained.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  One of my favorite analogies about habit change comes from the book &#8220;You Are Not Your Brain&#8221;. 
The author likens our neural pathways and habits to hiking trails. 
You can carve out a new trail at any time, but it takes work and dedication (and brush clearing).
The old, established path is always RIGHT THERE, beckoning us with its familiarity, convenience, and lack of plants with prickly thorns. 
I help clients spot the challenges in their new path, reassure them when they revert to the old path, and send rewards for reinforcement.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    7. Massive life changes may demand that you level up &#8212; fast.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  Sometimes life shoves you into the deep end. 
New parenthood, eldercare, or work duties can leave you drowning. 
I help clients pinpoint, prioritize, and troubleshoot solving the big problems. 
I provide extra brain power when it might be in short supply.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    8. Normalizing failure makes success easier.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  When relevant and helpful, I talk about my own failures and struggles with my clients. 
I&#8217;m not just theoretically familiar with habit and behavior change, but I constantly need to use the strategies on myself.
This means I can easily suggest strategies for whatever trips you up.
And I also deeply understand just how much reinforcement and structure we need to make things stick.
In addition to providing this practical support, my experience also reassures my clients that they are not alone in their struggles.
</p>
<p>
  <br>
  &nbsp;
  <br>
</p>
<p>
  But what does this coaching look like in practice?
</p>
<p>
  Let&#8217;s look at an example from my client Phil, shared with his permission.
He&#8217;s working on burnout recovery and wanted to take Wednesday afternoons off billable work to spend time on passion projects. 
For two weeks, he tried to take this time off on his own, but he just kept plowing on with his client work. 
In addition to our regular coaching hour, I suggested we meet for 5 minutes every Wednesday at 3. 
Having that specific hard stop, boundary, and little bit of accountability provided the structure he needed to start the habit.
</p>
<p>
  Phil had a great first week, but weeks 2 and 3 weren’t as satisfying; he floundered during his passion project time, overwhelmed by the possibilities of what to do. 
So I modified the terms of our check-in: now Phil shows up having already selected 3 sub-tasks to start with. 
That has been exactly the choice architecture he needs to have fulfilling Wednesday afternoons. 
And he knows I’m there to help him troubleshoot if he gets tangled up in his backlog again.
</p>
<p>
  Of course, this is just a single example from my work with Phil. 
If only burnout were this simple to fix. 
But he&#8217;s got me to help him mop up the aftermath of burnout and build new habits and skills to prevent it in the long term.
Every week, we talk about what went well, what needs a different approach, and what help he needs to figure out the week ahead.
</p>
<p>
  That&#8217;s a reasonable description of how most of my sessions work, but ultimately I adapt the structure to meet whatever my client needs.

  and getting to bed much too late.
Worse &#8212; and a problem that&#8217;s resistant to our usual solution of more beeminding! &#8212; is that with all the day&#8217;s deadlines at the end of the day, you can squander most of your working hours before you really hit your panic threshold.
</p>
<p>
  We realized it would make a noticeable quality of life difference for us personally if we were scrambling every day to get on our roads by 5pm instead of by midnight.
Even better, by picking each goal&#8217;s daily deadline you can get a pretty huge productivity boost:
Get some things done before lunch, others by 5pm. 
Maybe fitness goals have to be done by sunset, for those of us who kept finding ourselves running around the block at 11:30 at night.
Early birds may even want some things due early in the morning (though noon is the earliest for now; see Known Issues below). 
And of course there are many night owls who want to define their day to end at, say, 6am the next morning so they have the option to pull beemergency all-nighters as needed.

<p>
  Now you may be wondering what took us so long to implement this.
The reason is much less like
this xkcd
and more like a smallish mountain of technical debt.
Though, it is more involved than it seems, as a quick glance at our

<h2>
  Nitty Gritty
</h2>
<h3>
  Night Owls vs Earlybirds
</h3>
<p>
  We know lots of you have been excited for this feature.
Interestingly it&#8217;s for two distinct reasons:
Some of you want to define your end-of-day to be the wee hours of the following morning so you can pull beemergency all-nighters.
Some of you want your deadlines earlier to save your sleep schedule and/or social life.
</p>
<p>
  The key thing to understand is that whatever deadline you set, Beeminder considers it to be tomorrow as soon as the deadline hits.
You can still enter retroactive data, though if it&#8217;s an emergency day and the graph has already derailed then it&#8217;s too late.
The data&#8217;s accepted but won&#8217;t undo the derailment.
Regardless, any data timestamped after the deadline is displayed and plotted for the following day.
</p>
<h3>
  Akrasia-Proofing, aka, No Snooze Button
</h3>
<p>
  A tricky thing about choosing your deadline is preventing you from pushing the deadline back as it approaches, defeating the whole point.
  <s>
    For now we&#8217;ve simply akrasia-proofed the field, meaning you can change your deadline but it takes a week to take effect.
  </s>
  UPDATE: Our current solution is that if it&#8217;s within 6 hours of your deadline on an emergency day, it just doesn&#8217;t let you push the deadline back.
</p>
<h3>
  Caret Confusion
</h3>
<p>
  Because of the 3am grace period that we&#8217;d provided for getting your manually-entered data in to your goal, there&#8217;s been a
  <a
    href=\\"http://beeminder.com/faq#qtm\\"
    title=\\"Short version: You can submit manual data between midnight and 3am but you have to use a double caret and make sure to enter the data all at once since simply entering data causes the graph to refresh for the new day.\\"
  >
    long-standing confusion
  </a>
  about adding data after midnight and before 3am. 
As part of the new arbitrary deadlines feature we made all goals default to 3am for their actual deadline. 
[UPDATE: Now midnight is the default for new goals. Regardless, you can now enter data right up to the deadline and there&#8217;s no grace period after the deadline.]
That means that if you add data after midnight on a 3am-deadline goal, you no longer run the risk of derailing the goal. 
You can use a &#8220;^&#8221; to mean &#8220;today&#8221; or &#8220;right now&#8221; and it will do the correct thing (instead of remembering to use a &#8220;^^&#8221; for &#8220;yesterday&#8221;). 
In other words, for night owls, it&#8217;s not tomorrow until the deadline hits.
</p>
<p>
  That also means that when the deadline passes it&#8217;s passed and there&#8217;s no longer gonna be a big hazy period where you maybe have time to get it done still. 
In short, no more loophole!
</p>
<h3>
  Bonus: Timestamps from the API no longer bizarrely offset
</h3>
<p>
  For people consuming the
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/api\\"
    title=\\"Beeminder blog post about our API\\"
  >
    API
  </a>
  , 
we&#8217;ve had a longstanding issue where the timestamps returned with datapoints were rather unfathomable, and often, if you&#8217;re in a timezone other then US/Eastern, completely different from what you passed in.
We&#8217;ve got two improvements to offer: if you pass in a timestamp to the API, we use it as is (rather than contorting it as we previously did).
We also return a daystamp &#8212; basically just the date, but taking into account the deadline and timezone of the datapoint &#8212; since from Beeminder&#8217;s perspective all we care about is the
  <em>
    day
  </em>
  that the datapoint counts for.
</p>
<p>
  At the moment we haven&#8217;t converted timestamps from previously created datapoints &#8212; if that&#8217;s a thing you&#8217;re interested in, let us know! 
For the sake of tidiness we may run some updates in the coming the weeks to correct timestamps on old datapoints, or maybe that is something that should wait for a V2 of the API. 
And if these changes do break code you&#8217;ve already written, please let us know! 
We took a straw poll before releasing this and the consensus seemed to be &#8220;omg for the love of all that is holy just fix the timestamp business!&#8221;
But if it does negatively affect you we&#8217;ll fix things.
</p>
<h2>
  Veritable Paradigm Shift?
</h2>
<p>
  I know, can we get over ourselves?
The reason we&#8217;re so excited about this though, is that we view it as a big step closer to the holy grail of Beeminder as nannybot that tells you minute-by-minute what you should be doing.
You can have deadlines staggered throughout the day so you&#8217;re satisfying the beest hour by hour all day long instead of screwing around all day and flying into a frenzy of productivity as midnight bears down.
It&#8217;s the same problem Beeminder solves so beautifully at a larger timescale &#8212; forcing you to make progress day by day on long-term goals &#8212; now on a smaller timescale.
</p>
<h2>
  Known Issues
</h2>
<p>
  We came down to the wire on getting this deployed.
We made an $810 bet with the daily

  </a>
  subscribers that we&#8217;d announce this in time for our big third anniversary post tomorrow, and we decided arbitrary deadlines needed its own post before that.
So, here it is in the nick of time, but there are warts.
That&#8217;s also why it&#8217;s tucked away in Terrifyingly Advanced Settings for now.
(But by all means, put it through its paces and let us know of any other issues you find!)
</p>
<p>
  Here&#8217;s what we know of at this point:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    You can&#8217;t currently have a deadline before noon. 
We&#8217;ll be changing this but for now the interface isn&#8217;t good enough to make clear the distinction between, say, a 6am earlybird deadline and a 6am night-owl deadline.
I.e. all morning deadlines are of the night-owl variety.
  </li>
  <li>
    <s>
      The smartphone apps may be confused about time to derailment and graph color (red, orange, blue, green) until we push new versions of them.
    </s>
    UPDATE: Good news and bad news: we deployed a fix for the Android app which should hit Google Play in a matter of hours. (And done.)
    <s>
      There may be a more severe bug with the iPhone app that causes crashes. Let us know if you see that!
    </s>
    UPDATE: We&#8217;re back to just the iPhone app being confused about deadlines.
    <strong>
      FINAL UPDATE: Both Android and iPhone apps understand arbitrary deadlines now.
    </strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    Some autodata sources make this difficult by only giving us data at day granularity, which means we have to honor their notion of what the day boundary is. Or maybe we can work around it by adjusting the timezone in the external account. 
For now, you can only customize deadlines for non-autodata goals.
  </li>
  <li>
    Some of us are
    <em>
      very
    </em>
    used to the midnight/3am deadlines and we&#8217;re worried that people (including ourselves) may change deadlines and forget they&#8217;ve done so and accidentally derail. 
So we&#8217;re working on various ways to make the deadlines more in your face. 
And if you do accidentally derail because of this, definitely reply to the legit check to let us know!
  </li>
</ol>

    exponential roads
  </a>
  , 
but hear us out!
We&#8217;re getting rid of exponential roads. 
I know, gasp! 
We&#8217;ve already migrated the small number of exponential roads that were out there in the wild.
If you had one, it should be approximately the same as ever.
The main difference is your rates will be much larger numbers, since previously you were specifying the percent change, not the rise-per-day. 
The idea is to approximate exponential road curves by just periodically increasing (or decreasing, in the case of downward-sloping graphs) the rate of your road as you go.
</p>
<p>
  It&#8217;s not too late to argue with us about this, and please (for real) comment below or send us an email if you&#8217;re at all inclined to do so.
</p>
<p>
  If it sounds bad, we have ideas for badness mitigation, like a feature where you can specify an exponential rate and the equivalent piecewise linear road is created, with segments every week or every month. 
(With enough backlash we&#8217;d even consider relenting.)
</p>
<p>
  But that&#8217;s the thing. 
A piecewise linear road with month-long segments approximates an exponential road with more than enough fidelity for any practical purpose we&#8217;ve ever encountered in Beeminderland. 
And we figure reassessing the rate of your road monthly makes sense anyway. 
So we&#8217;re betting that the loss of the mathematical elegance of a perfectly smooth curve is going to be, if anything, a blessing in disguise.
</p>
<p>
  But, again, holler if you disagree!

By scrapping it we mean that you don&#8217;t need to know the term &#8220;freebees&#8221; or worry about buying them:

<h2>
  A Convoluted History You Needn&#8217;t Read
</h2>
<p>
  This whole Freebees thing is a remarkable example of the phenomenon of painfully, circuitously getting to something that in hindsight is obvious and simple.
</p>
<p>
  In the very beginning we implemented something ridiculous we called ephemeral goals where you chose up front to make a goal a temporary test goal meaning it would self-destruct and screw you, user, if you forgot you had said that.
That was no good at all, even if we&#8217;d come up with a good enough way to warn and remind you about the imminent self-destruction.
In any case we needed some way for you to try Beeminder before actually adding a credit card.
(UPDATE from the far future:

  &#8212; and ended up at a perfectly simple solution that makes all the right things almost always happen without any of the intermediate rube-goldbuggery.
</p>
<p>
  (I feel like writing code works that way. 
You keep adding duct tape and chewing gum to satisfy the different requirements and bugs that come up and then you gradually whittle it back down and end up with a few simple lines and it&#8217;s bewildering how you were too dumb to have just written that from the start.

<h2>
  The Catch: You Still Have To Add A Credit Card
</h2>
<p>
  If you skipped over the convoluted history then you don&#8217;t know the catch when we say you can now start all goals at $0 forever.
Which you totally can.
But the reason for all the historical convolutedness was that we needed some way to get you to actually put in a credit card at some point.
Until you do that Beeminder is stingless and pointless and when you derail there&#8217;s nothing for us to do but freeze your goal and let you stick your
  <a

    title=\\"Cranial Silicosis and Paths of Least Resistance\\"

  </a>
  .
It&#8217;s terrible.
</p>
<p>
  Also we like money.
But seriously, Beeminder needs to be a credible threat.
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"THREAT1\\"

    [2]
  </a>
  So the new solution is we just don&#8217;t let you create new goals at some point unless you add your payment info.
</p>
<p>
  What does &#8220;at some point&#8221; mean?
We&#8217;re finding that out, with Science.
As of this writing we&#8217;re randomly partitioning people into two groups:
those who can create exactly 1 goal before they have to add a credit card and those who can create 7.
</p>
<p>
  (Aside: We don&#8217;t think of it as a paywall since you won&#8217;t be paying unless you go off track on a goal.
We call it the commitwall.)
</p>
<h2>
  Reclaiming The Term &#8220;Freebee&#8221;
</h2>
<p>
  By the old definition of &#8220;freebee&#8221; &#8212; a goal with an initial pledge of $0 &#8212; freebees are now unlimited and free of charge for everyone.
Which is to say there&#8217;s no need for a word for &#8220;a goal initially at $0&#8221; at all.
That&#8217;s just a choice you make about any goal you create.
</p>
<p>
  But that term is so adorable that we can&#8217;t bear to throw it away altogether.
Beesides, it has a pretty natural new meaning in this new world order that&#8217;s almost the same as the old one:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    A freebee is a goal you create before you&#8217;ve entered payment info:
A goal with $0 pledged and that will just freeze if you derail.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  We put a version of that in the
  <a

  in case you forget.
</p>
<p>
  <br>
  &nbsp;
  <br>
</p>
<p>
  PS: To be extra clear, freebees become forrealbees as soon as you enter your payment info. 
They still have $0 at risk but if you derail they automatically jump to the next pledge level ($5) and continue to increase each time you derail until you hit your pledge cap.
(You choose the pledge cap when you create the goal now and hopefully it&#8217;s all nice and self-explanatory.)

  Announcement! 
Beeminder has stopped selling lifetime plans.
Obviously if you already have one, we will honor it forever and ever

  . 
We&#8217;re just not selling new ones.
We&#8217;ve thought about this hard and have five(ish) reasons:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Inability to give lifetime people premium credit
  </li>
  <li>
    Special cases and complexity in the subscription logic
  </li>
  <li>
    Lifetime plans take away your leverage as a customer?
  </li>
  <li>
    We don&#8217;t know how to price them fairly
  </li>
  <li>
    Commitmentphobia?
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  The premium credit reason is small but has been mattering more and more lately.
There are

    title=\\"We (Beeminder and also us personally as members of the Bee Team) pay users when we derail\\"

  and various

    title=\\"Our old Cyber Monday promotion. We don&#39;t do this anymore but we like the blog post\\"
  >
    promotions
  </a>
  . It&#8217;s extremely convenient to be able to pay a user money by adding credit and know that it really is equivalent to money because we&#8217;ll be adjusting their next premium payment accordingly.
(Fun fact: we pay interest, compounded continuously, on all premium credit balances.)
</p>
<p>
  Point 2 is code cruft, and it isn&#8217;t
  <em>
    that
  </em>
  bad.
We can just pretend &#8220;lifetime&#8221; is 1000 months and let our grandchildren worry about it.
Still, there are surprisingly many complications that arise in the code
(
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/fair\\"
    title=\\"Old blog post about our exquisitely fair discount slider\\"
  >
    and in the math
  </a>
  ). In a sense, point 1 &#8212; not being able to give lifetime folks premium credit &#8212; is an instance of this.
It&#8217;s another set of special cases we have to keep in the back of our minds in every situation.
</p>
<p>
  Point 3, about your leverage as a customer, isn&#8217;t really a reason from our perspective but may count as an argument against lifetime plans in general.
Having a lifetime plan means you can&#8217;t take your ball and go home.
The company has no incentive to care about you anymore.
Of course, that&#8217;s the (counter)point &#8212; you&#8217;re willing to get a lifetime plan from Beeminder in particular because you trust that we won&#8217;t be like that.

  Which brings us to point 4.
It&#8217;s true that we won&#8217;t be like that.
But that makes the price we need to charge &#8212; for quasi-committing
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"FP2\\"
    href=\\"#FP\\"
  >
    [1]
  </a>
  to support something
  <em>
    literally forever
  </em>
  &#8212; very high.
When we first realized we were selling lifetime plans way too cheaply we did jack up the price.
But that price was so high it made us seem like price-gouging jerks.
Not that we believe in the concept of price-gouging, but there&#8217;s more to it.
We&#8217;re actually currently working on a revamp of premium plans &#8212; though it&#8217;s still a big nebulous mess &#8212; and it&#8217;s possible that some premium perks will become free and that others won&#8217;t exist in the future.
</p>
<p>
  (This is the very ironically named point 5 &#8212; also kind of part of point 4.)
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;From a business standpoint, it was a horrible idea&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  We think that&#8217;s fair and a risk people took in getting lifetime plans, similar to the risk of Beeminder dying.
And we always bend over backwards to not break any existing use cases so it&#8217;s always been a reasonably small risk (especially the risk of us dying, now that we&#8217;ve been around this long!).
But as soon as we have even the inkling that perks could go away or become free, it doesn&#8217;t feel right to sell them for life anymore.

  Stepping back, remember how American Airlines sold a lifetime unlimited pass in the 1980s and later decided to just fork their customers in the ear?
That&#8217;s how I&#8217;d remembered it anyway, but
  <a
    href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAirpass\\"
    title=\\"How do you pronounce &#39;AAirpass&#39;? Maybe the first A is just silent.\\"
  >
    the Wikipedia page about it
  </a>
  has American Airlines coming out of it looking pretty alright, surprisingly. 
They revoked exactly two of the lifetime passes for what kind of sounds like blatant, cheaty abuse and are still honoring the rest.
</p>
<p>
  But my point is that, from a business standpoint, it was a horrible idea.

  &#8217;s 5-year &#8220;believer&#8221; plan seems like a nice compromise.
Beeminder currently has biyearly as our longest option.
</p>
<p>
  Anyway, so, yes, we now wish we&#8217;d never offered lifetime plans in the first place and are telling you (other startups) so you can avoid that mistake. 
Obviously we would never in infinity years rescind existing lifetime plans.
We have thought about how we could
  <em>
    fairly

  undo the mistake and &#8212; using

It mostly serves to illustrate that there just isn&#8217;t a realistic undo.
We offer it as a cautionary tale!

    your beeminder lifetime plan that we can take from your cold dead hands
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
    Hi userperson! This is not going to be at all what it sounds like if you only read the next sentence, so please don&#8217;t read only the next sentence! Lifetime plans have turned out to be a bit of a bugbear/boondoggle to support and we&#8217;re trying to get rid of them. Mostly that&#8217;s internal to us but one way lifetime plans actually suck from a user-perspective is that we can&#8217;t ever offer you premium credit for anything. You already have a literally infinite amount of premium credit! So&#8230; we want to make you an offer you can&#8217;t refuse.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
    (But we really want to emphasize that you absolutely can refuse it because you having gotten a lifetime plan was like an investment in us and your right to those premium perks forever and ever (or at least as long as they exist &#8212; we never said whose lifetime haha) is like equity you have in Beeminder. So if we don&#8217;t want to support lifetime plans that is 100% our problem, not yours. You&#8217;re bought in!)
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
    Which brings us to our offer, or two possible offers:
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      We convert your lifetime premium plan to a literal million dollars of premium credit which is
      <i>
        almost
      </i>
      the same thing but not quite. 
The &#8220;not quite&#8221; part
      <i>
        isn&#8217;t
      </i>
      that you might use up a literal million dollars of credit &#8212; and in the event of hyperinflation or curing death or whatever, we could and would just make it a billion or a trillion. 
Rather the &#8220;not quite&#8221; is that, the way we&#8217;ve implemented premium credit, it still charges $1 every month or year. 
We do that to have a better paper trail and also to just confirm that your payment method still works. 
We add the dollar back to your premium credit (and even pay interest on that balance!) so it&#8217;s all exquisitely fair. 
Except with an essentially infinite amount of credit it&#8217;s not fair because you won&#8217;t ever get those $1 charges back. 
So this offer would be to literally pay you a lump sum now that more than makes up for that perpetuity of $1 charges.
      <p>
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
  </p>
  <ol start=\\"2\\">
    <li>
      We give you a lump sum of money to fully buy back your lifetime plan. 
Please do not feel pressured to take this option! 
And if you do, please only agree to a lump sum that feels genuinely fair. 
After us buying back your lifetime plan you&#8217;d go back to paying monthly or yearly like normal.
      <p>
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
    The advantage of option 2 is that we can meaningfully offer you premium credit for things. 
For example, it&#8217;s an easier way to do refunds, or for referral programs or bounties or who-knows-what. 
Maybe one day we hire you! 
(Employees get premium credit now; we resisted that for a long time for dogfood reasons.)
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
    (Another, hopefully counterfactual, benefit: 
If we ever sold out or anything, it gives you the option to take your money and leave. 
With a lifetime plan you kind of have no leverage if we ever started really sucking!)
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
    The advantage of option 1 is it&#8217;s pretty straightforward and cheap to compensate you for the $1 charges and those checks on your payment method is a handy way to ensure Beeminder is always a credible threat.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
    Of course we won&#8217;t impose anything on you so if you ignore this email then we&#8217;ll just make it work the way we agreed and that&#8217;s that. 
But there are few enough lifetime folks that we&#8217;re hopeful that we can convince you all to make the switch and that will be a boon for us (and we think for you!).
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
    What do you think? 
Easiest way to reply is &#8220;sure, make me an offer!&#8221; and optionally add any other thoughts you have. 
You could also exploit anchoring bias and name an absurdly high price and we could negotiate down from there!
  </p>
  <p>

<p>
  So there you have it.
Or don&#8217;t have it, if you didn&#8217;t already get it.
A lifetime plan, that is.
Also that hypothetical email is not something we expect you to ever get because it&#8217;s just too messy, and probably too expensive.
(For example, a big monkey wrench is that option 1 is way too generous for anyone with a lifetime plan below the most expensive one.)
</p>
<p>
  To conclude, we shall now enumerate, for posterity and fairness, five arguments we collected from our users in favor of lifetime plans, even though we think the five contra arguments above outweigh them.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Going lifetime makes you feel bought in and committed.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Getting the premium payment out of the way maximizes the motivational impact of subsequent pledge payments.
It could be anti-motivating if instead of &#8220;risk paying $5!&#8221; it&#8217;s &#8220;risk paying $21 instead of the usual $16&#8221;.
(This one doesn&#8217;t feel too persuasive to me because I think normal people &#8212; er, normal Beeminder users &#8212; naturally think at the margin.)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      A couple lifetime folks suggested they might quit if they had to reassess Beeminder&#8217;s value every so often, which, ouch.
I don&#8217;t think they mean it though!
I do think there are arguments along these lines that apply to monthly payments but they apply much less to yearly.
And I think the option of biyearly payments mostly rebuts the pro-lifetime arguments I&#8217;ve heard of this form.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      A couple lifetime folks like the strategy of leveraging the sunk cost fallacy for Good.
Fighting irrationality with irrationality; I&#8217;m on board!

  Fine print: 
What we mean is that you&#8217;ll have your lifetime plan forever and ever to whatever extent those perks exist in Beeminder.
For example, we could conceivably decide that pledgeless goals should just not be a thing and in that case the Beemium people who paid for that feature could be out of luck.
We&#8217;re very reluctant to tell people they&#8217;re out of luck but we have to be focused on what&#8217;s best for Beeminder long-term and not have
  <em>
    too
  </em>
  many balls chained to our ankles.
(Pledgeless goals are just an example and we don&#8217;t [as of 2021] actually plan to get rid of them. 
We&#8217;re just not making infinitely long commitments to specific features, is the point.
And if we do kill a feature you specifically paid for, we&#8217;ll bend over pretty far backwards to make it fair.)

<h3>
  &#8220;Potentially Paying Customers&#8221;
</h3>
<p>
  We ended the last blog post with what you might think is an unfortunate epithet for new Beeminder users.
Being buried at the end of a bunch of nitty-gritty about business reasons for the timing of collecting payment info, 
approximately zero percent
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"MOM1\\"
    href=\\"#MOM\\"
  >
    [1]
  </a>
  of people noticed it, until we had to go and lead with it in this blog post.
</p>
<p>
  But I want to really double down on it!
</p>
<p>
  We&#8217;ve argued before that Beeminder&#8217;s incentives are not at all as
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/perverse/\\"
    title=\\"Beeminder blog post about our seemingly perverse incentives\\"
  >
    perverse
  </a>
  as they seem. 
If Beeminder didn&#8217;t help you succeed at your goals then you&#8217;d stop using it. 
We&#8217;d have to be very myopic (and certainly wouldn&#8217;t have survived 7 (!) years) to want to make people more likely to fail.
</p>
<p>
  Still, it would seem too convenient to be true if maximizing Beeminder revenue and maximizing user awesomeness were always entirely congruent. 
Well, being a fan of simultaneously having and eating cake, I&#8217;ve got an argument for exactly that congruency.
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"MEX1\\"
    href=\\"#MEX\\"
  >
    [2]
  </a>
</p>
<p>
  Here it is. 
As a user, your tolerance for paying Beeminder scales with the value you derive from it. 
And the kicks in the butt, the stings, are where all the motivation comes from. 
If they&#8217;re excessive then you&#8217;ll quit or make your goal too easy. 
Which sacrifices both revenue and awesomeness. 
(And if the amounts of money you risk are too low, of course, they won&#8217;t actually motivate you.)
What maximizes both revenue and awesomeness is being right below that threshold &#8212; motivating amounts of money that you&#8217;re willing to keep paying because of how much progress you&#8217;re making on your goals.
</p>
<p>
  Maybe the key to seeing Beeminder&#8217;s incentives as wholly non-perverse is to remember that derailing does not equal failing. 
Derailing is a lot of things &#8212; 
a kick in the pants, 
paying for an

    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/beenice\\"
    title=\\"Beeminder blog post by Bee about treating yourself to derailments sometimes\\"
  >
    immediate break
  </a>
  because the goal has been really hard, 
valuable information about how realistic the goal is &#8212; 
none of which have anything to do with failing. 
The only ways to fail are to quit the goal, to set the
  <s>
    yellow brick road
  </s>
  bright red line to something stupidly easy, or to

</h4>
<p>
  What do you think? 
I&#8217;m being serious now, and if we could convey that to users then we could unabashedly say that heck yes, 
Beeminder&#8217;s objective is to maximize your derailments, and at the maximum amount of money you can tolerate!
(Maximize your long-term derailing, I mean. See again the footnote about Mexico
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"MEX2\\"
    href=\\"#MEX\\"
  >
    [2]
  </a>
  which in fact minimizes long-term revenue!)
Put that way it sounds ridiculous but, for typical users, it&#8217;s equivalent to maximizing the amount of progress on the actual thing you&#8217;re beeminding. 
That&#8217;s worth paying for.
</p>
<h3>
  Extremes
</h3>
<p>
  I like taking things to extremes so, now that we&#8217;ve reached the nitty-gritty portion of the post that no casual passersby will read, let&#8217;s see how that might look!
What if we really went all out with trying to get you to derail more?
Instead of or in addition to premium features, we could dangle carrots like this:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    You need to pay $X more in derailments before unlocking the whizboggle feature.
    <strong>
      Go make some goals more ambitious!
    </strong>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Probably at this point I&#8217;m not serious but a little bit I still am. 
The reason not to take it this far is to not dilute Beeminder&#8217;s sting.
More derailments are legitimately great, but not if they&#8217;ve been incentivized or otherwise made to be less painful when they happen.
It&#8217;s great when it&#8217;s due to making your goals more ambitious and getting more done or being more awesome &#8212; accomplishing more of what you set out to when creating your Beeminder goal in the first place.
</p>
<h3>
  Once More, With Feeling: Derailing Is Not Failing
</h3>
<p>
  Let me get back to full seriousness:
Not only is derailing not failing, it&#8217;s quite the opposite.
Pushing yourself hard enough that you sometimes derail is great for us and great for you.
You don&#8217;t know how much more you could be accomplishing unless you sometimes find your limits!

A lot of it seems to contradict my thesis here.
I&#8217;m not sure it does as much as it seems to but it has convinced me that this is just a part of the picture and Beeminder&#8217;s power and flexibility continue to amaze me.

  Fun fact: Exactly one user complained and it was my mother.
She wasn&#8217;t exactly complaining, just worried that it might sound kind of cynical or money-grubby of us.

  Exceptions apply. 
If we lock everyone out of their goals, collect all the derailment money, and flee to Mexico, that could count as revenue being incongruent with users&#8217; awesomeness.

  There&#8217;s one more failure mode, thankfully rare, but it is an exception to the titular claim: 
Sticking your head in the sand and just letting the derailments rack up without doing any more work on the goal than you would&#8217;ve without Beeminder. 
When that happens it&#8217;s typically due to actual depression and we&#8217;ve got a

  An under-appreciated fact about Beeminder is that it doesn&#8217;t force you to do anything.
It just puts prices on things and you continue to do whatever you feel like doing, factoring in those prices. 
Just like you might buy a box of cookies if the price is right.

  As long as what you end up paying Beeminder is low relative to how much more awesome you are because of Beeminder, it&#8217;s a good deal.
</p>
<p>
  That is the philosophy of Paying Is Not Punishment.
</p>
<p>
  We&#8217;ve been making related points for a long time.
Bee&#8217;s classic

    title=\\"Excerpt: It&#39;s a simple decision: how much do I value *not running* right now? If it is less than $10 then I&#39;ll run. If it is more, I&#39;ll pay. If I get up to $90 pledged and I still don’t want to go running, then I will re-evaluate why I am trying to get myself to run in the first place.\\"

  &#8221; post argues that not only is paying not punishment &#8212; it&#8217;s literally a treat.
Treating yourself to a derailment once in a while is a perfectly legitimate choice for spending your money.
As with the box of cookies, you just want the price to be high enough that you don&#8217;t buy them every day.
</p>
<p>
  A bit more recently on the blog, we explained how
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/defail\\"
    title=\\"Aka Beeminder Revenue Proportional To User Awesomeness\\"
  >
    Derailing Is Not Failing
  </a>
  .
Paying Is Not Punishment turns that up to eleven.
To recap, derailing on a Beeminder goal just means a little kick in the pants and some respite and renewal of the commitment.
That is not remotely like failure. 
Failure is setting your goal so unambitiously that you never derail, and don&#8217;t accomplish any more than you would have without Beeminder. 
In fact, it&#8217;s empirically true that, overall, the more you&#8217;re derailing the more awesomeness Beeminder is inducing.
</p>
<p>
  Yes, that is a very self-serving thing for the creators of Beeminder to emphasize, since those derailments are how we make money.
But that&#8217;s our point: Beeminder is not as
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/perverse/\\"
    title=\\"Beeminder blog post about our seemingly perverse incentives\\"
  >
    perverse
  </a>
  as it seems.
The better Beeminder makes your life &#8212; the more words you write, steps you take, junk food you forego &#8212; the more you tend to pay us and it&#8217;s all very win-win.
</p>
<p>
  Which brings us to what this post is really advocating for, namely, a no-excuses mindset, for at least some people and some Beeminder goals.
Or to flip that around, it&#8217;s advocating against a mindset of 
&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t pay for this derailment because it wasn&#8217;t my fault&#8221;.
There&#8217;s no fault. 
You just voluntarily enter into a contract in which you pay money for allowing your datapoints to cross a bright red line. 
If you cross it, you owe the money &#8212; exactly as agreed and thus perfectly fair. 
The fact that you want to minimize those payments is what induces all the awesomeness you&#8217;re achieving by beeminding.
</p>
<p>
  The universe may conspire against you but a derailment is a derailment.
Paying is not a punishment that you deserve or don&#8217;t deserve. 
It&#8217;s just how the commitment contract is set up. 
If you zoom out from the trees that are the particular circumstances of this derailment, the forest is that you&#8217;re accomplishing all these things over the course of years with Beeminder-boosted motivation and the more you tamper with that motivation, like by questioning whether a given derailment was deserved or not, the less power it has. 
You want to maintain the nice clean property that crossing this red line is inherently costly.
No exceptions or excuses. 
Then the incentives are pristine. 
At least that&#8217;s the hardcore extreme version.
</p>
<p>
  For me, personally, the extreme version even works with things like illness. 
Maybe I&#8217;m sick enough that I&#8217;d rather pay this $X pledge than write this TPS report. 
Or maybe I prefer to suck it up and get it written. 
It&#8217;s a well-defined choice I can make. 
Beeminder just consistently exerts its motivational pressure.
</p>
<p>
  I know some people really hate that way of looking at it though. 
Like, &#8220;if the universe can randomly conspire against me and make me derail then I lose motivation&#8221;. 
Or &#8220;I actively want to conceive of derailments as punishment and if they don&#8217;t feel fair then Beeminder is like a capriciously punitive jerk and I want to rebel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
  Again, my extremery does not work for everyone, especially not when it comes to illness!
Just think about consistent, pre-decided rules and heuristics of your own that are as simple as possible (but not simpler).
</p>
<h3>
  What about flexibility?
</h3>
<p>
  Not everything needs to be hardcore and extreme and I know that some of our most amazing users could not afford to do that on all their goals.
The flexibility Beeminder offers in terms of allowing for
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/sos/\\"
    title=\\"Mostly outdated Beeminder blog post from over 10 years ago, of historical interest\\"
  >
    extenuating circumstances
  </a>
  can be insanely valuable (also kind of expensive for us, of course, but it works out fairly).
But this less flexible framing can be valuable and powerful for many of us.
</p>
<p>
  Of course really there&#8217;s a whole continuum here.
A middle ground might be something like, as our

  </a>
  once put it,
would you make this excuse to your supervisor and feel like a professional? 
If not, then maybe don&#8217;t make it to Beeminder either.
</p>
<p>
  Wherever you put yourself on that continuum, Beeminder is amazing at creating
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/flexbind/\\"
    title=\\"Ten-year-old Beeminder blog post on Flexible Self-Control\\"
  >
    maximally flexible commitment contracts
  </a>
  .
Namely, Beeminder&#8217;s one-week akrasia horizon allows you to lock yourself in only for the upcoming week, with the option to change your commitment at any time, taking effect a week from now.
That feature alone puts Beeminder contracts miles ahead of
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/competitors\\"
    title=\\"Comprehensive (as far as we know) list of Beeminder competitors\\"
  >
    everything else
  </a>
  in terms of flexibility.
That&#8217;s true even in the case that you allow yourself zero flexibility in terms of excuses!
But an
  <em>
    infinitely
  </em>
  flexible commitment isn&#8217;t a commitment.
</p>
<p>
  If your (meta) goal is to commit to doing X but only when X is the optimal thing to do, that&#8217;s just never going to be perfectly achievable (for those of us who need commitment devices in the first place).
If you can costlessly drop a commitment when you deem dropping it to be the optimal choice then you&#8217;ll end up making that choice suboptimally.
</p>
<p>
  ​In general, the more severe one&#8217;s akrasia, the more costly commitment devices will be but also the more valuable they will be. 
Maybe you need $270 at stake for each little task that keeps your life from falling apart. 
Even if you never derail at that amount, you&#8217;re paying dearly in attention and opportunity costs.
But the benefit is your life not falling apart, so that cost is worth it.
</p>
<p>
  In short, the greater the cost of the commitment device, the greater the net benefit.
And commitment devices always inherently have some cost.
</p>
<p>
  A pet peeve of mine when doing Beeminder support (not that this has happened in a long time that I&#8217;ve seen), is when a user argues that a derailment is not legit because circumstances became such that derailing was the objectively optimal decision. 
To make up an example: 
&#8220;I was super in the zone with my dissertation so it made sense not to disrupt my flow with teeth-brushing&#8221;.
And it&#8217;s not that they&#8217;re necessarily wrong about what&#8217;s objectively optimal.
Just that the power of commitment devices comes with a cost and it&#8217;s worth paying it. 
That could mean literally paying for the derailment or it could mean dispatching the beemergency at the expense of some productivity.
</p>
<h3>
  The brightest bright lines
</h3>
<p>
  By setting up a fully automated commitment mechanism I don&#8217;t touch any slippery slopes like deciding after the fact what counts as a legit derailment. 
If I&#8217;m derailing too often, I adjust the commitment, subject to the akrasia horizon. 
But the commitment &#8212; in this framing &#8212; is always the simplest, most bright-line-iest possible thing: 
&#8220;keep your datapoints above this literal bright line&#8221;. 
Sometimes I&#8217;ll derail blamelessly in a sense, but who cares?
It just means the commitment mechanism isn&#8217;t perfectly efficient. 
No commitment mechanism ever is. 
Trying to eke out the additional efficiency of &#8220;derailing doesn&#8217;t count if it wasn&#8217;t my fault&#8221; is playing with fire.
</p>
<p>
  And sure, I can pre-decide in my fine print about circumstances for calling non-legit but the slope is still a little slippery that way. 
Ambiguities can creep in. 
I can be tempted to look for ways to apply the fine print instead of focusing on keeping my datapoints above the line. 
(Also it just tends to feel more hard core and high-integrity to accept any and all derailments, but I&#8217;m highly biased here.)
</p>
<p>
  This isn&#8217;t the only philosophy.
As we concluded at the end of

  , people improve their lives in a
  <em>
    lot
  </em>
  of different ways with Beeminder!
My sense is the no-excuses, non-punitive mindset tends to correlate with greater user-awesomeness, but sometimes it&#8217;s the opposite.

Because you start to redefine what counts as tired or unavailable “enough” and start applying to more and more questionable situations. In contrast, the “taxing” system doesn’t give a f*ck about your excuses. You’re too tired or too sick or too busy to go work out? Doesn’t matter, pay up. The paying up is a clear demonstration that you’d prefer eating the penalty, and is a good and honest demonstration of what your capabilities are that day. Sometimes this system can be too harsh, like if you have the flu and it’s literally impossible to comply with your commitment contract.\\"

We mean you pass your deadline &#8212; midnight by default &#8212; with today&#8217;s datapoint in the red.
Here&#8217;s an example of a goal right at the end of the day. 
The countdown has run out, and I still haven&#8217;t done my flossing:

Three things happen when you pass the deadline and you still haven&#8217;t done the thing you&#8217;re beeminding.

  down to meet you where your latest datapoint is (or up in the case of a weight loss or Do Less goal).
You also get a week of flat spot.

    title=\\"Back on the horse, so to speak. If horses ran on rails. The yellow brick road is now flat until the Akrasia Horizon. The Akrasia Horizon is the point after which you can make changes to your goal, including ending it altogether.

But by default you'll be on the hook again when the safety buffer runs out.\\"
    class=\\"aligncenter\\"
  >
</p>
<p>
  This is so that you aren&#8217;t stuck playing catch-up to a goal you&#8217;re already behind on.
But more than that, you&#8217;ve got a week of break which you can use to take a vacation, make changes to your goal like changing the rate, or even quitting altogether.
Or you can start working to keep that new safety buffer.
</p>
<p>
  If you don&#8217;t want to be allowed to slack off for a week, you can check the &#8220;No Mercy Recommit&#8221; checkbox in the goal&#8217;s settings. 
Then your road will still jump to where you are currently, but it will continue upward at your previous rate from that point forward, with no flat week. 
Like this:

    class=\\"aligncenter\\"
  >
</p>
<p>
  Again, even at its most merciless Beeminder never expects you to catch back up to the original road.
Beeminder enforces daily progress and if you fall short and get stung (i.e., charged money) the slate is wiped clean and you continue from where you are.
</p>
<h2>
  2. You Get Charged Money and Your Pledge Increases
</h2>
<p>
  We charge your credit card for the amount you have pledged (usually $0 initially), and we increase your pledge to the next level.
It gets expensive fast, from $5 to $10 to $30, $90, $270, $810. 
If $810 sounds insanely expensive to you, don&#8217;t worry! 
It&#8217;ll only get that high if you want it to, because once you reach an amount of money that is sufficiently motivating, you can opt out of further increases in your pledge by setting your &#8220;pledge cap&#8221;.
You set your pledge cap as part of creating the goal, but you can change it in your goal settings any time you like.
</p>
<p>

    title=\\"Set the pledge cap to something you definitely don't want to ever pay. Not to be confused with the most you want to pay.

    class=\\"aligncenter\\"

</p>
<p>
  Our advice is to set the pledge cap to something scary enough that you&#8217;re motivated to never let it actually get that high.
But also not so scary that you&#8217;d rather quit Beeminder than have that amount at risk.

  pledge schedule is so you quickly get to a motivating pledge with minimal wasted money on amounts that aren&#8217;t motivating enough.
</p>
<h2>
  3. We Send a Legit Check Email
</h2>
<p>
  We email you to let you know you derailed and that we are about to charge you.
You can&#8217;t opt out of these emails.
This is us asking if the derailment was legitimate. 
If you forgot to enter data, or you configured the goal all wrong, or there was something you didn&#8217;t understand, or a hurricane knocked out your power, or anything at all that you&#8217;d count as a technicality, simply reply to that email!
If you say the derailment wasn&#8217;t legitimate (and say why), we&#8217;ll cancel the charge and undo the derailment.
You have 24 hours to respond to the legitimacy check before the charge goes through! 
(We can refund a charge that&#8217;s already gone through, if you had an emergency and couldn&#8217;t respond in time, but that&#8217;s more of a pain for both you and us, as you can imagine.)
</p>
<p>
  If you want us to hold you to a higher standard you can check the
  <em>
    Weaselproof me
  </em>
  box in the goal&#8217;s settings. 
Then we might ask for additional proof of your exceptional circumstances, such as a snapshot of you with your doctor, or a tweet or other public announcement of your excuse, for example.
In other words, if your goal is weaselproofed then we won&#8217;t just blindly believe you that the derailment didn&#8217;t count.

  Wouldn&#8217;t that kind of &#8220;flexibility&#8221; defeat the whole point of a commitment contract?
Not necessarily!
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;We immodestly think this is an ingeniously simple way to get the best of both worlds &#8212; meaningful commitment with almost total flexibility.&#8221;

<p>
  We went a little overboard in
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/akrasia\\">
    analyzing the fundamental reasons for akrasia
  </a>
  &#8212; why it is that you need a commitment device to reach your goal in the first place.
But it led us to what we immodestly think is an ingeniously simple way to get the best of both worlds &#8212; meaningful commitment with almost total flexibility.
Let us explain.
First, recall the fundamental problem of akrasia: over-weighting immediate consequences.
When some of the consequences are immediate (the yumminess of this pie, the comfiness of this couch, the hilarity of these talking kitten videos) 
and some are distant (weighing less, being in better shape, getting a promotion) 
your decision-making is distorted.

When buying groceries online for delivery tomorrow people buy a lot more ice cream and a lot fewer vegetables than when they&#8217;re ordering for delivery next week.
</p>
<h3>
  Akrasia Horizon
</h3>
<p>
  What does that mean in terms of flexibility to change your
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/roadwidth\\"
    title=\\"Short version for those just tuning in: your Yellow Brick Road is the path to your goal, i.e., if you graph your progress to your goal, the yellow brick road defines bounds on how far you can deviate from a straight-line path to it\\"
  >
    yellow brick road
  </a>
  ?
Simply this: there&#8217;s no harm in changing your mind about the steepness of your yellow brick road as long as you&#8217;re only changing it starting a week from now.
We call that week your
  <em>
    akrasia horizon
  </em>
  : it&#8217;s the time horizon beyond which you can make rational decisions, undistorted by akrasia.
</p>
<p>
  Based on thus-far scant evidence, we&#8217;re treating one week as the universal akrasia horizon.
</p>
<h3>
  Road Dial
</h3>
<p>
  What that means for you, the Beemindee, is that you see this underneath your graph:
</p>
<p>
  <img
    class=\\"aligncenter\\"
    title=\\"Road dial\\"
    alt=\\"Road dial\\"
    src=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/dial.png\\"
  >
</p>
<p>
  We call that the road dial.
You use it to dial up (make steeper) or dial back (make shallower) your yellow brick road.
With the one-week delay of course.
Here&#8217;s what a newly dialed up road looks like:
</p>
<p>
  <img
    class=\\"aligncenter\\"
    title=\\"Road that has been dialed up\\"
    alt=\\"Road that has been dialed up\\"
    src=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/roadkink.png\\"
  >
</p>
<p>
  Note that you can change the rate to anything, including zero, to pause your road altogether.
You can even make it go in the opposite direction for a while.
Maybe you&#8217;re going on an all-you-can-eat-buffet-hopping vacation.
</p>
<p>
  You can also change the goal date to any date in the future that you desire, except within the coming week, or leave it effectively open-ended by setting it to a year (or twenty years) in the future.
</p>
<h3>
  Easy Street
</h3>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;The daily struggle to stay on the road does not induce you to touch that road dial.&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  You may be wondering how anyone could ever fail to stay on a yellow brick road that&#8217;s this flexible.
Here&#8217;s how: if you&#8217;re highly akratic.
Such a person may well find it a daily struggle to stay on the road.
Yeah, you can always choose to wuss out and flatten the road, but only starting in a week, which you don&#8217;t want to do.
You want to wuss out Right Now, dammit!
I mean, just for now, while you eat this pie, and then you&#8217;ll behave again.
No such luck though.
</p>
<p>
  The daily struggle to stay on the road does not induce you to touch that road dial.
You always want to make it easier &#8220;just for today&#8221; &#8212; which the road dial doesn&#8217;t allow &#8212; and you always think you&#8217;ll get your act together by next week.
</p>
<h3>
  Epilogue
</h3>
<p>
  Perhaps surprisingly, it took a ridiculous number of iterations to get to this point.
For the longest time we struggled with different ways to deal with the fact that it&#8217;s so often hard to decide what to commit to.
We tried many variations of having multiple yellow brick roads for a single goal, so that you could specify an ambitious goal as well as a bare minimum.
It was always too messy.
We think the road dial with an akrasia horizon is a big leap forward.
And it seems so obvious in retrospect!

  There&#8217;s a lot to be said for losing weight nice and gradually.
Though in practice &#8220;gradually&#8221; often means endless oscillating and no long-term net progress.

  In the case of procrastinating on youtube or not getting your butt off the couch to work out it may not be the immediate pleasure of the videos or the couch but the immediate pain of starting the work, or the workout, you should be doing.
Either way, it&#8217;s the immediate consequences distorting your decision-making, i.e., akrasia.

  Malcolm Gladwell famously observed that it takes ten thousand hours of deliberate practice to become an accomplished expert.
Deliberate practice can be hard.
But you&#8217;ve got to start somewhere.
And then you&#8217;ve got to keep up the momentum.
So if you&#8217;ve got a rough idea of what you want to be great at,

Both of his chief recommendations are things that you could beemind:

    every week, write a short story
  </li>
  <li>
    every night, read an essay, a poem, and a short story

  1000 nights later, you&#8217;ll have the tools to be a decent writer.
And 1000 nights is something that you can beemind.

  Losing Weight &amp; Getting In Shape
</h2>
<p>
  It&#8217;s worth spending a moment thinking about losing weight, since January is the peak month for gym memberships.
This is a long-haul life change.
Whether you&#8217;re a habitual gym-goer and want to up your game, or you just want to make sure you
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/gym/\\"
    title=\\"To Buy or Not To Buy a Gym Membership\\"
  >
    use the membership
  </a>
  , 
Beeminder can help.
</p>
<p>
  The new thing for me this year is this: I realised that weight is the outcome of eating and exercise.
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"DUH1\\"
    href=\\"#DUH\\"
  >
    [3]
  </a>
  So don&#8217;t just create yourself a weight loss goal with the swimsuit season in mind.
Make it more likely to become true by adding a goal about eating better, and a goal about exercising more.
</p>
<p>
  Of course, you can hook your
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/fitbit\\">
    Fitbit
  </a>
  or
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/runkeeper\\">

  up to a Beeminder goal, to make it easier to track.
And weighing in daily is easier if all you have to do is

<p>
  According to Seth Godin, every new project starts out exciting and fun and then it gets harder and less fun until it hits a low point (the dip) where it&#8217;s not fun at all.
But then it gets better again.
There are some things that are worth the slog, that if you persist with them, then your life will be meaningfully better.
Ask yourself, &#8220;is this something that will respond to guts, persistence, and investment?&#8221;
Beemind those things.
Do you believe that your future self will be insanely better off if you actually do
  <em>
    the thing

  more regularly?

Create a goal.
You can always

  Some of our beemindees have goals that directly contribute to their livelihood, to running their companies, or to getting a bonus.
That makes it relatively easy for them to compare value.
For their other goals, they have to go by feel, like the rest of us.
The real value is in how much you accomplish.

  I know it sounds obvious: eat less, exercise more.
We all know it.
Hardly anyone does it consistently and sustainably.
That&#8217;s exactly what Beeminder is for.
To help us do the things that we know we should do, that we want to do, that we can do, but that we just won&#8217;t get around to prioritising.
It&#8217;s not rocket science.
But it is magic.

  It seems like every time I talk about principles of software engineering to you all I get jaw-droppingly insightful replies. 
No pressure.
</p>
<p>
  Ok, if you google &#8220;documentation-driven development&#8221;, it seems to be a lot of people saying that documentation is so important that you should write it first blah blah blah. 
But I think there&#8217;s a deeper insight here that I want to run by you.
</p>
<p>
  Making design decisions &#8212; like deciding what to build &#8212; is really hard. 
(That&#8217;s not the deep part yet.) 
We live and breathe Beeminder and we wallow around in its code all day long.
Even if we were to establish design criteria like &#8220;reduce cognitive load&#8221; our first-line thoughts on these are different than our users&#8217;.
</p>
<p>
  Power users may live and breathe Beeminder all day long, but we know how the literal bits go together, which parts are wonderful, and which are eldritch abominations.
When coming up with ideas, we will naturally discount those which are difficult to implement.
Ease of implementation is good to factor in to the decision-making but not good if it shapes what the decisions even are and what ideas are even thought of.
</p>
<p>
  A trick that helps us decide what to build (we&#8217;re finally at the deeper insight part now) is to pretend the thing exists and fully write up how you&#8217;d describe it to users, both new and old. 
I&#8217;ve been surprised how much clarity I can end up with about the right thing to do by doing that.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;Pretend the thing exists and fully write up how you&#8217;d describe it to users&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  I sometimes call it blog-post-driven development even though I haven&#8217;t done this on the blog before, just beemails and forum posts.
</p>
<p>
  There are downsides to actually publishing the posts. 
When I floated the idea of
  <a

    title=\\"Blog post announcing the Commitwall: No More Beeminding Without A Way To Be Charged Money\\"
  >
    requiring a credit card
  </a>
  in order to create a goal, everyone freaked the frack out and we were too scared to do it for years.
Then finally we did and it was immediately obvious that it was way better and no one (well, maybe literally one person) minded a bit.
</p>
<p>
  But you can always write the documentation or blog post and not actually publish it until the thing it describes exists. 
Which is the point: let the documentation guide what you build.
I feel like I need to say it another way to drive home the profundity of it. 
Maybe in another language? 
So far I&#8217;m making it sound too obvious. 
I think the key, and the part that you need to try for yourself, is to put yourself in the mindset of the thing already existing and then start writing. 
That forces a lot of design decisions that you&#8217;d otherwise weasel out of making by writing things like &#8220;and then we&#8217;d either do X or Y&#8221;. 
Not allowed! 
Commit to a decision and see where the document goes. 
You&#8217;ll often back yourself into a corner and have to backtrack. 
Which is wonderful, to be doing that before any code is written instead of after.
It&#8217;s a lot like

      adding made-up data to your goals.
The problem they solve &#8212; Beeminder goals must derail if you ignore them &#8212; is as critical as ever but today we are announcing a better solution:
Auto-Derail.
    </em>
    <br>
    &nbsp;
    <br>
    <em>
      Auto-Derail is like PPRs but much simpler and much more draconian:
instead of gradually derailing you by eating through your safety buffer if you stick your head in the sand, we just force-derail you immediately if you hit your deadline without having entered data for that day.
It&#8217;s like an ultra-PPR, but doesn&#8217;t touch your data.
    </em>
    <br>
    &nbsp;
    <br>
    <em>
      And it doesn&#8217;t have to be immediate.
Auto-Derail is specified as a number of days you&#8217;re allowed to go without entering data.
By default this is zero for do-less goals, 30 for do-more goals, and 7 for weight-loss goals.
But you can set it to whatever you like.
You can effectively opt out of the whole feature, just like you can opt out of PPRs, by picking a huge number of days as your auto-derail.
    </em>
    <br>
    &nbsp;
    <br>
    <em>
      I personally (as user-me) am excited to have a zero-day auto-derail on do-less goals like my sugar consumption.
I used to let PPRs come through and then every couple days I&#8217;d correct them (if I could remember &#8212; otherwise I&#8217;d estimate or let the pessimistic amount stand).
Now I&#8217;m grateful for the greater discipline of a red goal screaming at me to enter my number by the deadline. 
It&#8217;s like any other beemergency this way.
    </em>
    <br>
    &nbsp;
    <br>
    <em>
      What about scheduled breaks, you ask? 
It&#8217;s already the case that you need to turn PPRs off before going on vacation. 
(Actually there&#8217;s a trick you can use to give yourself safety buffer for a vacation without turning off PPRs but it&#8217;s

        obscure
      </a>
      enough that it might as well not exist. 
The right answer to this is a future feature we call True Breaks.) 
So with auto-derail you just also have to remember to turn up your auto-derail to be more than the number of days you&#8217;ll be going offline.
That&#8217;s bad, having to remember to do that and especially having to remember to undo that when you come back, but since the previous status quo was as bad or worse in that regard we feel good about shipping this feature first and then improving scheduled breaks separately.

        a change in slope in your road can mean that PPRs take way too long to derail you
      </a>
      . With auto-derail there&#8217;s no uncertainty about how long you can go without entering data &#8212; on any goal, not just do-less &#8212; before derailing.
It&#8217;s exactly the number of days you specified.
    </em>
    <br>
    &nbsp;
    <br>
    <em>
      Here&#8217;s a big question you probably have at this point:
How does your graph indicate how close you are to derailing?
If you&#8217;re deep in the green based on how far above the the yellow brick road you are on a do-more goal, how does the graph reflect that really you&#8217;re in the orange because you&#8217;ve almost used up your number of days before auto-derailing?
I guess I better answer it!
The answer is that we&#8217;ve written new code (beautiful, shimmering new code) to make all the countdowns show the minimum of the normal countdown and the auto-derail countdown and we&#8217;ve overlaid a ticking time bomb graphic on any graph where the auto-derail is due to happen before the regular derail.
    </em>
    <br>
    &nbsp;
    <br>
    <em>
      Does that mean that a do-less goal will always have a time bomb on it regardless of the auto-derail setting?
Sigh.
Consistency dictates that it does.
It goes away when you enter a datapoint for today but you generally do that at the end of the day and the time bomb reappears as soon as your deadline is past and it&#8217;s the new day.
    </em>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Aaaand, emergency eject.
It was going so well and then things started getting pretty dicey.
If we were dead set on auto-derail we&#8217;d have our work cut out for us to flesh out that time bomb idea.
Instead, let&#8217;s move on to another approach.

      adding made-up data to your goals.
    </em>
    <br>
    &nbsp;
    <br>
    <em>
      Today we are announcing a simple solution:
When you create a goal to, for example, eat less sugar, we include a step where we say, 
&#8220;if you don&#8217;t tell us how much sugar you ate we&#8217;re sure as heck not presuming zero so tell us what we should presume!&#8221;
    </em>
    <br>
    &nbsp;
    <br>
    <em>
      Now PPRs are both less magical and less made-up, since you pick them explicitly.
You can also change them any time in settings.
    </em>
    <br>
    &nbsp;
    <br>
    <em>
      We encourage you &#8212; by which I mean the UI encourages you by defaulting to it &#8212; to pick a PPR of twice your daily rate, same as the previous status quo, because that has a nice property:
Just as with flatlining on a do-more goal, it means that you lose a day of safety buffer with each day that you ignore the goal.
    </em>
    <br>
    &nbsp;
    <br>
    <em>
      If you want to be forced to enter data every day on your do-less goals (as I personally emphatically do) you can just choose a PPR of (in my case of dessert/candy-minding) twice your body weight in sugar or whatever amount is more than any safety buffer you might ever accumulate.
    </em>
    <br>
    &nbsp;
    <br>
    <em>
      And you do have the choice to set your PPR to zero if you really want to.
We don&#8217;t think you should and mildly discourage that by still putting the ugly PPRs in your list of datapoints regardless.
We consider implicit zeros on a do-less goal to be anathema.
If a zero is being graphed on a do-less goal, it&#8217;s going to show up as such in your datapoints.
This also means you can no longer delete datapoints on do-less goals &#8212; only edit them.
    </em>
    <br>
    &nbsp;
    <br>
    <em>
      But as always, entering a real datapoint makes the PPR self-destruct.
    </em>
    <br>
    &nbsp;
    <br>
    <em>
      The hard part about this was generalizing all the graphing code to understand arbitrary PPR values, as well as the now special case of &#8220;whatever twice your current daily rate is&#8221;.
It&#8217;s also not great how many users will likely insist on picking ill-advised PPRs and make themselves infinitely safe, which may look weird or ugly on the graph, not to mention defeating the point of Beeminder.
But we&#8217;re all adults, right?
The interface makes clear that you shouldn&#8217;t touch the PPR setting unless you know what you&#8217;re doing.
    </em>
    <br>
    &nbsp;
    <br>
    <em>
      Bonus: Weight loss goals now work much better!
In the old status quo if you had a very shallow yellow brick road and then fasted or got sick and found yourself well below the road, you&#8217;d suddenly have an absurd amount of safety buffer and be able to stick your head in the sand avoiding the scale while actually gaining weight.
You&#8217;d back yourself into a corner where, by the time you finally had to weigh in, you&#8217;d be hopelessly above your yellow brick road.
(Many of us resorted to meta-goals until now, a separate do-more goal for actually stepping on the scale most days.)
Now, your &#8220;max daily fluctuation&#8221; is also your PPR.
So your weight-loss goal never lets you go long without weighing in.
    </em>

  That went better!
(The weight loss bonus part applies to auto-derail too, of course.)

    <br>
    <em>
      Fundamentally, the problem PPRs solve is to force you to enter data on your do-less goals.
Do-more goals don&#8217;t have that problem because if you don&#8217;t report on a do-more goal we presume you did nothing and that eventually derails you.
PPRs were a kludge to make that be true for do-less goals as well.
If you didn&#8217;t report on a do-less goal, we&#8217;d presume you did more than your daily rate. 
That would eventually derail you.

      Isn&#8217;t that overkill? 
Too much clutter on your dashboard? 
Confusing for newbees?
Yes, yes, and yes.
Which is why we hide the meta goal and automatically populate it.
As part of do-less goal creation we ask how many days per week you want to commit to adding data.
That generates the meta goal &#8212; a do-more goal that gets a +1 whenever you add a datapoint to the do-less goal.
    </em>
    <br>
    &nbsp;
    <br>
    <em>
      Then a miracle occurs.
We show you only your primary goal in most cases but give you access to the meta goal when you need it, without that being bewildering to newbees.

  Back to Reality

<p>
  It felt weird to write those.
I guess I&#8217;m not used to writing fiction.
Or it just weirds me out to write things that aren&#8217;t true.
And at least some of those fictional feature announcements can&#8217;t
  <em>
    ever
  </em>
  be true, since they contradict each other.
Which is the other reason it felt weird:
Writing each one I started to feel attached to it, like it was truly the Right Answer and the thing we really should do.
At least at first.
Then as I was forced to think it through well enough to cover everything users would need to know, the cracks started to appear.
Which is how I know that none of these proposals are ready to start building yet!
That seems obvious looking at the proposals now but it genuinely wasn&#8217;t until I went through this exercise.
</p>
<p>
  I&#8217;m now excited to debate with you all, both at the meta level, about blog-post-driven / documentation-driven / spec-driven development, and at the object level, about which of those fictional features we should actually build.

In fact you&#8217;ve utterly pwned them.
Evil laughter!
Not too evil though.
You don&#8217;t want to harm Complice&#8217;s users or anything.
You just want to make Marvin eat Complice&#8217;s lunch.
So you add a banner to Complice&#8217;s front page like so:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    &#8220;
    <a
      href=\\"http://amazingmarvin.com\\"
      title=\\"In case it sounds like I&#39;m making this up as an example, I&#39;m not! You should totally check out Marvin!\\"
    >
      Amazing Marvin
    </a>
    is a Complice alternative you might want to try!&#8221;
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  I would like to convince you that your evil plans will backfire and that that will literally do nothing but help Complice.
</p>
<p>
  I suppose I&#8217;m slightly exaggerating (maybe) about an actual &#8220;maybe use our competitor instead&#8221; banner, but my point is, there&#8217;s a whole list of benefits to openly talking about, helping, and linking to your
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/competitors\\"
    title=\\"Yay StickK! Yay DietBet! Yay Pavlok! Yay Habitica! Yay Boss As A Service!\\"
  >
    competitors
  </a>
  and the obvious downside &#8212; your potential users using a competitor instead &#8212; is a non-issue.
</p>
<p>
  What are the benefits?
Let us count them:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Creating the link between you and your competitor in people&#8217;s minds &#8212; so people think of you when your competitor is mentioned.
  </li>
  <li>
    Creating the link in the Googlebot&#8217;s mind &#8212; so you show up when people search for your competitors.
  </li>
  <li>
    Highlighting that the product space is populated, implying that you&#8217;re solving a problem worth solving, which helps convince users to actually seek a solution.
  </li>
  <li>
    Proving that either you genuinely care about the user getting their problem solved even if not by you, or that you&#8217;re just very confident users will choose you, or both. (Ok, or you&#8217;ve just bought into the argument that competitors help you and it&#8217;s purely Machiavellian.)
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  And what about the obvious downside, losing users to your competitor?
It&#8217;s a non-issue because 99.9+% of the internet has heard of neither of you.
When Marvin gets new users and more attention, almost none of that is at Complice&#8217;s expense.
In fact, mostly what happens when someone tries Marvin is that a new consumer of productivity tools is born, someone who&#8217;s now amenable to trying Complice as well.
That effect, of your competitor creating new users for you, dwarfs any user stealing your competitor may do.

We&#8217;re constantly pointing journalists to that list and mentioning it all over the web any time it would be too self-promotional to just pimp Beeminder.
And it&#8217;s a genuinely useful compilation of apps so it&#8217;s all very win-win.
(Or win-win-win-win: good for us, good for our competitors, good for potential users, good for journalists writing about such tools.)

      UPDATE 2021:
      <br>
      We&#8217;re pausing (most of) these dogfood bounties!
    </center>
  </h3>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
    We still like them in theory but it turns out we all derail often enough that the logistics of getting money from us to users is more than we can keep up with! 
We do personally enter our personal credit cards in Beeminder and get charged money like anyone else and, yes, for those of us with equity stakes in Beeminder, the sting is diluted and that&#8217;s suboptimal. 
But! It&#8217;s surprisingly little sting dilution due to how much inefficiency there is. 
We lose a big fraction to taxes and other overhead and all of us &#8212; including us founders &#8212; have, individually, less than 50% equity stakes each. 
Meaning that when Beeminder charges us, say, $90, a pretty large majority of that $90 is truly disappearing for us. 
In fact, when we were paying those pledges as dogfood bounties to users it was kind of a warm fuzzy feeling (plus the marketing value, etc!) that diluted the sting similarly to how you superfans have the sting diluted by the warm fuzzy feeling of supporting Beeminder!
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
    In conclusion, we believe in dogfooding as much as ever and we&#8217;re approximating it imperfectly but well enough by just using Beeminder exactly the way all other users do, even without these dogfood bounties.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
    PS: We floated this among Beeminder superfans and they nearly universally thought it sounded totally fine.

      <b>

      : 
The bounties keep you honest! 
They have value emotionally and in terms of optics.
This feels like one of those beautiful unique Beeminder scrupulous charms lost to the juggernaut of corporatization.
Also there&#8217;s a huge difference between &#8220;this pledge goes to someone else&#8221; and &#8220;this pledge goes to my own company&#8221;.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>
        DR
      </b>
      : 
First of all, I don&#8217;t feel like honesty/dishonesty comes into play. 
We&#8217;re at least striving to be 100% transparent about it all.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      As for that huge difference, it&#8217;s a fair point but note the surprisingly high fraction of a payment that gets lost to fees and taxes in the process of coming back to us as dividends. 
Even if we 100% identify with the company &#8212; like every dollar of benefit to the company brings us the same happiness as a dollar to ourselves &#8212; we lose a lot of money on derailments paid to Beeminder.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, I don&#8217;t feel like there&#8217;s much of a slippery slope here or that we&#8217;re remotely selling out or anything. 
I mean, strictly speaking, we&#8217;re holding ourselves to the exact same standards, using Beeminder literally exactly the way users do. 
Just that going beyond that to try to replicate the feeling of where the money ends up &#8212; that&#8217;s just more work than it&#8217;s worth. 
It&#8217;s not ideal, but not exactly damaging to not do that. 
Some superfans feel a real compulsion to derail enough to be contributing fairly to Beeminder (&hearts;) and that&#8217;s a similar kind of sting dilution and I think the answer is that we just accept that the sting isn&#8217;t pure sting and it&#8217;s ok, it still works.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <h4>
      Compromise?
    </h4>
    <p>
      Madge Castle also disagrees with us on this and has the following prudent proposal:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        What about mitigating the logistical burden by just automatically applying the bounties as premium credit for people?
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      That almost feels worse, since that&#8217;s a classic corporate way to pretend to be paying something when you&#8217;re not really. 
Especially when premium credit is worthless to
      <a
        href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/deathtolife/\\"
        title=\\"Death To Lifetime Plans\\"
      >
        lifetime folks
      </a>
      . 
We could make a new kind of credit &#8212; derail credit &#8212; but that&#8217;s a can of worms.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      Bottom line, the whole dogfood bounty thing is so fraught and messy in so many ways that I feel pretty fine about killing it, despite the wistful little pang.

  Some of the meta goals aren&#8217;t really things we&#8217;re beeminding exactly, just things we&#8217;re tracking.
Like number of users, engagement metrics, etc.
Other things, like blog posts and UVIs and things we&#8217;re doing to make Beeminder grow, are in fact high-stakes Beeminder goals.
You can tell which are which by whether there’s a pledge on the goal.

I&#8217;d only been doing that for a couple months then and it&#8217;s now been over 6 months and it continues to go swimmingly.
Of course it only works because I&#8217;ve made it a Whole Thing.
It&#8217;s far easier than counting calories but you still have to find a way to keep it top of mind every day.
</p>
<p>
  So today I thought I&#8217;d try convincing you to try something drastically less crazy &#8212; though perhaps still pretty hard &#8212; that I think applies to literally everyone.
</p>
<p>
  Story time!
For most of my life I ate whatever I wanted and was thin. 
Then one day I got old and fat. 
Well, half true &#8212; and I
  <em>
    would&#8217;ve
  </em>
  unambiguously gotten fat (truly,
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/allitimentation/\\"

  >
    there&#8217;s no ambiguity
  </a>
  there) but of course I have a Beeminder goal that prevents that. 
Instead I&#8217;ve had to stop eating whatever I want. 
I achieve that mostly by intermittent fasting, so that I actually can still eat whatever I want, just not all the time. 
That might not be the healthiest way to modify one&#8217;s diet 
(and this blog post is not recommending it! that was my
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/allitimentation/\\"

  </a>
  post) 
to avoid gaining weight but the point is, you should have the Beeminder goal so that if/when this metabolic tragedy happens to you, you don&#8217;t wait until you notice you&#8217;re overweight to make whatever dietary / fitness / lifestyle changes make sense. 
You&#8217;re forced to gradually make them day by day because you&#8217;ve hard-committed to keep your weight below Beeminder&#8217;s bright red line.
</p>
<p>
  Point being, becoming overweight and then losing weight is total insanity. 
Whatever high jinks you have to do to lose weight, it&#8217;s drastically easier and healthier if you do those high jinks to 
NOT GAIN IT IN THE FIRST PLACE. 
It&#8217;s too late, you say? 
You&#8217;re already overweight?

  </a>
  Hard-commit right now to not gaining any further weight. 
How or whether to lose weight is a secondary question.
</p>
<h3>
  What about underweight people?
</h3>
<p>
  Them too!
Or at least there&#8217;s a generalization of this advice that&#8217;s applicable to everyone. 
You can start with &#8220;what&#8217;s an upper bound on my healthy weight?&#8221; 
For many people that&#8217;s unambiguously something lower than their current weight. 
For me personally, I don&#8217;t know that it&#8217;s less than my current weight but, for sports reasons, I&#8217;m fully certain that I don&#8217;t want to gain, so my current weight is an upper bound. 
For others the answer might be your weight plus five kilograms or something.
</p>
<p>
  Regardless, all of us can take the answer to that question, apply the &#8220;max&#8221; function with our current weight, and set a Beeminder goal with a flat bright red line at that number. 
If your weight is too low, make another Beeminder goal to get yourself up closer to that upper bound!
</p>
<p>
  And, sure, in some cases it&#8217;s silly to bother with the upper bound if you&#8217;re certain your weight will never approach it. 
Or at least that it won&#8217;t do so without you noticing, so you can cross that bridge if you come to it.
But it can&#8217;t hurt, is the point.
</p>
<h3>
  What about people with eating disorders?
</h3>
<p>
  Even them!
Note the underlying assumption that whatever upper weight bound you set is a healthy one.
If the very existence of that upper bound, however far away it is, may trigger disordered eating then I take it back.
Don&#8217;t actually do this in that case.
</p>
<h3>
  The bottom line on the upper line
</h3>
<p>
  This has been a lot of words (it&#8217;s a dicey subject, ok?) to say something pretty simple: 
Establish an upper bound for your weight and hard-commit to not crossing it as you age. 
And if you&#8217;re losing weight, do the same thing to ratchet yourself, always locking in your losses.
</p>
<p>
  I know my opinions on weight loss are controversial but &#8220;don&#8217;t yo-yo&#8221; is something we can all agree on and that&#8217;s ultimately all that this advice boils down to!

<h3>
  What to do instead
</h3>
<p>
  It makes for a better graph and less weirdness overall, if you really want to never do a thing ever, to make a Do More goal where you enter a 1 every day for
  <em>
    not
  </em>
  doing the thing.
But that brings us to&#8230;
</p>
<h2>
  2. Never-Will-I-Not Goals
</h2>
<p>
  This is generally a Do More goal with a rate of 7 per week, for something where it doesn&#8217;t make sense to do it more than once per day.
Common examples are brushing your teeth
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"TEETH1\\"
    href=\\"#TEETH\\"
  >
    [1]
  </a>
  , flossing, writing in a journal.
Your dentist won&#8217;t mind if you floss twice a day, but in general building up safety buffer on this type of goal is sort of counter-productive. 
You can floss your teeth 6 times today, but it won&#8217;t make your teeth six times cleaner.
</p>
<p>
  This is part of a general admonition, especially for newbees, to be realistic.
</p>
<p>
  Another way to look at this goal type is that it&#8217;s the opposite of cold turkey.
Instead of
  <em>
    never
  </em>
  doing something, you&#8217;re committing to
  <em>
    always
  </em>
  do it.
But since you&#8217;re clearly not always doing it right now, you might find it a harder task than you thought.
And when you find it hard, you can&#8217;t take a day off without losing a buffer day that you&#8217;ll never regain. 
With the 7/week goal, there&#8217;s no forgiveness for ever having a lazy night where you do nothing but watch TV all night long.
That safe day &#8212; assuming you at least started the goal with some initial buffer &#8212; is gone, you can&#8217;t get it back, and you&#8217;re one bad day closer to derailment.

<h3>
  What to do instead
</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Set a realistic goal rate. 
Start with a rate that&#8217;s a bit more than what you&#8217;re currently doing and then dial the rate up as it gets easier to accomplish.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Before you start any goal, but
      <em>
        especially
      </em>
      for a really unforgiving goal like this, think about what you want to achieve.
Is it necessary to read three articles per day every day?
Is that significantly better than doing it five days a week?
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Another highly recommended tactic: pick a better metric than &#8220;days I did X&#8221;.
We call this the
      <a
        href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/whattomind/\\"

      >
        QS First principle
      </a>
      .
In the article-reading example above, it&#8217;ll be much more flexible (and more interesting!) in the long run to beemind &#8220;articles read&#8221;.
You can still have that 3/day goal rate, but if you happen to read 5 articles on Monday, those 2 bonus articles count to build up safety buffer!
You don&#8217;t get the extra credit when you&#8217;re tracking it as a binary goal, where you either succeed or fail each day.
And since you can restore used buffer by reading extra articles, missing a day doesn&#8217;t mean an unrecoverable slip towards inevitable derailment.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>
  3. Outcome Goals
</h2>
<p>
  The canonical example of this type of goal is weight loss, though there&#8217;s some ambiguity here.
Other outcome goals include number of pushups you can do in a row, or your typing speed.
Or maybe your goal is &#8220;write a book&#8221; which maybe you&#8217;re conceiving of as a one-off goal (see #7).
</p>
<p>
  The reason that an outcome goal will bite you is because when it comes down to a beemergency day, there is not single clear action for you to take in order to immediately affect the outcome.
</p>
<p>
  While there are plenty of people who successfully beemind weight, when you create a Beeminder goal to track your weight, you are beeminding the cumulative outcome of a bunch of other behaviors that you are implementing.
You are changing the types and quantities of food you eat, increasing exercise, improving sleep, amputation, etc etc to actually make the scale number change. 
(We still think
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/weighly\\"
    title=\\"Why Weigh (Daily)?\\"
  >
    beeminding weight is great
  </a>
  though.)
When it comes to a beemergency day, the cumulative total of those actions is enough, or it isn&#8217;t.
</p>
<p>
  Likewise for your max reps of pushups or typing speed.
You&#8217;ve been training for this, doing everything your coach said, your recovery is perfect, your mental game is dialed in.
But if you fall short one rep, one second, what to do? 
You can keep trying, but in some sense it&#8217;s out of your control.
You&#8217;ve done the prep-work, and now it&#8217;s game day, and you might beat the clock, or you might not.
</p>
<h3>
  What to do instead
</h3>
<p>
  This one is simple. 
Beemind something else.
</p>
<p>
  Think about what inputs lead to the outcome you want, and then beemind those instead.
For weight loss it might be eating more vegetables, or walking 10% more, or getting more sleep, or drinking less alcohol, or why not all four?
For pushups, beemind total number of pushups done, or max rep attempts. 
For typing speed, total words typed, or levels completed in a typing game.
For writing a book, beemind the time spent writing, or the

<h2>
  4. OMG-I-love-Beeminder-let&#8217;s-do-EVERYTHING Goals
</h2>
<p>
  This looks like someone creating 93 goals in the first day of signing up with Beeminder.
 
You can certainly turn Beeminder into a nannybot that tells you what to do with every hour of every day.
But there&#8217;s plenty of ways this could go wrong.
</p>
<p>
  Firstly, if you&#8217;ve got a lot of goals, you have to remember to enter a lot of data.
Entering a lot of data can be tedious and frustrating, and when you forget you fail
  <em>
    big
  </em>
  .
Even if the data entry is

  >
    automatic
  </a>
  , it may still be a pain to actually
  <em>
    do
  </em>
  all the things you thought you wanted to.
You can create 27 different goals so you finally learn to knit, floss in the morning, floss at night, call your grandparents every Sunday, read a chapter of a classic novel every day, read one non-fiction book per month, limit your time on Facebook to 15 minutes a day, check in on your bank balance once a week, take out the garbage on Tuesdays and Fridays, reach out to a potential client every weekday, sweep the kitchen three times a week&#8230;
BUT IT&#8217;S TOO MUCH!!!

  At least once, your day is going to get completely away from you and you won&#8217;t get to dispatch your 14 beemergencies.
Then you&#8217;ll either send me emails to undo 14 derailments, or enter fake data on 14 goals to avoid derailing.
The first option is a hassle for us both, and the second pretty instantly

  (at least for manual data entry goals).

<h3>

and what goals matter most to you right now. 
Beemind those, cut the rest &#8212; archive them away, or drop the rate to something more manageable.
Maybe it&#8217;s okay if you don&#8217;t make it all the way through the list of &#8220;100 Books Everybody Should Read Before You Die&#8221; and regift your knitting needles to a friend.
And it might be okay to call Grandma every

      .
Pick a sensible rate, and then cut it in half to start with.
You&#8217;re starting a new thing, and you can dial the rate up later.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Of course, there&#8217;s a beautiful counterpoint to this one, in the

  . If Beeminder is already the dashboard that keeps track of all the deadlines in your life, like it is for some of us, then putting every last thing into a Beeminder goal might work great for you.
Bee has goals that are really just in place of calendar reminders, like &#8220;take out the trash&#8221;.
Again, these warnings are targeted more toward newbees, or the less-than-fanatical user.
</p>
<h2>
  5. Beeminding Someone Else
</h2>
<p>
  Beeminder works as a behavior change tool for yourself.
Maybe you get excited about how awesomely successful you&#8217;re being with it, and you find yourself thinking, &#8220;you know who really needs to change their behavior? NOT ME!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
  Goals that rely on someone else&#8217;s behavior can come in a few different flavors.
One example is directly beeminding something someone else has to do for you.
Like the time that 11-year-old Faire insisted on making a goal to hug her little brother daily. 
She eventually fell off the wagon because she was at the whim of her younger sibling, and sibling dynamics happened, and he refused to give her a hug, and there was not much to do about it.
</p>
<p>
  Another way you could have a goal that relies on someone else is a joint goal. 
These could suffer a diffusion of responsibility. 
If you and your partner created a joint decluttering goal, you&#8217;re at risk of failing each other because, despite good intentions, it is not obvious whose responsibility it ultimately is.
Maybe you see it&#8217;s a beemergency day as you&#8217;re heading out the door for work (remember that? heading out the door for work? hi from early 2021!), and you see a cloth grocery bag left out by your partner, and you think &#8220;oh good, they&#8217;ll take care of that and we&#8217;ll be all good on the decluttering goal.&#8221;
Elsewhere in the same house, your partner notices the beemergency and glancing around sees two pairs of shoes that you left in the hall and they think that obviously you&#8217;ll dispatch the beemergency, since you&#8217;re the one who left shoes lying around.
</p>
<p>
  (None of us &#8212; of the three who helped get this blog post out the door &#8212; have actually tried a proper joint goal and Beeminder doesn&#8217;t make it easy.
That may change in the future!
We&#8217;d love to hear your experiences with joint goals.)
</p>
<h3>
  What to do instead
</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Reframe the goal as something that you have direct control over.
Instead of counting the times you hug your brother, count times you&#8217;ve offered him a hug. 
That reminds you to offer the kindness, but you aren&#8217;t going to wind up in a heated debate over whether an involuntary sofa tackle counts as a hug.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Pick a buckstopper for any sort of goal that has joint responsibility.

  6. Should Goals
</h2>
<p>
  Are there things you feel guilty about not doing?
Do you
  <em>
    want
  </em>
  to do them?
Maybe there are tradeoffs, so you both do and don&#8217;t want to.
Vegetables are healthy but you enjoy candy more.
Maybe being sweaty or out of breath is particularly unpleasant for you despite how good it is for you.
Maybe YouTube is more engaging than

  </a>
  .
</p>
<p>
  We sometimes hear complaints about Beeminder, along the lines that it&#8217;s self-blackmail or unhealthily suppressing parts of yourself.
You should take those warnings seriously!
If you aren&#8217;t certain that more exercise or more writing or less TV, or whatever it is, is optimal for you, maybe don&#8217;t beemind it.
</p>

  >
    Want-Can-Will Test
  </a>
  .
One way to make sure your goal passes is to make the rate extremely easy.
You unambiguously want to eat some amount of vegetables that&#8217;s a fair bit more than your current 3 servings per month.
You definitely want to study more than 5 minutes a day.
Start with such a lower bound and dial the rate up as long it still feels easy and valuable.
As long as Beeminder is making you do a bit more (or less, in the case of a Do Less goal) than you&#8217;d do if left to your own devices, that&#8217;s a win.
Think rationally about how much more than that to push yourself.

  Yes, you probably do brush your teeth more than once a day.
We&#8217;ll get to that!

The amount of people who beemind teeth brushing has always surprised me.
Beeminder may be the most effective impetus for oral health on the whole internet.
Was it difficult to remember without Beeminder poking you?
How often do you brush your teeth with Beeminder vs. without?
Has your dentist noticed the improved beehavior?
Do you even go to the dentist regularly?
If you beemind this, please email me at support and let me know why you do so.
I won&#8217;t judge you!

  This is not really true &#8212; you can use the road dial to schedule a break (or a rate change) any time. 
So if you really have a crappy day, you can schedule a one-day break to make up some ground.
But you can only do that starting one week from now, and if you don&#8217;t
  <em>
    do
  </em>
  the goal on your break day, you won&#8217;t get the buffer back!

  Restatement for emphasis &#8212; this is
  <em>

  my opinion.
I know one very lovely user who currently has 72 goals active and she makes it work for her.
You might be a superuser too, and I admire you for it.
But for us normies out there, it makes Beeminder more overwhelming and scary than helpful!

</blockquote>
<p>
  I hate do-less goals with a rate of zero, and I am here to convince you never to use one again.
</p>
<h2>
  The Situation
</h2>
<p>
  If you&#8217;re among the 98% of Beeminder users that have ever created (or considered creating) a weight-loss goal, you probably have a guilty pleasure food or two or twenty.
Maybe it&#8217;s the infinite candy drawer at your office.
Every day around 3pm, you find yourself pulling up to pick out a few Starburst.
You know it&#8217;s a bad habit, and you really need to stop, but it&#8217;s so hard&#8230;
But now you&#8217;ve found Beeminder, the perfect tool to curb your candy addiction!
You vow to
  <em>
    never open the drawer again
  </em>
  and create a goal to track it.
It&#8217;s a do-less goal, obviously, since you want to do
  <em>
    less
  </em>
  candy hauls, and the rate is zero, because you are
  <em>
    seriously done
  </em>
  with the candy drawer.
</p>
<p>
  (WARNING: heavily opinionated ranting ahead)
</p>
<p>
  But it&#8217;s not a do-less goal!
It&#8217;s a do-NEVER goal.
You don&#8217;t want to use the drawer less, you want to use it
  <em>
    never
  </em>
  .
There&#8217;s no goal type for that.
You could use a do-more or a do-less to accomplish it
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"ANY1\\"
    href=\\"#ANY\\"
  >
    [1]
  </a>
  , but I strongly
  <em>
    strongly
  </em>
  encourage you to try the do-more first.
Do-less goals have their use cases, and they can bee really awesome!
But they&#8217;re not the best tool for a do-never goal, and you deserve the best.
</p>
<h2>
  Why They Suck
</h2>
<p>
  Is it wise to start my rant rationale by pointing out significant Beeminder flaws, as I am a Beeminder employee?
Well, I&#8217;m doing it anyway.
Squeaky wheel gets the grease!
</p>
<p>
  Here&#8217;s a picture of a fresh do-less zero goal:
</p>
<p>
  <img
    class=\\"aligncenter\\"
    alt=\\"Boring flat graph with everything at zero\\"
    title=\\"Boring flat graph with everything at zero\\"
    src=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/flat-graph.png\\"
  >
</p>
<p>
  My datapoint starts out on track, right on the bright red line, and the line&#8217;s not moving, because its rate is zero.
In Beeminder&#8217;s brain, I&#8217;m already
  <em>
    totally in the clear
  </em>
  forever even if I immediately forget about this goal and never touch it again.
This problem is what triggered the creation of
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/less\\"
    title=\\"PPR introduction blog post of yore\\"
  >
    Pessimistic Presumptive Reports
  </a>
  . 
I&#8217;ll rant on PPRs in the next point.
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    (Update from the future!
This part of Chelsea&#8217;s rant lamented how hard it was to actually get reminders on a do-zero goal.
But as long as you leave Pessimistic Presumptive Reports alone, her rant doesn&#8217;t apply.
We

    >
      fixed this part of the problem in 2019
    </a>
    . Phew!)
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    (Next was Chelsea&#8217;s PPR rant.
But this is also not too applicable to modern Beeminder.
Imminent PPRs are made visually clear on your graph and everything.
No surprises.
Again, just don&#8217;t turn PPRs off.
As Chelsea put it, 
if you happen to have even mild
    <a

    >
      weasel
    </a>
    tendencies &#8212; weaseling-of-omission vs weaseling-of-commission &#8212; then you really need those PPRs.
Otherwise you can stick your head in the sand and your Beeminder goal will have zero sting, never derailing unless you explicitly cause it to derail, by adding data.
Moving on to the still-true parts&#8230;)
  </em>
</p>
<h3>
  1) No motivating graph power
</h3>
<p>
  A mostly-successful do-zero goal looks like this:
</p>
<p>

    alt=\\"Example do-less goal\\"

  >
</p>
<p>
  Maybe it&#8217;s just me, but I enjoy the &#8220;climbing a mountain&#8221; feel of #2 more than the &#8220;nothing is happening&#8230; oh but that&#8217;s good&#8221; of #1.
(So does

If the hand-wavy graph image unmeasurable &#8220;motivation&#8221; factor doesn&#8217;t do it for you, perhaps you&#8217;re more interested in the cold hard cash factor&#8230;
</p>
<h3>
  2) They&#8217;re not free
</h3>
<p>
  Is it wise to point out something that might result in fewer Beeminder subscription dollars, as I am a Beeminder employee?
I&#8217;m doing it anyway.
(Subscribe to Infinibee to show your gratitude for my forthrightness and customer advocacy!)
</p>
<p>
  Do-less goals are a feature of the Infinibee plan.

<p>
  If you were already premium, this obviously doesn&#8217;t matter so much.
And thanks for your support, we love you! &lt;3
</p>
<h3>
  3) Breaks are weird
</h3>
<p>
  I couldn&#8217;t figure out a flowing witty transition into this one, but
on a do-more goal, you set the rate to zero for the time period you&#8217;ll be on vacation.
Do-less goals don&#8217;t work like that.
The best way to take a break on a do-less goal is to turn off the PPRs before you leave, and then&#8230; let it sit.
When you come back,
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/ratchet/\\"
    title=\\"Road Ratchet Revamp Redresses “Ratcheting Breaks Breaks” Bug -- this post, great as it is, might be a bit much if you just want to know what ratcheting is. You could consult our FAQ or our glossary for that.\\"
  >
    ratchet
  </a>
  your safety buffer away and turn the PPRs back on to get back on track.
With a do-less zero goal, you won&#8217;t have built up any safety buffer, of course &#8212; but it might be too easy to forget about ticking that PPR box on again&#8230;
Do-more goals, with their strictly defined (and visible!) break boundaries, don&#8217;t have this problem.
The goal always works the same way, and you don&#8217;t have to juggle your settings twice to schedule one weekend trip.
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    (Another update from the future:
There&#8217;s now another approach to breaks on do-less goals if you&#8217;re willing to use the 
road editor.
Namely, insert a vertical segment at the start of your break, the height of which you math out to be the sum of the PPRs that will accumulate during your break.)
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  (end ranting)
</p>
<h2>
  The Do-More Solution
</h2>
<p>
  A do-never using a do-more means 7 days per week.
Just create a do-more goal to
  <em>
    not
  </em>
  open the candy drawer with a rate of 7 per week.
Every day you don&#8217;t open the candy drawer, you enter a 1.
Every day will be a beemergency day, and Beeminder will send you reminders at the time of your choosing.
Set the reminders to start at 2:30pm, right about when you start getting bored and wandering over to the candy drawer!
Everything is simpler!
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    (One more note from the future to remind you that picking when your reminders start is now equally simple in the do-more and do-less version, but reminders in general do still work better for do-more goals than for do-less goals.
We&#8217;re working on that!)
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  You&#8217;re still not eating candy, you have to enter your data every day, everything you&#8217;re achieving is the same, but Beeminder is better at reminding you this way, and you&#8217;re more likely to achieve your candy goal.
</p>
<h2>
  When to Do-Less
</h2>
<p>
  As always, I caveat everything I just said
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"CAVEAT1\\"
    href=\\"#CAVEAT\\"
  >
    [5]
  </a>
  by reminding you this is all my opinion, heavily biased by undoing many derailments and explaining this (in fewer words) many times over the years. 
I fully admit that I wrote this post so that I could send it to people in support replies and stop reinventing the wheel.
</p>
<p>
  Do-less goals aren&#8217;t all bad &#8212; it&#8217;s just this
  <em>
    one
  </em>
  particular use case that Beeminder does not handle as smartly as the rest.
Do-less goals are great when you actually want to do
  <em>
    less
  </em>
  of something: 
cutting your coffee intake from 2 cups a day to 1, 
limiting yourself to 15 minutes a day on Twitter, 
ensuring that you don&#8217;t spend more than $100/month on work lunches.
If that&#8217;s your goal, do-less away!
But if you&#8217;re really trying to do
  <em>
    never
  </em>
  , try starting a do-more instead.

  Really, you could use any goal type to do it, if you&#8217;re a serious Beeminder junkie/hacker.

  Tomorrow is the beginning of November, which kicks off National Novel Writing Month. 
Last year we put together some tools for NaNoWriMo and blogged about it:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/nanowrimo/\\">
      Beemind Your NaNoWriMo Progress
    </a>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  This year we have some new tools to support beeminding writers.
The biggie that we&#8217;re really excited about is
  <a
    href=\\"http://beeminder.com/draft\\"
    title=\\"Obscure fun fact: The founder of Draft, Nate Kontny, was previously a cofounder of a prediction markets startup, Inkling Markets\\"
  >
    Integration with Draft
  </a>
  .
Mostly because we are really excited about Draft and how well it is done!
It&#8217;s a pretty brilliant editor for writers that makes it much nicer to selectively accept edits on your drafts, among other things.
</p>
<p>
  NaNoWriMo is all about churning out 50,000 words, with little thought to editing.
With our
  <a
    href=\\"http://draftin.com\\"
    title=\\"I think of Draft as version control for writers with no nerdery required\\"
  >
    Draft
  </a>
  integration the focus is on editing:
The commitment is not just to add words but to hone your document.
The metric we use for that is words added
  <em>
    plus
  </em>
  words deleted.
Beeminding wordcount incentivizes you to keep braindumping text into your document without necessarily ever getting closer to a finished product.
We&#8217;ve seen this happen!
</p>
<h2>
  For the serious NaNoWriMo nerds
</h2>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;Beeminding wordcount incentivizes you to keep braindumping text&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  Of course, NaNoWriMo is about exactly that, braindumping as much text as possible into your document.
So we think of our Draft integration as the solution to your prosaic motivation problems the other eleven months of the year.
Also, we mind everything across all of your Drafts &#8212; so probably not what you want for minding progress on a specific document.
If you do want to use Draft for your NaNoWriMo goal this year, you can dust off last year&#8217;s wordcount integration.
Give us the public url to your Draft document and we will plot the wordcount for you.
You can find the public url by copying the share link.
Then fire up
  <a href=\\"http://beeminder.com/nanowrimo\\">
    beeminder.com/nanowrimo
  </a>
  and start a Public URL goal.
Before you submit, though, you need to add &#8220;.txt&#8221; after the document ID, and before the &#8220;?token=&#8221; portion of the URL (to give us the plain text version). 
So if your url looked like:
</p>
<pre>
  <code>
    &quot;draftin.com/documents/123456?token=...&quot;
  </code>
</pre>
<p>
  You&#8217;d change it like so:
</p>
<pre>
  <code>
    &quot;draftin.com/documents/123456.txt?token=....&quot;
  </code>
</pre>
<p>
  If you&#8217;re editing your novel in another public place, like in a Google doc, or an Etherpad, or if you save your document in your Dropbox and can find a plain text public URL to that then those will work as well.
It&#8217;s just got to be a publicly accessible URL, and it has to be plain text (if we try to do a wordcount on a Word doc or a PDF or something, it will come out all wrong).
Note that &#8220;publicly accessible&#8221; doesn&#8217;t have to mean &#8220;public&#8221;.
Google docs, for example, will give you an essentially private link for sharing with &#8220;anyone with this URL&#8221;.
</p>
<h2>
  For the super nerds
</h2>
<p>
  Thanks to our own Andy Brett, we have a fully open source app for beeminding raw total wordcount of any set of publicly accessible URLs. 
It&#8217;s both useful for Nanowrimo and a great example app for beeminding any crazy thing you can imagine using our API.

  Here&#8217;s the bottom line on weight loss: unless more calories are being used than consumed, no weight loss will happen. There&#8217;s no magic.
There is plenty of confusion and struggle, however.
Simply eating less backfires and it&#8217;s because of hormones.
Your body really doesn&#8217;t want your weight to change.
Oh, you&#8217;re eating less? Ok, we&#8217;ll just slow everything down to make sure you don&#8217;t waste away!
To win you need to maintain a high metabolism.
You have Calories In on one side of the equation and you have Calories Out on the other, but Calories Out comprises your total burn rate, not just how many minutes you stayed on the treadmill.
Increase that total burn rate, i.e., your metabolism, and you&#8217;ll get way farther ahead.
Here are six key actions to take to lose weight.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      EAT REAL FOOD!
Real food is what grows in the ground or
      <a
        href=\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soylent_Green\\"
        title=\\"Spoiler alert\\"
      >
        has a mother
      </a>
      .
Does this mean never eat a potato chip, cookie, or cake again?
Of course not, you&#8217;re allowed treats.
But the majority of the time, eat REAL FOOD!
Your body thrives on real food.
You&#8217;ll feel satisfied from the nutrients, it will minimize cravings and you&#8217;ll naturally find your weight doing what it should do.
You won&#8217;t last in weight loss by simply eating less of the crap.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      EAT PROTEIN!
Be sure to get protein every time you eat.
Healthy fats (olive oil, nuts) and proteins (peanut butter, nuts, lean meats, eggs, beans, dairy products) keep you satiated longer and enter the blood stream at a much slower rate.
This means you use up the energy (calories) as you need it rather than having it broken down and into the blood stream right away.
Which is what happens when you eat something that&#8217;s all carbs.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      EAT FREQUENTLY!
Eat 4-5 mini meals a day, about three hours apart.
Long periods of time without eating cause hormones to slow down metabolism and majorly increase the chances you&#8217;ll be ravenous and eat more.
And don&#8217;t eat within a few hours of going to bed.
Your body&#8217;s not ready to use calories then.
It&#8217;s winding down and you&#8217;ll only store them as fat.
(UPDATE 2014: 
We&#8217;re not so sure about this anymore!
It may technically be true about hormones and whatnot but it&#8217;s a second-order effect.
The first-order effect is simply how much you&#8217;re eating.
So any meal you skip or delay, that&#8217;s overall a win for weight loss!)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      EAT ENOUGH, but not too much!
Metabolism will respond negatively to undereating.
Eat to satisfaction and when you feel hunger again, eat to satisfaction again.
Think of a scale from 1 to 10 where 1 is starving and 10 is really uncomfortably full.
If you tune in to true hunger feelings (stop and assess before just grabbing something!) and try to eat when you&#8217;re at a 3 (first physical feeling of hunger) and eat until you hit 7 or 8 (satisfied/content), you&#8217;ll stay in the right range for maximum metabolism and you&#8217;ll find you have to eat every three hours to stay in that range.
(UPDATE 2014: See update to #3.)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      EAT VEGGIES!
Having trouble with #4 above? Then eat more vegetables (the green, the leafy, the carrot &#8212; this is not a call to eat all the potato you want). 
Think of them like packing peanuts for your stomach.
The more veggies you eat, the less room for other stuff.
If you struggle with getting enough veggies, try heating up frozen veggies with dinner and lunch. 
Serve yourself tons of veggies and eat them first; you&#8217;ll be satisfied without getting seconds of the other stuff.
Finally, don&#8217;t fret about putting olive oil on them, or salt (it&#8217;ll be less than the amount of sodium you&#8217;d get from the canned equivalent, for one).
The fullness to calorie ratio in the veggies will more than compensate for the calories in the olive oil and the heart healthy fats are good for you.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      MOVE!
The more intensity, even in small bits, the higher your metabolism will be.
(Higher metabolism means more calories that you&#8217;ll burn during
      <em>
        and after
      </em>
      the workouts.)
Completely turned off by intense workouts?
Take walks, play, clean the house, etc.
Do anything that gets you moving because any extra calories burned will help.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Whatever you do, don&#8217;t feel overwhelmed by the information here!
Take one call-to-action away with you and work on it for a while.
 
Don&#8217;t expect to change multiple habits at once.
Take one tip and experiment with incorporating it into your life.
Come back later and try another.
Also, take it day by day, thinking about what you can do to go in the right direction today.
Worry about tomorrow tomorrow.

  </a>
  fantasizing about how I will turn into a better person when the calendar turns into 2017.
And since I am here writing this on the Beeminder blog, you might not be surprised to learn that I&#8217;ve been thinking about what new Beeminder goals I should start up.
</p>
<h2>
  Improve All The Things!
</h2>
<p>
  My first instinct is, of course, to create hardcore, no-mercy goals to fix everything I wish I was better about.
Do 60 minutes of HIIT cardio every morning!
Eat three homecooked meals a day &#8212; and nothing else!
Read one current NYT bestseller every week!
Send a percentage of every paycheck to charity!
All starting January 1st&#8230; or maybe January 2nd.
(I find Mondays are more inspiring for self-overhauls, don&#8217;t you?)
</p>
<p>
  The problem is, of course, I tried this last year.
And it all crashed and burned around&#8230; January 4th.
It turns out the reason I don&#8217;t do all those things already is because
  <em>
    they&#8217;re hard for me to do.
  </em>
  As soon as I slip up on any of my hardcore goals, the goal of perfection is no longer attainable, and a house-of-cards-style collapse soon follows on the rest.
</p>
<p>
  Is this irrational?
Of course.
Have I done it billions
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"NOT1\\"
    href=\\"#NOT\\"
  >
    [2]
  </a>
  of times in my life anyway?
You betcha!
So my first resolution for 2017 will be to
  <em>
    not
  </em>
  make sweeping grandiose resolutions in 2017.
Feeling pretty good about this one, you guys.
</p>
<p>
  (Now, someone is definitely reading this saying, &#8220;the hardcore approach worked just fine for
  <em>
    me
  </em>
  !&#8221;
Not denying it!
People are different, and goals are different.
I&#8217;ve succeeded at some of those cold-turkey goals too.
But they aren&#8217;t a magic bullet for me, and one day, you might find a goal you struggle with too!)
</p>
<h2>
  Looking Back on 2016
</h2>
<p>
  2016 wasn&#8217;t a super-duper productive year for me.
I didn&#8217;t set or achieve any fun interesting goals worth mentioning in this blog post.
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"FUN1\\"
    href=\\"#FUN\\"
  >
    [3]
  </a>
  (This sounds depressing.
I swear I&#8217;m not depressed.)
But I was using Beeminder the whole time regardless, and looking back on it, I&#8217;ve actually had success with some pretty boring goals!
</p>
<p>
  Case Study 1: 
Cleaning my bathroom.
</p>
<p>
  <a href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/chelsea/tublet\\">
    <img
      src=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/chelsea/tublet.png\\"
      alt=\\"Graph of Chelsea's tub-scrubbing progress\\"
      title=\\"Chelsea's tub-scrubbing goal\\"
      class=\\"aligncenter\\"
    >
  </a>
</p>
<p>
  This is quite possibly the most boring Beeminder goal out there, and I&#8217;ve seen a whole lot of Beeminder goals.
I made it back at the beginning of summer, and I haven&#8217;t derailed on it once.
When that emergency day rolls around, I&#8217;m always slightly annoyed, but not annoyed enough to pay the $5 for the privilege of not scrubbing my tub for five minutes.
And it&#8217;s never that dirty anyway, since I&#8217;m cleaning it once a month.
I started this goal on a whim, and it turns out I feel weirdly great about myself for being so conscientious about my bathroom cleaning!
I recently took this inspiration into the
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/chelsea/cleansink\\"
    title=\\"Chelsea&#39;s sink-emptying goal\\"
  >
    kitchen
  </a>
  to break a bad habit in there: leaving dishes to &#8220;soak&#8221;&#8230; for days at a time.
No more!
</p>
<p>
  Case Study 2: 
Stepping on the scale.
</p>
<p>

<p>
  <em>
    Not
  </em>
  beeminding weight &#8212; just beeminding
  <em>
    recording my weight
  </em>
  every day I&#8217;m at home.
I&#8217;ve got a Beeminder weight goal too, but it&#8217;s got a flat road and a $0 pledge, so I&#8217;m at no risk of paying up.
This didn&#8217;t inspire me to lose much weight, but it did prevent a god-awful &#8220;surprise! you&#8217;ve gained 10 pounds since you last stepped on this dusty, abandoned scale 4 months ago&#8221; moment.
A year&#8217;s history of weigh-ins automatically recorded in both Fitbit &amp; Beeminder and not wasting a $100 scale purchase &#8212; I&#8217;m counting this as a 2016 win!
</p>
<p>
  Case Study 3: 
Stocking my savings.
</p>
<p>
  <a href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/chelsea/savings\\">
    <img
      src=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/chelsea/savings.png\\"

      title=\\"Chelsea's savings goal\\"
      class=\\"aligncenter\\"
    >
  </a>
</p>
<p>
  I set a pretty ambitious savings goal this year, more as a personal challenge than anything else, and I hit it!
Turns out I&#8217;ll procrastinate forever on this type of thing without automatic deposits, so I&#8217;ll be keeping those enabled for the foreseeable future.
Now I&#8217;ve got a nice stash of cash to
  <s>
    blow on Beeminder derailments in 2017
  </s>
  give me a bit of Real Life Safety Buffer

</p>
<h2>
  Looking Forward to 2017
</h2>
<p>
  My accidental successes of 2016 were all easy things.
I almost feel silly for counting them as successes, because they weren&#8217;t that difficult for me to accomplish.
For 2017, I&#8217;m going to keep on with that learning and beemind more
  <em>
    easy
  </em>
  things.
</p>
<p>
  Instead of spending hours drawing up an elaborately planned zero-waste menu for the entire month of January, I&#8217;ll commit to try out 2 new recipes a week.
Instead of researching and choosing the best 8-Week Fat-Busting Muscle Burn Tone Firm Plan System to follow, I&#8217;ll commit to go on a 30-minute daily walk.
If these easy things become enjoyable habits, I can up the ante by dialing my road to a higher rate.
Or maybe I can add a goal to go on a weekly run in addition to my daily walks.
Who knows?
Whatever feels easy.
</p>
<p>
  Starting a goal that you don&#8217;t actually think you can achieve is a baaaad idea, for a number of reasons.
There&#8217;s appropriately challenging, and then there&#8217;s unrealistic.
(I wrote about this a little
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/chelsea/\\"
    title=\\"Pro tips for returning from weaselville\\"
  >
    before
  </a>
  &#8212; see #2!)
</p>
<p>
  This year, I&#8217;m going to try to tone down my enthusiasm a bit.
Creating easy goals that I feel good about sounds like a more promising road to success than expecting one day to inspire a total 180&deg; in multiple habits and areas of my life.
By beeminding easy things, I might finally achieve some of the hard goals I&#8217;ve never managed to conquer before.
</p>
<p>
  I mean, this time I wrote a public blog post about it.
So like, I really can&#8217;t fail now.
That&#8217;d be so embarrassing.

    src=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/egg-basket-bee.png\\"

</p>
<p>
  The startup egg-basket principle is: put all your eggs in one basket. 
Be laser-focused on the one thing you&#8217;re best at.
If you&#8217;re scrambling for survival, focus only on the one most promising thing for making the startup sustainable.
For example, most startups should focus exclusively on their premium plans and not have a free plan.
So much complexity and extra work is added by having to deal with the distinct kinds of users that try a free plan compared to the ones who are ready to pony up on day one, not to mention all the code you need to handle the transition from free to paid.
</p>
<p>
  It took us a long time to get the egg-basket principle through our heads and we had one near-death experience from violating it.
Namely the
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/beekeeper\\"
    title=\\"Original blog post announcing it\\"
  >
    Beekeeper program
  </a>
  .
It was so tempting, when a user told us they&#8217;d happily pay a couple hundred dollars a month for more hand-holding and accountability, to take them up on that.
So tempting that we actually did it, and hired someone to run what amounted to a lifecoaching subsidiary of Beeminder.
The numbers seemed so persuasive but of course we massively underestimated the time and attention and energy it would take.
And thus Beekeeper almost killed Beeminder but fortunately we killed it first.
</p>
<p>
  (There&#8217;s now a brilliant startup that focuses just on personal hand-holding and accountability &#8212;
  <a
    href=\\"http://bossasaservice.life\\"
    title=\\"Also we&#39;re now friends with the founder and can thoroughly vouch for this company\\"
  >
    Boss as a Service
  </a>
  &#8212; which we highly recommend and which complements Beeminder beautifully.)
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;&#8230; never introduce premium plans to Beeminder&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  Here&#8217;s a more controversial example.
If
  <em>
    very hypothetically
  </em>
  we had a time machine it probably would&#8217;ve been prudent to never introduce premium plans to Beeminder.
It was a form of diversification from our existing monetization strategy &#8212; exactly what startups should never do. 
Again, that&#8217;s hypothetical.
We&#8217;re not planning to kill premium plans.
But the amount of time and effort and confusion that premium plans have caused has plausibly exceeded the revenue they’ve brought in, especially if you count the additional revenue we could’ve created with all those hours of our lives.
</p>
<p>
  (It&#8217;s also true that we made it all way more complicated than we needed to with
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/autocancel\\"
    title=\\"NB: also auto-resuming!\\"
  >
    auto-canceling
  </a>
  and half a calculus book&#8217;s worth of math in the
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/fair\\"
    title=\\"Exquisite fairness!\\"
  >
    discount slider
  </a>
  , 
but those are very much the tip of the iceberg in terms of aggregate confusion for us and users, UI complexity, bugs, etc, compared to the universe where there just was no such thing as premium.)
</p>
<p>
  If we ever wanted to actually consider scuttling premium plans it would be a pretty huge amount of work, even just deciding for sure that it was a good idea in theory, let alone in practice, with making things fair for people. 
E.g., what&#8217;s the value of being able to say we have a charity option, 
how much do we save in support costs by paywalling confusing features, etc, etc.
</p>
<p>
  Of course the daunting difficulty of walking back something like this is all the more argument against doing it in the first place.
You have to be really sure it&#8217;s worth it, and if it&#8217;s diverting your attention from the one thing you&#8217;re best at, the thing providing the core value of your product, then it&#8217;s likely not worth it.

<p>
  I&#8217;m trying not to gloat too much but I&#8217;ve been pooh-poohing Ego Depletion for years.
My take has been, based on the theory of hyperbolic discounting, that willpower is an illusion &#8212; a manifestation of the conflict between desires at different timescales.
Which is why commitment devices, by changing your incentives, route around the problem entirely.

And hooray for economist Robert Strotz and psychologist George Ainslie who figured this all out between 1955 and 1975 or so.

  Actually I really can&#8217;t gloat too much because I was far from the first to balk at Baumeister&#8217;s model.
In fact, it wasn&#8217;t until

but did agree with the premise that mental willpower is depletable like physical willpower is.
With the right inducement you may be able to eke out another mile of running or another hour of studying but in both cases the fatigue is real.
</p>
<p>
  My counterargument is that with physical endurance you approach a physical limit asymptotically. 
The feeling that you can always eke out more with the right inducement is an illusion. 
Eventually one more straw will in fact break a camel&#8217;s back. 
With mental willpower it&#8217;s different.
With the right inducement (say, continued employment) you can exert superhuman willpower, like waking up early and going to work every day for years or decades. 
Which is to say that with the right incentives, willpower doesn&#8217;t even need to be invoked. 
You can route around it and find creative ways to induce yourself to do what you really want to do.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;With the right inducement you can exert superhuman mental willpower.&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  Since I&#8217;ve now segued elegantly back to Beeminder, the best way to use such a commitment device, at least initially, is not to probe the hard limits of willpower but to fix egregious instances of akrasia &#8212; to do a bit more than the bupkes you&#8217;d do if left to your own devices. 
You can then gradually dial up the steepness of your graph, but stop before feeling overwhelmed by stress and anxiety.
</p>
<p>
  In other words, make a measurable improvement well below the point that the limits of willpower are even a question (if you don’t think of it as routing around willpower altogether). 
Some people &#8212; like the productivity-ueber-alles types who try polyphasic sleep and whatnot &#8212; thrive on adding stress and Beeminder can accommodate that. 
But using it in moderation can reduce stress and that depleted ego feeling, like by getting you to spread your studying out over a semester instead of cramming for exams, or by making you pay attention to your Fitbit just enough to get in 10k steps a day, or getting yourself to bed on time instead of staying up until 6am writing a blog post.

<h3>
  Beeminder Reprise
</h3>
<p>
  You&#8217;re probably here because you either know and love Beeminder, or you&#8217;re using an Epson Runsense or Pulsense device. 
Since this is Beeminder turf we&#8217;ll start with a quick explanation of what Beeminder&#8217;s all about. 
(For the full Beeminder story, you could start with
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/akrasia\\"
    title=\\"&#39;How To Do What You Want: Akrasia and Self-Binding&#39;\\"
  >
    our inaugural blog post
  </a>
  about akrasia and self-binding, a.k.a. commitment devices.)
</p>
<p>
  What&#8217;s special about Beeminder is that we combine Quantified Self &#8212; of which Runsense and Pulsense are exemplary &#8212; with commitment contracts.
If you don&#8217;t know anything about commitment devices, it works like this with Beeminder:
We plot your progress along a Yellow Brick Road to your goal and if you go off track, we charge you money.
Long-time Beeminder users find that those stings (get it?) are well worth it for all the awesomeness we induce the rest of the time.
But if the thought of having to pay money is too scary, that&#8217;s perfect: you&#8217;ll be very motivated to keep all your datapoints on your yellow brick road.
We don&#8217;t even ask for a credit card until the first time you go off track.
If you never do go off track, Beeminder is free forever.
</p>
<h3>
  Runsense and Pulsense
</h3>
<p>
  If you&#8217;re a Quantified Self nerd, which, reading this blog you probably are, then here&#8217;s what you&#8217;ll want to know about Epson&#8217;s new devices.
There&#8217;s one Runsense device, the round-faced watch in the title image, and it uses both GPS and an accelerometer to measure your pace and distance for running.
We&#8217;ve used an early demo version a bunch and it&#8217;s great.
The battery lasts many days if you use it as a watch and lasts pretty much all day with the GPS on.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;(Bee)mind steps or time asleep for Pulsense, and distance or time run for Runsense&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  There are two Pulsense devices and both track your heartrate (with no chest strap &#8212; just from your wrist!) as well as steps.
In our experience the continuous heartrate monitoring is very impressive, more accurate than an early version of

<h3>
  Beeminding Fitness
</h3>
<p>
  Beeminder helps you keep on track with your training and makes sure that you&#8217;ll still be using it in a month&#8217;s time.
With Pulsense, you can measure the number of steps, so you can make sure you&#8217;re keeping active and walking, say, ten thousand steps every day (on average).
With Runsense you can track time and distance spent running.
You can create Beeminder goals for any of these, giving you extra motivation:
a commitment that you&#8217;ll stick to, complete with graphs of your progress which will show you, for example, how far you&#8217;ve run and how far you need to run again today to keep up with your goal.

  My mom recently lost $5,000 to my brother in a commitment contract gone wild.
That was started in part as an experiment early in Beeminder&#8217;s beta period before we&#8217;d thought of things like the exponential pledge schedule. 
Believe it or not, it was actually a pretty positive outcome: 
my mom gradually lost a tiny bit of weight (more importantly: didn&#8217;t gain weight!) for over 2 years, thus paying my brother on average $179/month for that fitness program. 
Not very cost efficient, but quite

  </a>
  !
</p>
<p>
  I&#8217;m sure not many people are keen to emulate that experiment with my mom and brother, but it really hit home for me how valuable Beeminder&#8217;s exponential pledge schedule is. 
With that $5k contract it was a lot of stress to decide on such a high amount and make sure there was no inadvertently toxic fine print (even amongst family!) and to actually take the plunge and have the contract officially start.
</p>
<p>
  The way it works in the current Beeminder is just infinitely better. 
By the time you hit motivating amounts of money all the doubts, fears, and uncertainties have been quelled. 
Beeminder has earned something for its trouble and you&#8217;ve got yourself nicely self-bound with quantified confidence that you can stay on track from now on, perhaps with a

    tweak of the road dial
  </a>
  .
</p>
<p>
  If that new crazy amount keeps you on track for years (like it did for my mom) then maybe eventually it will lose its sting (like it did for my mom). 
Well, if so, we hope you&#8217;ll feel like Beeminder earned its money by then.
And the next even crazier pledge level should motivate you for even longer.

<p>
  There&#8217;s another reason we&#8217;re so pleased with ourselves for coming up with the exponential pledge schedule:
It&#8217;s how we make all our money (currently about midway between ramen profitability and day-job equivalency).
We get you hooked when it&#8217;s free and then charge you more in

  to how valuable you find us, as demonstrated by the severity of the kick in the pants it takes to keep you on track.
Before we figured all this out, we used to get dollar signs in our eyes when gung ho users wanted to jump to commitment contracts with hundreds or thousands of dollars at risk.
Eventually we learned that there&#8217;s approximately no chance that people will derail with that kind of money at stake the first time.

  That&#8217;s especially true given how generous we are about what counts as a legitimate derailment.
We pretty much only make you pay if the derailment was due to akrasia.
[UPDATE from the far future (2021): We don&#8217;t
  <em>

  endorse that statement these days. 
Commitment contracts should have nice bright lines and things can get pretty weaselly if you contest any derailment for which you have any excuse.]

  <strong>
    UPDATE 2017:
This whole post is of historical interest only.
We have gotten rid of exponential roads in Beeminder!
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  Once in a while someone tries to set up a yellow brick road where the steepness automatically increases by, say, 10% each week. 
It seems like a so-called exponential road (available with custom goals, which is one of the
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/premium/#beelite\\"
    title=\\"It costs $5/month currently ... or $51/year ... or $169 for a lifetime subscription\\"
  >
    Bee Lite premium
  </a>
  perks) might be just the ticket.
</p>
<p>
  But exponential roads can&#8217;t be used that way. 
They can be used for weight loss, for example, when you want the daily or weekly decrease to be a function of your current weight
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"CURRENT1\\"
    href=\\"#CURRENT\\"
  >
    [1]
  </a>
  (we recommend a max loss rate of 1% of your weight per week). 
But we don&#8217;t have a way to make the rate depend on what the previous
  <em>
    rate
  </em>
  was. 
I think the confusion here stems from the fact that Beeminder is plotting the cumulative total on the y-axis. 
Having the rate depend on that cumulative total doesn&#8217;t make sense.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;That&#8217;s not as onerous as it sounds and you&#8217;ll want to reassess the steepness of your road weekly anyway.&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  What we recommend is that you just manually nudge the rate every week with the

    title=\\"If you&#39;re too lazy to click this link (and it&#39;s a link to the Beeminder glossary so we don&#39;t blame you) here&#39;s the short version: the road dial refers to the three fields under your graph that let you adjust the steepness of your yellow brick road, with a one-week delay, by specifying one of three of {end date, end value, rate}.\\"

  </a>
  . 
We think you&#8217;ll find that&#8217;s not as onerous as it sounds and that you&#8217;ll want to reassess the steepness of your road weekly anyway.
Again, you don&#8217;t actually want exponential goals unless the rate depends on the current value being plotted on the y-axis. 
Which doesn&#8217;t make sense when the cumulative total is what&#8217;s being plotted.
</p>
<p>
  Something like &#8220;losing 0.3% of your bodyweight per week&#8221; (much more realistic than the ultra hardcore 1%/week, btw) is where it does make sense. 
Or like our

    meta graphs
  </a>
  where we want to grow at some percentage per week.
</p>
<p>
  The point is, if you&#8217;re excited about tweaking the heck out of your yellow brick roads then, first of all, we&#8217;re always excited to hear about what

  Technically it&#8217;s a function of where your road is, but if you&#8217;re using the yellow brick road as a guide (like most folks), then that&#8217;s roughly the same thing.
If you&#8217;re way ahead of schedule, it won&#8217;t be the same thing, but through the beauty of exponential curves, it soon will be!

  One of our most intrepid users (but anonymous and unlinkable, sorry) has written herself a script that adjusts the road slope nightly, based on her actual progress on the goal.
It&#8217;s not exponential (though you can pick the algorithm) but it does keep her slopes increasing automagically over time.
(Watch out for holidays, deliberate slowdowns, and archived goals, if you automate something like this!)
We&#8217;ll hopefully convince her to share it at some point because that and the other stuff she&#8217;s hacked up &#8212;

<p>
  Beeminder is very good at keeping you on the wagon but it&#8217;s still possible to fall off.
When that happens, why does it?
We&#8217;ve asked people that a lot over the years and thought we&#8217;d collect the reasons.
</p>
<h3>
  1. Bugs or other technical issues with Beeminder
</h3>
<p>
  From our perspective, there are still plenty of bugs and technical issues with Beeminder but this seems to be gratifyingly rare as a reason people have for leaving Beeminder.
Not that we&#8217;re getting an unbiased sample when we ask this.
In any case, we&#8217;re constantly fixing bugs and improving the robustness of fetching data from our integration partners and generally making Beeminder ever more reliable.
As you can see from our now staggeringly large
  <a
    href=\\"https://beeminder.com/changelog\\"
    title=\\"AKA our list of User-Visible Improvements (UVIs)\\"
  >
    changelog
  </a>
  .
</p>
<h3>
  2. Friction of beeminding turns out to be too high
</h3>
<p>
  Hopefully we&#8217;re mitigating this by adding more and more autodata integrations.
If you&#8217;re beeminding a metric from a gadget or service we integrate with 
(see the gallery on our
  <a
    href=\\"https://beeminder.com/home\\"
    title=\\"We have dozens of autodata integrations and we&#39;re committed (literally) to keep adding more\\"
  >
    front page
  </a>
  )
then there&#8217;s kind of literally no friction.
You just wear your Fitbit or do your Duolingo or read Pocket articles or whatever else you&#8217;re already doing and Beeminder yells at you if you&#8217;re not doing enough.
</p>
<p>
  If you need to beemind something we don&#8217;t integrate with and need to enter your data manually, well, we try hard to make that as easy as possible. 
(The latest is Apple Shortcuts integration making it easy to add data with one tap on an iPhone.) 
But just thinking to do that is friction, of course.
We hope the graph makes it worth it, or the dopamine hit from logging those +1&#8217;s, but that doesn&#8217;t work for everyone.
</p>
<h3>
  3. Weaselliness creeps in
</h3>
<p>
  This is also much less likely to be a problem with an automatic data source.
And we have a lot of advice for

  around it.
When it happens, users have told us the root cause is having chosen a bad goal or a bad metric.
Which brings us to the next reason.
</p>
<h3>
  4. Genuine change of mind about one&#8217;s goal
</h3>
<p>
  Like it turns out dieting sucks too much and just isn&#8217;t worth it.
Ironically this is something users often whole-heartedly praise us for.
Beeminder can make crystal clear how much you actually value a goal you thought you had and that you previously just made yourself feel guilty about not sticking to.
Getting that clarity and letting a goal go can be worth a lot, users tell us.
</p>
<h3>
  5. Failing to find a way to measure or quantify one&#8217;s most important goals
</h3>
<p>
  This is definitely a dealbreaker when it happens.
We do think there&#8217;s almost always a way to find some
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/box/\\"
    title=\\"See the section on Proxy Beeminding\\"

  that may not be exactly your underlying goal but that moves you in the right direction nonetheless.

Don&#8217;t you run into Goodhart&#8217;s Law, you ask?
Where a metric used as a target ceases to be a good metric.
Great question, but

<h3>
  6. Burning out
</h3>
<p>
  This is another biggie and we have

    title=\\"Beating Beeminder Burnout\\"

    suggestions
  </a>

Mainly starting slow.
Beeminder is powerful stuff.
Don&#8217;t let the power go to your head!
Beeminder is a long-term solution and it&#8217;s really important to use it sustainably.
</p>
<h3>
  7. Succeeding at one&#8217;s goal or successfully establishing a habit
</h3>
<p>
  I guess this one doesn&#8217;t count as falling off the wagon.
We do it hear it sometimes, but it&#8217;s relatively rare to have a Beeminder goal with a fixed end date (and to have no other goals afterward!).
Generally it&#8217;s things like &#8220;average 10k steps per day, forever&#8221; or &#8220;play a song a day on the guitar until music dies&#8221;.
And once you have a graph of your progress, people tend to want to keep that graph going indefinitely, even if they&#8217;ve cultivated a habit and don&#8217;t need additional motivation from Beeminder anymore.
Or just that Beeminder is part of that habit.
(Does that mean Beeminder is a crutch?
Of course

  Addendum
</h1>
<p>
  Thanks to replies from the daily beemail subscribers, here are a few more, to round this out to a top-ten list:
</p>
<h3>
  8. Reactance

  >
    psychological phenomenon
  </a>
  where you feel a compulsion to rebel or are otherwise demotivated by consequences.
Apparently some people discover they suffer from this and I can see how that could be a dealbreaker for using Beeminder.
</p>
<h3>
  9. Self-delusion
</h3>
<p>
  Sometimes folks aren&#8217;t able to reconcile what they want and what they&#8217;re willing to do for it and prefer to stay self-deluded.

  >
    Want-Can-Will test
  </a>
  which we recommend you consider every time you add a Beeminder goal. 
If everything you beemind passes that test, that&#8217;s good insurance against falling off the wagon.
</p>
<h3>
  10. Life throws you a curveball
</h3>
<p>
  I don&#8217;t doubt this last one but it actually doesn&#8217;t make sense to me. 
In theory you&#8217;d schedule long flat spots on everything with

    title=\\"Blog post introducing the megabreak feature\\"

  </a>
  &#8212; perhaps after a slew of derailments if the curveball came out of left field, so to speak. 
But then you&#8217;d recover and the flat spots would end and you&#8217;d be back in business without ever having fallen off the wagon, right? 
I know I&#8217;m oversimplifying.

  You know how a lot of services offer things like one month free if you pay yearly?
We were nerding out over the math of that and thought, why not generalize to compute the perfectly fair discount for paying at any frequency you like, including every infinity years, i.e., paying once for a lifetime subscription?
Just pick a discount rate and do the net present value calculation to get the amount to charge at your chosen frequency so that it&#8217;s equivalent to paying monthly.
Before we lose all but the hardest core math and finance nerds, just try it. There&#8217;s a nifty slider!

  [UPDATE: We made lifetime plans more of a special case &#8212; they use a ~1% monthly discount rate instead of 3% monthly discount rate. We&#8217;ve intentionally made them more expensive because they&#8217;re more expensive for us to maintain.]
</p>
<p>
  [FURTHER UPDATE: We&#8217;ve
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/deathtolife/\\"
    title=\\"Not rescinding existing ones, obviously\\"
  >
    stopped selling lifetime plans
  </a>
  which is kind of a shame mathematically but extremely correct businessally.]
</p>
<p>
  To compute the discount we&#8217;re going with a 3% monthly (36% annualized) discount rate.
If you work out the discount rate such that &#8220;one month free if you pay yearly&#8221; is fair, it&#8217;s 19% annualized.

    class=\\"footnote\\"

  We decided to go higher in part because we expect higher attrition with our unusually generous
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/autocancel\\">
    auto-canceling subscriptions
  </a>
  .
Trello, on the other hand, recently launched
  <a href=\\"http://blog.trello.com/introducing-business-class/\\">
    Trello Business Class
  </a>
  at $25/month or $200/year.
You&#8217;ll notice that \\\\(\\\\$25 \\\\times 12 = \\\\$300\\\\) so that&#8217;s quite a discount for paying yearly &#8212; equivalent to a 97% annualized discount rate.
</p>
<p>
  Of course you&#8217;re not really pricing the discount based on the time-value of money
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"INT1\\"
    href=\\"#INT\\"
  >
    [2]
  </a>
  but rather your expected churn rate.
We heard that 3% attrition per month was common so that&#8217;s the other reason we thought we&#8217;d start with that.
(Note the self-selection bias there though &#8212; those opting to pay for a year or more at a time are less likely to be the ones churning.)
</p>
<h2>
  The Math
</h2>
<p>
  If the nominal monthly fee is \\\\(\\\\$m\\\\) and we pick a monthly discount rate \\\\(r\\\\) (e.g., 2% = 24% annualized) and you want to pay every \\\\(n\\\\) months instead of every month then the perfectly fair amount to charge every \\\\(n\\\\) months (starting with right now, of course) is: 
$$m\\\\frac{\\\\exp(r)-\\\\exp(r-n\\\\cdot r)}{\\\\exp(r)-1}$$
</p>
<p>
  For the cost of a lifetime subscription, take the limit as \\\\(n\\\\) goes to infinity:
$$\\\\frac{m e^r}{e^r - 1}$$
</p>
<p>
  In finance-speak, that&#8217;s the net present value of the annuity of \\\\(n\\\\) monthly payments at the nominal monthly rate, \\\\(m\\\\).
For example, with \\\\(m=20\\\\), \\\\(r=.02\\\\), and \\\\(n=12\\\\) you get $215.51 as the yearly cost.
So that&#8217;s slightly better than &#8220;one month free if you pay yearly&#8221; &#8212; \\\\($20 \\\\times 11 = $220\\\\)
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"INF1\\"
    href=\\"#INF\\"
  >
    [3]
  </a>
  &#8212; which, as we noted, implies an annualized discount rate of 19%.
Setting \\\\(n=\\\\infty\\\\) yields $1010.03 so that would be the cost of a lifetime subscription, using those parameters. 
Picking 20 years (\\\\(n=240\\\\)) yields $1001.72 so you might as well go with a lifetime subscription well before that point.
</p>
<h2>
  Fair&#8217;s Fair
</h2>
<p>
  First, the point of getting a discount is that you&#8217;re pre-paying for a greater length of time, i.e., committing to subscribe for at least that long.
We&#8217;re happy to give refunds, no questions asked, if you&#8217;re not happy but we don&#8217;t automatically refund money you pre-paid if you stop using Beeminder.
Hopefully that&#8217;s not surprising when paired with our auto-canceling subscriptions.
The way we implement it is simply this:
Regardless of how frequently you&#8217;re paying, we look at your activity for the previous month when it&#8217;s time to charge you.
If you haven&#8217;t added any datapoints in that month, we suppress the charge.
We still check again next time, in case you come back.
</p>
<h2>
  Crazy Loopholes
</h2>
<p>
  Our simplistic way of implementing auto-canceling subscriptions &#8212; stop the charge if you weren&#8217;t active in the past month &#8212; does make for one unfortunate loophole when combined with the ability to choose your payment frequency:
You could, for example, pay for a yearly premium plan on January 1, use Beeminder until December 1, then stop for a month.
On January 1 of the following year you&#8217;ll be officially inactive and we won&#8217;t charge you.
You can then resume beeminding for another 11 months and rinse and repeat.
You&#8217;ll pay for one year but get a lifetime of use, minus Decembers.
We figured we&#8217;d just hand you that one on a silver platter on the theory that it takes the fun out of exploiting it and why else would anyone bother to exploit such a loophole than to prove that they could.
If it&#8217;s actually to save money then by all means, knock yourself out, and you&#8217;re very welcome.

    The nerdery actually goes a bit deeper.
You can&#8217;t just add up the monthly payments for the coming year and call that the non-discounted price.
You have to at least account for inflation when comparing the price of paying monthly to the price of paying less frequently.
In fact, if you want to compare the price of paying monthly to the price of a lifetime subscription it doesn&#8217;t even make sense if you just add up the monthly payments.
Paying a monthly cost forever is not infinitely expensive.
Instead we take inflation to be 2% per year and use that to compare against when quoting the discount you&#8217;re getting as you slide the slider.
Note that this matters very little unless the payments are years apart; in fact we really only bothered in order to be able to say something coherent as the discount you&#8217;re getting for paying for a lifetime subscription.
  </p>
  <p>
    But for completeness, here&#8217;s the formula for the effective discount if paying every \\\\(n\\\\) months instead of monthly, using a monthly discount rate \\\\(r\\\\) for the slider and real monthly discount rate \\\\(R\\\\) (e.g., use \\\\(R=.03/12\\\\) for 3% yearly &#8212; a bit more than inflation):
$$1-\\\\frac{\\\\left(\\\\exp(R)-1\\\\right) \\\\left(\\\\exp(n r)-1\\\\right) \\\\exp((n-1)(R-r))}{\\\\left(\\\\exp(r)-1\\\\right) \\\\left(\\\\exp(n R)-1\\\\right)}$$
  </p>
  <p>
    And the limit as \\\\(n\\\\) goes to infinity for the effective discount for going lifetime:
$$\\\\frac{1-\\\\exp(r-R)}{1-\\\\exp(r)}$$
  </p>

Duolingo is definitely not the best language learner, because it just teaches you random words and sentences. 
Although if you use it for a long time, the things Duolingo teaches you can sometimes be handy.
Your progress gets entered automatically from Duolingo to Beeminder which is nice.
I still use Duolingo to improve my German and get more fluent.
I wouldn&#8217;t do Duolingo without Beeminder, and I can prove it because I am usually rushing to do it right before my bedtime.
If it weren&#8217;t for Beeminder telling me that I would derail, I would just go to bed and forget about it.

<p>
  I use Beeminder to track screen time so I won&#8217;t become like Jimmy Jet and his television set.
</p>
<p>
  My friend Alice Tiffany and I saw each other this summer and we were talking about what games we had on our phones. 
I said &#8220;I have Crossy Road and Geometry Dash. And you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
  &#8220;My mom took all the games off my phone because I played them too much,&#8221; said Alice.
</p>
<p>
  &#8220;That is a great reason to use Beeminder!!&#8221; said me and my dad at the same time.
</p>
<p>
  &#8220;What&#8217;s Beeminder?&#8221; asked Alice.
</p>
<p>
  So me and my dad explained Beeminder to Alice&#8230;
</p>
<p>
  How I keep track of things on my screen time goal is via

My parents weren&#8217;t sure about it because it can be hard to remember to enter data, which it is. 
Sometimes it is fun to do my must-dos, because if I have been feeling sad lately or have had an unpleasant feeling, I will make my must-do something SILLY or ExCiTiNg!!!

I have finished seven of the sixteen books and everyone has to January or Febuary to finish all sixteen.

Those are the reading level of the sixteen books.

<p>
  This is going to sound funny but we&#8217;ve toyed with having a rule in the Beeminder community against even mentioning the concept of fake data.
Especially funny is that instead we&#8217;re doing the diametric opposite and blogging about it.
</p>
<p>
  Our goal here is to explain what we were thinking there and convince you
 
that the mere idea of fake data is almost literally horrifying.
We have a particular set of community norms to cultivate.
In particular we&#8217;re aiming for a norm where fake data is so gross that it goes without saying that no one would even consider it.
</p>
<p>
  We&#8217;re thinking of this in terms of norms because just hearing about fake data as something existing Beeminder users would even consider can literally ruin Beeminder&#8217;s efficacy for someone.
And the most amazing and impressive Beeminder users

  >
</p>
<p>
  I see that and I&#8217;m thinking, &#8220;oh, wow, I would not have guessed that that was possible or a thing people ever did.&#8221;
Now I know it is and they do!
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;All I want is to make fake data as much a taboo as incest and cannibalism. Is that too much to ask?&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  Or take the classic PSA about littering that
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232483471_A_Focus_Theory_of_Normative_Conduct_Recycling_the_Concept_of_Norms_to_Reduce_Littering_in_Public_Places\\"
    title=\\"I believe this is also discussed in Cialdini&#39;s classic, _Influence_. Side note: There were many PSAs on this theme in the 1970s and 80s and not all of them made the stategic error of implying that littering was normal.\\"
  >
    backfired
  </a>
  . 
It was lamenting how ubiquitous litter was, showed a park strewn with trash, and asked, &#8220;if you don&#8217;t give a hoot, who(ooo) will?&#8221; 
It just made people feel like they might as well litter because everyone else was.
In other words, stating a rule can backfire by conveying that it&#8217;s a big enough problem to need a rule.
</p>
<p>
  So that&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve resisted blogging this.
But on the occasions it came up, I felt bad telling people they broke a rule that was never written down anywhere.
So now it&#8217;s written down.

</p>
<p>
  In conclusion, fake data is gross, shameful, Beeminder-destroying and the most brilliant, effective Beeminder users never even consider it.
How&#8217;s that for norm-shaping?
We&#8217;ll stop short of adding images of squished spiders but a disgust reaction is basically what we&#8217;re aiming to cultivate.
Sorry, I know this was all obvious to most of you.

  Greetings not-so-fat cyclists!
We&#8217;re pretty much beside ourselves with how the first annual (oh presumption!) Beeminder Fat Cyclist Weight Loss Competition turned out.
When we say we&#8217;re beside ourselves we mean that literally &#8212; Beeminder is a husband-and-wife team and we hack on it day and night shoulder-to-shoulder.
Ok, but also figuratively beside ourselves.
This thing had everything:
drama and suspense on the
  <a
    href=\\"http://beeminder.com/fatcyclist/leaderboard\\"
    title=\\"Amazingly no ties in the top ten\\"
  >
    leaderboard
  </a>
  ,
you all lost a ton of weight, 
and we raised just over $4000 for
  <a
    href=\\"http://teamwbr.worldbicyclerelief.org/hammer\\"
    title=\\"As of this writing she&#39;s approaching just $1000 to go on her $20k goal!\\"
  >
    The Hammer&#8217;s World Bicycle Relief fundraising
  </a>
  .
</p>
<p>
  And when we say you all lost a ton of weight we mean that literally too.
(We&#8217;re very literal. It&#8217;s a programmer thing.)
To be exact, you lost a total of 1912 pounds, or 14 pounds per person.
</p>
<p>
  Let&#8217;s back up for those just tuning in. 
In March
  <a
    href=\\"http://www.fatcyclist.com/2014/03/04/you-me-beeminder-weight-loss-with-accountability-starting-today/\\"
    title=\\"Original announcement of the contest on Fat Cyclist\\"
  >
    Fatty announced
  </a>
  a new kind of weight loss contest using Beeminder where the objective would be consistent progress, not about how much you could lose or how fast.
There&#8217;s a
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/fatty/\\">
    shorter version on the Beeminder blog
  </a>
  .
The extra short version is that you create a Yellow Brick Road to your goal weight &#8212; totally up to you to pick it &#8212; and then you get points each day you weigh in based on how closely you hew to your chosen path. 
Importantly, you get fewer points for losing weight faster than you intended.
As for what good the points were, we&#8217;ll get to that.
</p>
<p>
  To limit the contest to those who were ready to take it seriously, Fatty decided on a $20 ante to charity.
That&#8217;s where most of the $4000 we raised came from &#8212; more than $3000 of it.
As for the rest of it, well, this is the crazy part.
Losing weight too fast cost you points.
But actually failing to lose weight?
That cost you money.
Not the first time, that one&#8217;s free, but each subsequent time you derailed, as we call it, from your Yellow Brick Road, you coughed up ever greater penalties: $5, $10, $30, $90, etc.
Normally those penalties are Beeminder&#8217;s revenue.
For this contest we donated half of them to World Bicycle Relief.
</p>
<p>
  Of course the top competitors never went off track.
And that brings us to the exciting part.
I hope you&#8217;re imagining a drum roll right now.
  <a

    title=\\"Ringcycles&#39;s epic weight graph on Beeminder\\"

    Ringcycles
  </a>
  eked out a victory with a
  <em>
    near
  </em>
  perfect score of 304 points.
His prize is a pair of Rapha Classic Bib Shorts, courtesy of Fatty himself.
</p>
<p>
  The contest started out slow, the pack holding together like a peloton. 
But the competition thinned over the course of the first few weeks, and eventually we got down to just a handful of people vying for the top slot. 
Mukrider and Actionplant held out longest with perfect scores, but eventually slipped.
Ringcycles started out with a couple datapoints below the road so didn&#8217;t appear as a top contender at first, but then his subsequent rock solid consistency eventually paid off.
Nobody else ended up as close to a perfect score (306 points).
</p>
<p>
  Honorable mention goes to third place,

    Dena
  </a>
  , 
who had some serious medical issues to contend with but anticipated them almost flawlessly.
When her doctor put her on a clear liquid diet, she adjusted the steepness of her Yellow Brick Road accordingly (you&#8217;re always allowed to do that with Beeminder, the catch being that any changes have a one-week delay).
The most impressive part is that she&#8217;s still forging ahead now that the contest is over.
Check out that graph!
</p>
<p>
  That brings us to our final plea.
The contest was structured to encourage you to lose weight steadily, following the path you set out for yourself, i.e., staying on Beeminder&#8217;s yellow brick road.
We wanted to encourage sustainable weight loss, rather than just dropping weight like The Hammer dropping Fatty on the descent at Frog Hollow.
So even though the contest is over, we want to encourage you to continue minding your weight.
If you&#8217;re now at your ideal weight, set your yellow brick road flat, and keep weighing in, to ensure you don&#8217;t squander all this progress.
You can even set your road to slope up during vacations or holidays if you&#8217;re ok with gaining weight during those times.
The pattern we&#8217;ve seen over and over is that as soon as you

  To be precise, we&#8217;ve actually changed the weight loss rules slightly for the purposes of this contest. 
Your yellow brick road will have a fixed width of 2 pounds on either side of the centerline. 
After some discussion this seemed most fair, since the width of your road affects the points you accrue.

    How to Beat Procrastination
  </a>
  ”) 
depict the different pieces of our personalities that contribute to procrastination in a charming, relatable, and all-too-familiar way.
</p>
<p>
  There’s the Rational Decision Maker trying to keep all of our long-term goals in mind and steer us accordingly, in a balanced way. 
There&#8217;s the Instant Gratification Monkey who takes control of the helm from time to time. 
Then there&#8217;s the Panic Monster who comes out and scares the pants off of the monkey when a deadline gets dangerously close, causing it to give control back to the Rational Decision Maker.
</p>
<p>
  Luckily for me, I have a vigilant and trigger-happy Panic Monster, a relatively phobic Instant Gratification Monkey, and a life structured such that I never get the opportunity to fall into the range of the &#8220;disastinator” or “impostinator” types of procrastinators (who can&#8217;t ever motivate themselves to do anything important to them). 
Still, I’ve spent more than my fair share of time in the Dark Playground, a place where we find that wasteful mix of doing things we might otherwise find pleasurable, but that are sullied by the anxiety and guilt that come with putting off something we should be doing.
And I&#8217;ve spent much less time than I would like to with the want-to-do-but-don’t-
  <em>
    have
  </em>
  -to-do tasks.
</p>
<p>
  Even more fortunate for me, though, is the fact that a couple of years ago I discovered something that my Instant Gratification Monkey finds almost as frightful as the Panic Monster, most of the time, but that my Rational Decision Maker doesn’t really mind all that much: bees.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;The monkey just doesn&#8217;t care about next week&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  In January of 2013, I stumbled onto Beeminder. 
The idea is that you set a goal and you have to stick to whatever you’ve set for yourself or you pay money (i.e. get stung by the bee). 
It’s amazingly simple, but surprisingly terrifying to the Instant Gratification Monkey. 
What’s even better is that you can change your goal as you go (in case you discover that your goal wasn’t realistic over the long haul) but changes only take effect a week after they’re made. 
This gives the Instant Gratification Monkey little incentive to convince the Rational Decision Maker to change plans when that isn’t genuinely useful, because the monkey just doesn’t care about next week.
</p>
<p>
  At first, I had just one little beehive that I would drag out and set beside the steering wheel to keep the monkey at bay for a goal type that is particularly high-risk for procrastination: writing a Master’s thesis. 
Now, I have beehives peppered throughout the Dark Playground, too. 
The monkey isn’t actually all that unhappy, either, because spending more time doing things I need to do and find important allows me to let it loose in the Happy Playground, where genuine relaxation and rejuvenation can happen after the day’s share of other important things have been done.
Many of the non-crucial goals have been set up to require only minimal effort as I get my feet wet with them, to keep from overdoing it or changing too much too quickly. (I’ll say more about that in a future post.)
</p>
<p>
  All in all, my beekeeping Rational Decision Maker is happy more of the time; 
the monkey is surprisingly fine with it (so long as I keep the balance reasonable&#8230; which I’ve had to work on); 
and the Panic Monster has had to find a part-time job scaring children in the haunted house at a local theme park, as it’s spending a lot less time chasing the monkey away.

    Beeminding All The Things
  </a>
  &#8221;, 
I explained my approach and some of the lessons I&#8217;ve learned over the past five years of using Beeminder.
I also promised a tour of my 50 goals, so let&#8217;s dive in.
</p>
<p>
  I&#8217;ve sorted my goals into six main categories:
health, personal, household, spiritual, productivity, and work.
There is definitely some overlap, but overall I was surprised how neatly my goals fell out into these categories, and how evenly spread they are.
Perhaps even thinking through these categories might help inspire you with new ideas.
You may also come up with other categories of your own.
Note, for example, that I have no category for family; personally, spending time with family is something I don&#8217;t seem to need Beeminder goals for at the moment, but perhaps you do.
</p>
<p>
  Many of my goals use various automated data sources (like
  <a
    href=\\"https://github.com/tagtime/TagTime\\"
    title=\\"So-called stochastic time-tracking for space cadets\\"
  >
    TagTime
  </a>
  and
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/ifttt\\"
    title=\\"If This Then That\\"
  >
    IFTTT
  </a>
  ), 
but it would be tedious to list all the details about every goal.
If you want to know more about any particular goal, ask in the comments or the

<h2>
  Health
</h2>
<p>
  I like being healthy (who doesn&#8217;t?) but without Beeminder, well, health is one of those things that is never urgent.
Fortunately, I eat healthy food since my wife is an amazing chef and we love eating lots of high-quality, fresh ingredients (because it tastes good, not necessarily because it&#8217;s healthy).
However, I tend to eat too much.
I used to have a weight loss goal which was helpful for a while: I went from 190 pounds down to 170.
But it was more the novelty of a shiny graph and a Withings (now Nokia) scale that helped.
Weight loss goals violate the principle of
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/whattomind\\"
    title=\\"Side note from the Beeminder founders to point out that if you&#39;re down with intermittent fasting you can make your weight be a metric you have full, daily control over.

  >
    tracking inputs, not outputs
  </a>
  .
So I stopped tracking it and, surprise, my weight went back up.
Now I have a

    <strong>
      bites
    </strong>
  </a>
  , 
which has worked really well for me.
I am back down to a healthy 170 and maintaining it.
</p>
<p>
  Left to my own devices I also tend not to drink enough water, which leads to dehydration and lots of trouble with my sinuses.
So I have a

  </a>
  .
I have measured the containers I usually drink water out of (my water bottle, mugs and glasses at home, etc.) and just estimate otherwise.
I record a data point every time I finish drinking the water in a given container.
</p>
<p>
  I have goals for miscellaneous personal care:

I also have a goal to
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/byorgey/flu-shot\\"
    title=\\"Stairsteppy\\"
  >
    get a
    <strong>
      flu shot
    </strong>
    once a year
  </a>
  &#8212;
especially important since I have small children &#8212; and this goal works great.
Normally getting a flu shot is one of those things that I vaguely know I ought to do, but it&#8217;s too easy to put off.
It&#8217;s really helpful to have a bright deadline for doing it each fall.
This probably wouldn&#8217;t work with something that required more advance planning (setting up an appointment with a doctor, etc.), but getting a flu shot is easy.
A lot of pharmacies offer them on a walk-in basis, and typically my employer has a day when they bring in some nurses to administer flu shots to employees as well.
If for some reason getting a flu shot required more advance planning, I would just make a Beeminder goal to
  <em>
    make a flu shot appointment
  </em>
  .
If I was worried I might make an appointment but then blow it off, I&#8217;d keep both goals.
</p>
<h2>
  Personal
</h2>
<p>
  In general, things in this category are practices that increase my personal and/or relational well-being, but which I wouldn&#8217;t do without forcing myself to.
</p>
<p>
  I realized a while ago that my well-being increases when I
  <strong>
    write regularly in a journal
  </strong>
  , 
but it&#8217;s one of those things I pretty much never do spontaneously.
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/byorgey/journal-pages\\"
    title=\\"A previous incarnation for journal entries is now archived\\"

    My goal
  </a>
  is to write two pages per week.
Usually I write two separate one-page entries but sometimes I write longer ones.
</p>
<p>
  I love
  <strong>
    reading
  </strong>
  but I need a

    href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/byorgey/reading\\"
    title=\\"256 hours of reading and counting. That came out wrong. It&#39;s just 256 hours of reading. Not counting.\\"
  >
    Beeminder goal
  </a>
  to give myself an excuse to do it.
It simply tracks the amount of time spent reading, and only reading for pleasure counts.
Reading academic papers or blog posts doesn&#8217;t count (I have a separate goal for that).
Currently I&#8217;m reading a

    title=\\"It won a Hugo in 2016\\"
  >
    The Fifth Season by N. K. Jemisin
  </a>
  (both highly recommended).
</p>
<p>
  Throughout the year there are various
  <strong>
    celebratory occasions
  </strong>
  (birthdays, Mothers&#8217; Day, anniversaries, Christmas&#8230;) with associated social expectations (gifts, cards, special breakfasts&#8230;).
These used to stress me out to no end, because my natural tendency is to chafe at the social expectations and procrastinate on preparations, until doing something in a panic at the last possible minute (often with not so great results).
I now have a
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/byorgey/celebration\\"
    title=\\"Yayyyyy\\"
  >
    celebration goal
  </a>
  which requires 1 point per week.
To get a point for the goal, I must look at a calendar for the next two weeks, note any upcoming celebrations, and then either take concrete actions to prepare for ones coming up within the week (order gifts, look up recipes, etc.) or spend time brainstorming ideas for any coming up within two weeks.
This goal is super annoying, but that&#8217;s the point: it&#8217;s going to be annoying either way but at least now I&#8217;m not stressed about it.
</p>
<p>
  I love
  <strong>
    playing the piano
  </strong>
  and have played since I was four, so you&#8217;d think I wouldn&#8217;t need a goal for it; but sometimes it&#8217;s hard to make time for it in the midst of everything else going on.
By default I also tend to just play what I already know instead of working to improve.
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/byorgey/piano\\"
    title=\\"140 hours of piano playing\\"

    This goal
  </a>
  ensures I spend a certain amount of time on deliberate piano practice; I increase and decrease it depending on what else is going on.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, I have a goal to
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/byorgey/media\\"
    title=\\"Maybe this would count for a Family category of goals\\"
  >
    upload media

  &#8212; 
the purpose is to make sure I am regularly uploading pictures and videos (mostly of our kids) in order to
  <strong>
    stay in touch with extended family
  </strong>
  .

  I am a Christian, and Beeminder has been very helpful in developing and maintaining disciplined spiritual habits

</p>
<p>
  After we purchased our house a couple years ago, we found and modified a list of
  <strong>
    house maintenance tasks
  </strong>
  organized by monthly, quarterly,
biannual, and annual tasks.
They range from, e.g., checking the fire extinguisher pressure level (monthly) to inspecting the exterior of the house for cracks or any problems (annually).
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/byorgey/house\\"
    title=\\"Measured in items\\"
  >
    This goal
  </a>
  ensures that I do one thing from the list every few days.
Every single thing on the list is something I would never do unless forced.
I like how this goal subsumes lots of things that would be difficult or annoying to make individual goals for, and that it gives me some flexibility in choosing which tasks I want to do when.

<h2>
  Productivity
</h2>
<p>
  I have a number of &#8220;meta&#8221; productivity goals which are not about any work in particular but are designed to help keep me productive.
There is a lot of overlap between these goals and my work goals.
Any given activity might result in data points on two or three goals.
For example, I might do a pomodoro to work deeply on preparing for a lecture. 
At the end of the pomodoro I get a point for my pomodoro goal; plus if I got a TagTime ping during the pomodoro I get 45 minutes for my

  goal and my

  </a>
  goal.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;I have a meta-goal to ensure that I create something every day&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  After several very annoying episodes of forgetting to dial down my goals before a vacation or some other exceptional circumstance (and then having to decide whether to claim not legit on a bunch of derailments, or work super hard to build up enough buffer, or whatever) I decided the solution was to make yet another goal, to
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/byorgey/dial\\"
    title=\\"Dial as in the road dial; road as in the yellow brick road\\"
  >
    <strong>
      dial my Beeminder roads weekly
    </strong>
  </a>
  .
To get a point, I have to look at a calendar and put in breaks or rate changes for any events coming up within
  <em>
    two
  </em>
  weeks.
It&#8217;s important for it to be
  <em>
    two
  </em>
  weeks since it has to account for the akrasia horizon
  <em>
    plus
  </em>
  the fact that I only do this goal once a week; anything more than two
weeks out will still be beyond the akrasia horizon the next time I dial my roads.
Since instituting this goal I have had zero episodes of awkward non-goal-dialing.
Except for instances where, in my hubris, I
  <em>
    deliberately chose
  </em>
  not to dial down some goals even though in retrospect I probably should have.
</p>
<p>
  I have a meta-goal to ensure that I
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/byorgey/create\\"
    title=\\"Just passed 100 days\\"
  >
    <strong>
      create something every day
    </strong>
  </a>
  ,
as opposed to only doing non-creative/administrative tasks like responding to emails, filling out forms, submitting reports, etc.
This is important both metaphysically &#8212; being creative is one of my core values &#8212; and also practically, since creating increases my sense of well-being.
I created this goal because I was finding it was becoming too easy to go through a day finding ways to satisfy all my Beeminder goals by doing menial or trivial work that wasn&#8217;t really productive in a larger sense.

  I have a

  </a>
  );
the act of updating it also helps me reflect on what big projects I want to be focusing on, and whether I have been working on the things I said I want to be working on. 
I also have a goal to write out

    title=\\"Over 100 reviews written now\\"

    <strong>

  To ensure I am getting deep and concentrated work done, I have two goals: one to

and one to ensure I

    spend a certain amount of time

    </strong>
  </a>
  .
</p>
<p>
  Finally, I have two goals specifically to limit the amount of time I spend doing things that have at one point or another taken over too much of my time:

<h2>
  Work
</h2>
<p>
  Last but not least, I have a number of goals related to specific work tasks or projects.
My work typically falls under one of the umbrellas of research, teaching, or open source.
</p>
<p>
  On the research side, I have a goal simply to
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/byorgey/research\\"
    title=\\"1739 hours, tracked with TagTime\\"
  >
    work on
    <strong>
      research
    </strong>
  </a>
  (defined as anything leading towards publishable results).
The rate on this goal fluctuates a lot depending on the season. 
I also
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/byorgey/reading-ac\\"
    title=\\"150 hours in the past 3.5 years\\"
  >
    spend time
    <strong>
      reading academic papers and blog posts
    </strong>
  </a>
  , 
to learn things and keep current in my field.
</p>
<p>
  During the semester, I
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/byorgey/grading\\"
    title=\\"Going on 200 total hours in the last 2 years\\"
  >
    spend time
    <strong>

    </strong>
  </a>
  each week, and
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/byorgey/prep\\"
    title=\\"Going on 400 hours in the last 2 years\\"
  >
    <strong>
      preparing for class
    </strong>
  </a>
  . 
Although they are inactive at the moment, this past semester I also had some specific goals to complete daily checklists for each of my courses 
(
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/byorgey/checklist365\\"
    title=\\"These are course numbers\\"
  >
    checklist365
  </a>
  and
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/byorgey/checklist150\\"
    title=\\"These are course numbers\\"
  >
    checklist150
  </a>
  ).
I am still figuring out the best way to use Beeminder to stay on top of my courses during the semester, but this checklist thing worked pretty well.
The checklists require me to do things like make sure I&#8217;ve prepared a homework assignment for the week, remember to upload any code or lecture notes from in class to the course website, think ahead about planning for exams, and so on.
</p>
<p>
  Also falling generally under the umbrella of teaching, I

    title=\\"227 total posts in going on 5 years so less than 1 per week overall on average\\"

  .
</p>
<p>
  The only specifically open-source related goal I have at the moment is my

  .
We&#8217;ve had a lot of people ask for this integration, and even a few who have already started automatically sending their Fitbit data to Beeminder with
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/api\\">
    our API
  </a>
  (thanks especially to
  <a href=\\"http://retostamm.com/\\">
    Reto Stamm
  </a>
  who helped push us along in getting this officially integrated).
</p>
<p>
  You can choose among five different Fitbit data sets to track: 
Weight
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"WEI1\\"
    href=\\"#WEI\\"
  >
    [1]

We&#8217;ll be adding more datasets to this list soon, so if you have one that you want to see added, let us know in the comments. 
(UPDATE: we added stairs/floors too. Another UPDATE: and a bunch of other things.)
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;Your Beeminder graph will update automatically.&#8221;

<p>
  After you choose the Fitbit data set, Beeminder will go fetch all of your historical data (this can take a few minutes if you have a lot!). 
Your Yellow Brick Road starts today, so just keep using your Fitbit like you normally do and your Beeminder graph will update automatically.
</p>
<p>
  The first time you set up a Fitbit goal, you&#8217;ll be prompted to allow Beeminder to access your Fitbit data; this is a one-time step.

  The Year in Review
</h2>
<p>
  New integrations for getting data into Beeminder this year are from

  The Beeminder-related science news this year included the crumbling of a whole subfield of psychology &#8212;

    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/ego/\\"
    title=\\"Ego Depletion Depletion\\"

  &#8212; which prompted us to write about our own opinions on

There was also a

    title=\\"We&#39;re not sure yet how much stock to put in this but it sure does flatter our biases!\\"
  >
    large meta-study on the advantages of monitoring goal progress
  </a>
  .
And it&#8217;s not new science but since it&#8217;s on theme, we wrote a little about the economic concept of
  <a

  .
</p>
<p>
  Behind the scenes of Beeminder there&#8217;s been a ton of work, like server infrastructure and cleaning out our codebase. 
Bethany
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/mongoid/\\"
    title=\\"MongoMapper to Mongoid; Or, Breaking All The Things\\"
  >
    migrated
  </a>
  us to a new ORM (for non-nerds, this is a similar amount of work to packing your entire house and then unpacking it all again), 
cloudified our storage of graphs, and 
learned a whole bunch of stuff about dev-ops, like fully scripting the deployment of a fresh instance of Beeminder so that if/when the data center serving up our humble website disappears in a ball of fire we&#8217;re a few clicks away from making it all reappear like a phoenix in some less incendiary location.
</p>
<p>
  More front endian, we added a
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/road\\"
    title=\\"Keyword is still &#39;rudimentary&#39; -- it&#39;s not for the faint of heart just yet\\"

    rudimentary road editor
  </a>
  for people who&#8217;re so far down the rabbit hole they emerged on the other side, and a very useful feature for premium subscribers:
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/weekends\\"
    title=\\"This one is also considered a power user feature but we&#39;re not sure it should be because it&#39;s just a checkbox and most Just Works\\"
  >
    automatic weekends off
  </a>
  .
And we ended all that
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/deathtofreebees\\"
    title=\\"Death To Freebees; Or, Freebees Für Alles\\"
  >
    nonsense with so-called freebee goals
  </a>
  . 
Now you can start any goal at $0 any time you want.
</p>
<p>
  Other highly visible changes include a
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/infinibee\\"
    title=\\"Announcing the Infinibee Plan and Other Premium Changes\\"
  >
    revamping of our premium plans
  </a>
  . 
Beeminder is still free if you stay on track towards your goals but you can no longer create an unlimited number of goals without getting on our cheapest premium plan.
Also new is a charity option in our most expensive premium plan.
In sadder news, we officially ended our Beekeeper life-coaching plan.
As we said in the announcement of the new plans, we&#8217;ll focus on what we&#8217;re best at &#8212; building very nerdy tools &#8212; and leave lifecoaching to the lifecoaches.
</p>
<p>
  The splashiest new newness, of course, is the

  look at it).
It puts a strong emphasis on a list-view of your goals, giving you individual data entry right from the list, and trying to bring the relevant info &#8212; how much and how soon &#8212; into the forefront for newbees.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, though most are too minor to be noteworthy, we made 365 User-Visible Improvements to Beeminder in the past 365 days.
And in fact over 2000 UVIs in the past 2000 days.
It&#8217;s been over 1000 days &#8212; almost 3 years &#8212; since we&#8217;ve failed to

  in time and paid one of you $1000.
We&#8217;re probably overdue and in fact could cough that $1000 up many times and have it all still be thoroughly worth it.

    committed
  </a>
  to the unthinkable: 
getting day jobs if we couldn&#8217;t make revenue grow in 2016.
We were already profitable but just barely and needed a kick in the pants, so we gave ourselves one.
Of course we beemind myriad inputs to growing Beeminder &#8212; user-visible improvements, blog posts, hours of work,
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/tocks/\\"
    title=\\"Tocks are 45-minute pomodoros\\"
  >
    tocks
  </a>
  , etc &#8212; but beeminding outputs, like revenue, is harder.
So we tried it the old-fashioned way and put ourselves on the hook by publicly announcing some dire consequences for failing to make Beeminder grow.
Our main strategy here was the premium revamp to get more hardcore folks paying monthly, and the redesign, to keep most newbees from fleeing in terror upon loading the site.
</p>
<p>
  Note the nice jump in revenue which means our 2016 commitment device has paid off and Beeminder will flourish into 2017 and beeyond:

  We&#8217;ve been aided immensely in the push to grow faster by having Andy Brett come back in full force.
And as of last month we have

    Lillian Karabaic as Minister of the Exterior
  </a>
  &#8212; i.e., marketing and finance &#8212; which, it&#8217;s abundantly clear, is about to translate into more revenue growth.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, we also added Alice Harris, aka Alys, this year, as Habitica Liaison.
She both helps improve the Beeminder-Habitica integration and, like all of us, helps with support.
Habitica, thanks to Alys, is now tied with
  <a
    href=\\"http://collegeinfogeek.com\\"
    title=\\"Recommended!\\"
  >
    CollegeInfoGeek
  </a>
  as our top source of new Beeminder users.
</p>
<p>
  This all makes our team sound bigger than it is though.
Only Danny and Bee and occasionally Andy are full-time.
Changing that is our biggest incentive to keep revenue growing.
</p>
<h2>
  Most Important Thing
</h2>
<p>
  The last couple years we put ourselves on the hook for some set of features / milestones we were going to reach before the year was up. 
That led to getting things done, but also scrambling last minute and of course, breaking things.
</p>
<p>
  This year we pledged instead to
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/hardsoon/\\"
    title=\\"Hard-Committing To Do Something &#39;Soon&#39;\\"
  >
    keep 50% of our hours on whatever was the next Most Important Thing
  </a>
  . 
We pay out pledges from derailments on those goals
  <a
    href=\\"http://forum.beeminder.com/t/take-the-beeminder-founders-money/799\\"
    title=\\"Forum post where you can claim our money\\"

    to users
  </a>
  .
</p>
<p>
  Danny&#8217;s been stuck all year on taming his email as his Most Important Thing, the bane of the CEO role.
But Bethany, the CTO, i.e, the one who actually builds everything, worked on
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/b/bupgrades\\"
    title=\\"5 years is a long time in internet time\\"

  </a>
  and paid out a max pledge of $270 to a lucky user.
Then came

    title=\\"Bee&#39;s beeminding of the premium revamp\\"

  </a>
  also only went as high as $30 paid (final pledge $90), and Bee&#8217;s current Most Important Thing is

    title=\\"Bee&#39;s beeminding of S3 and Linode maintenance\\"

    server infrastructure
  </a>
  . 
Keep an eye on that one and if she falls behind you can currently earn $90 out of her pocket.

  The problem of self-control may be a ridiculous first world problem but it&#8217;s the granddaddy of first world problems and I want to solve it.
We live amidst a deluge of opportunities for instant gratification, especially in the form of food and entertainment, and most of us don&#8217;t handle it well.
The general problem, known as

    title=\\"Inaugural post on the Beeminder blog. See also the sidebar on the blog.\\"

  </a>
  , is this: 
you understand your own best interests when you consider them dispassionately, but in the moment your decision-making is distorted.
The best time for, say, a workout is always &#8220;tomorrow&#8221;.
And the best time to start working is after &#8220;just one more&#8221; clip of [redacted; save yourself!] on YouTube.
Knowing that the problem boils down to time scales

    commitment devices
  </a>
  .
For example, many people buy cost-inefficient individual-sized packs of cigarettes or candy, paying a premium to throttle their future consumption.
Deleting games from your computer or going somewhere without internet access to get work done is another common example.
You need to lock yourself in to your chosen course of action, like maintaining a healthy weight, eating right, or getting blog posts written every month.
</p>
<p>
  When we wrote about this for the

    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/akrasia\\"
    title=\\"How To Do What You Want: Akrasia and Self-Binding\\"
  >
    inaugural post on this blog
  </a>
  , we included a straw poll with a slew of commonly used commitment devices.
As we pointed out then, the tricks and lifehacks on that list are surprisingly toothless &#8212; they&#8217;re mostly band-aid solutions.
Economists have been wondering for at least half a century why we don&#8217;t see more serious use of commitment devices in the real world.
But they&#8217;ve had an answer for equally long.
As Robert Strotz speculated in 1955
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"RHS1\\"
    href=\\"#RHS\\"
  >
    [1]
  </a>
  , the reason is risk and uncertainty, &#8220;both as to future tastes and future opportunities.&#8221;

  This should be obvious to our data-nerd readers.
We sometimes call it the Principle of Delayed Commitment: the simple decision-theoretic fact that you shouldn&#8217;t commit to a course of action until you have to.
Flexibility is valuable; laziness is a virtue.
For example, you shouldn&#8217;t toggle the state of the toilet seat after you use it because you don&#8217;t know what state the next person will want it in.
What if you expend the effort toggling only to have the next person to use the bathroom, perhaps you, toggle it right back?
Such waste!
I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m preaching to the choir here.

  Or take going to the gym. You shouldn&#8217;t pay for a membership if you can, for a similar price, pay as you go.
After all, in the future you may decide not to go to the gym, making pay-as-you-go cheaper, in expectation.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;Two forms of irrationality can cancel each other out&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  But you know where this is going. Yes, you might well decide not to go to the gym, but it probably won&#8217;t be a rational decision.
The solution, ironically, is
  <em>
    more irrationality
  </em>
  .
Commitment devices blatantly violate the principle of delayed commitment, removing future flexibility for no reason other than to thwart your future self.
But if that impetuous version of yourself will undermine your own goals (such as getting in shape) then that&#8217;s quite rational from your current perspective.
Two forms of irrationality can cancel each other out.
Which is to say that if you irrationally over-weight immediate consequences &#8212; if you&#8217;re
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/akratic\\"
    title=\\"Akratics Anonymous\\"

  </a>
  &#8212; then you should &#8220;irrationally&#8221; pre-commit.
</p>
<p>
  A gym membership is a literal commitment contract, albeit a weak one.
It turns the gym fees into a

    title=\\"Hyper-Correcting for the Sunk-Cost Fallacy\\"

  , committing you to pay whether you visit the gym or not.
Commitment devices may be an old idea but they&#8217;re enjoying a

  But we&#8217;d like to make those two irrationalities cancel each other out while minimizing the collateral damage.
In other words, bind yourself with a commitment device that thwarts your akrasia while retaining maximum flexibility as to future tastes and future opportunities.

      (like, 40 hours of actual focused work per week is damn hard!).
That sounds like it defeats the point of a commitment contract, but
recall the fundamental problem of akrasia: over-weighting immediate consequences.
To beat akrasia you only need to bind yourself for whatever the horizon on &#8220;immediate&#8221; is.

      Just commit to progress.
You don&#8217;t have to know what you&#8217;re committing to when you commit, which also sounds (oxy)moronic but what I mean is this:
Commit to keeping your data points on a path to your goal (the &#8220;yellow brick road&#8221;) that you have control over as you go, subject to the akrasia horizon. 
That is, commit to something like &#8220;work out more&#8221; or &#8220;lose weight&#8221; and then decide as you go what that means based on your data.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  So a maximally flexible self-control tool is one that commits you to keeping all your data points on a path to your goal that you specify and can change the steepness of at any time.
The only part of the path that&#8217;s fixed is the upcoming week.

  You may be wondering how anyone could ever fail to stick to a commitment that&#8217;s this flexible.
Here&#8217;s how: if you&#8217;re highly akratic.
Such a person may well find it a daily struggle to stay on track.
Yeah, you can always choose to wuss out and flatten the yellow brick road, but only starting in a week, which you don&#8217;t want to do.
You want to wuss out Right Now, dammit!
I mean, just for now, while you eat this pie, and then you&#8217;ll behave again.
No such luck though.
</p>
<p>
  The daily struggle to stay on the road does not induce you to touch that road dial.
You always want to make it easier &#8220;just for today&#8221; &#8212; which the akrasia horizon doesn&#8217;t allow &#8212; and you always think you&#8217;ll get your act together by next week.

  Eight Hundred Dollar Postscript
</h2>
<p>
  For three years now we&#8217;ve scrambled to make sure a Messy Matters post got out the door at least once in every calendar month.
Such is the powerful psychology of &#8220;don&#8217;t break the chain&#8221;, also known as the

    title=\\"Jerry Seinfeld&#39;s productivity secret is to mark an X on the calendar each day that he writes.

    Seinfeld hack
  </a>
  .
But the Seinfeld hack&#8217;s greatest strength is also its fatal flaw:
Once you do break the chain, all the motivation it provided bursts like a bubble.
You&#8217;ve got to somehow motivate yourself to build up another long chain to not break.
Until then you&#8217;re on a &#8220;one more day won&#8217;t matter&#8221; slippery slope of sloth.

We shall henceforth publish on Messy Matters as often as the following yellow brick road dictates, or give one of you $800.
We&#8217;ll get the added flexibility, of course, to change the rate of posts as needed, subject to the akrasia horizon.
I think it can also add a different kind of flexibility and help prevent end-of-month all-nighters:
If we publicize a draft of a post (to the hard-core Messy Matters readers who follow the

    (&#8220;put a contract out on yourself&#8221;) is missing.
Contracts are part of StickK&#8217;s DNA.

      one of the founders is a contract lawyer
    </a>
    .
In fact, the extra K in the name is for the legal shorthand for &#8220;contract&#8221;.
Beeminder, on the other hand, was co-founded by a Messy Matters blogger and core to its DNA is data.
That&#8217;s what led us to the Akrasia Horizon solution for flexible commitment contracts.
  </p>
  <p>
    (Perhaps surprisingly, it took a ridiculous number of iterations to get to that point.
For the longest time we struggled with different ways to deal with the fact that it&#8217;s so often hard to decide what to commit to. 
We tried many variations of having multiple yellow brick roads for a single goal, so that you could specify an ambitious goal as well as a bare minimum. 
It was always too messy, or would backfire altogether and be paralyzing.
We think the road dial with an akrasia horizon is a big leap forward.
And it seems so obvious in retrospect!)

    You can also change the goal date to any date in the future that you desire, except within the coming week, or leave it open-ended.
Also, if you start with a flat yellow brick road (as Beeminder encourages) then you&#8217;re not making any commitment at all until you can do so informed by your data.

    regular warnings
  </a>
  Beeminder gives are so useful, I then misremembered our agreed-upon deadline and ended up drafting this whole post the night it was due. Whoops!)
</p>
<h3>
  Why are you doing this?
</h3>
<p>
  Because I&#8217;ve noticed two problems with how I currently spend my time. 
One is that, despite my best efforts, I still often get distracted while I&#8217;m working. 
I&#8217;ve tried aggressive
  <a
    href=\\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stayfocusd/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji?hl=en\\"
    title=\\"StayFocused Chrome extension, a great way to cut back on Facebook\\"

    StayFocused settings
  </a>
  and I&#8217;ve tried
  <a

    title=\\"RescueTime has a nice post on the Pomodoro Method\\"
  >
    pomos
  </a>
  .
Both have helped but I&#8217;m still more beholden to the distraction economy than I&#8217;d like.
</p>
<p>
  Second, I&#8217;ve noticed that I have a nasty habit of lazing around in bed checking my phone when I should be heading in to work. 
I&#8217;m lucky enough that I don&#8217;t have an official start time, but I still have to work the same amount of time no matter when I get in.
</p>
<p>
  I figured that if I could fix both of these problems, I might get something like an extra half-hour of productivity out of every day.
That might not seem like too much, but I&#8217;ve recently found myself so crunched for time with all of the things that I&#8217;m trying to do that I could
  <em>
    really
  </em>
  use that extra thirty minutes.
</p>
<p>
  I originally intended to also use the button to force myself to go to bed earlier. 
I chickened out of that at first, but having compared my sleep to my
  <a
    href=\\"https://apps.ankiweb.net/\\"
    title=\\"Spaced repetition system for memorizing anything\\"
  >
    Anki
  </a>
  performance (the correlation between my four-day sleep average and my normalized performance is a whopping 0.75), I&#8217;ve decided that I need to beemind going to sleep as well.
</p>
<h3>
  What have the results been?
</h3>
<p>
  Really positive!
</p>
<p>
  Tracking sleep and distractions is definitely a good use for a Bluetooth button. 
These are both areas where having to interact with a computer at all would probably make things worse, even given the benefits of Beeminder. 
Keeping the button on my desk, for handling distractions while I work, has also been great for my getting out of bed goal.
And now every weekday starts with me madly scrambling across the room to get to the button in time, which turns out to be really helpful!
</p>
<p>
  In terms of specific results, I believe my previous median time to get out of bed was 08:45, about 19 minutes after waking up. 
Since getting the Beeminder button working, I&#8217;m now out of bed

    href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/zacharyjacobi/wake\\"
    title=\\"This wake-up goal has been getting me out of bed since January\\"
  >
    by 08:33 at the latest
  </a>
  , 
every work morning, without fail. 
This is twelve bonus minutes that I just got!
</p>
<p>
  I don&#8217;t have much good data about how distracted I am but, anecdotally, my experience has been great. 
Over the past few days, I&#8217;ve even managed to turn reaching for my phone into reaching for the Beeminder button &#8212; and then returning to what I was doing. 
I&#8217;ve also taken to using the button as a pre-emptive measure, clicking it to signal to myself that it&#8217;s time to stop surfing the internet and start working.
</p>

    title=\\"My distractions goal on Beeminder\\"
  >
    I had to use the button once while writing this post
  </a>
  .)
</p>
<p>
  There&#8217;ve been a few minor kinks, some that I have yet to iron out, like how to separate weekend requirements from weekday requirements or days I plan to get extra sleep, how to ignore any data that I enter after my cut-off, and occasional crossed wires between Beeminder, Flic, and the service that ties them together, which I&#8217;ll get to below. 
(Ideas solicited!)
</p>
<p>
  So far, I&#8217;ve gotten around the cut-off issue by having really strict rules with myself (no hitting the button after my wake-up time) and sticking to them. 
In general, I&#8217;ve never found myself tempted to lie to Beeminder, but I&#8217;m looking for ideas about how to have a bit more enforced structure with this goal.
</p>
<p>
  Tracking distractions has been seamless. 
Whenenever I tab out of what I&#8217;m supposed to be doing to browse Facebook or check the news, I hit the button (and try to go back to what I want to be doing). 
My goal is to keep below 12 of these each day and I have Beeminder set up so that a few successful days doesn&#8217;t give me carte blanche to be distracted on subsequent days.
I&#8217;m seriously considering setting up a Flic profile on my work computer so I can track distractions there as well. 
I strongly recommend this use of the button for anyone who finds themselves easily distracted at a computer.

<p>
  First,

    title=\\"The download button is at the bottom of the Flic site\\"

    download the Flic desktop application
  </a>
  . 
Once you have it, hit &#8220;Add new action&#8221; on your Flic controller. 
(You can also use the app, but I found that was very prone to failure.)

Oh, I kept the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads on to way, I doubted if I should ever come back. I shall be telling this with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence: Two roads diverged in a wood, and I— I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference.\\"

  Since we like letting you all peek behind the curtain of Beeminder, let&#8217;s dive in with this internal strategy memo that our beeloved Queen Bee sent to the team last month, reproduced here verbatim:
</p>
<div style=\\"border-style:solid;border-width:1px;padding:10px 70px 20px\\">
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
    Howdy my sweet bee people,
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
    We&#8217;ve subjected you to a lot of polarized ideas about Beeminder pricing over the last month. 
Whee! I&#8217;m sure you were all riveted and popcorn-munching and not at all pantomiming grisly ways to put yourselves out of your miseries.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
    Well here&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve concluded: 
Beeminder is pledge-focused.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
    First off, what this does
    <i>
      not
    </i>
    mean is that we are going to make any immediate or drastic changes. 
For now it just means that when we are considering decisions, like &#8220;how many goals should be allowed on the free plan&#8221;, we use our pledge-focus to guide us to the decision that (drum roll) we should allow more goals on the free plan.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
    One thing that&#8217;s nice about this is that we don&#8217;t have the usual attention / resource drain of the usual freemium service with our pledge-focused world. We still get paid by users in the &#8220;free&#8221; tier.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
    To make this more concrete, here are some things that follow from this Capital-S Strategy:
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Most people should be happy on the free plan; we shouldn&#8217;t push or guilt people into going premium. 
(See section 5, bullet 2 of our 
&#8220;
      <a
        href=\\"https://help.beeminder.com/article/32-what-do-i-do-first\\"
        title=\\"Excerpt: Creating unlimited goals requires a premium plan, and so do certain goal types like odometers. But probably don't jump straight to a premium plan! Core Beeminder is very powerful. And you want to avoid Beeminder burnout.\\"
      >
        What to do first?
      </a>
      &#8221; 
help page.)
    </li>
    <li>
      More free goals, more generosity to people on the free plan.
    </li>
    <li>
      New features go in the free plan.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
    This may mean that we are eventually going to find ourselves in a Beeminder world where there are no premium subscription plans, but it&#8217;s not an imminent thing that any of us need to worry about.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
    (Though it might mean we should stopper new lifetime plans at this point? 
I personally think we should.)

<br>
<p>
  So now I (the King Bee, I guess) am adding some philosophical background and turning it into a blog post.
Let&#8217;s start with a couple things our actual users may actually care about.
</p>
<h2>
  Pragmatic Postscriptum
</h2>
<p>
  As Bee suggested at the end of her memo, we
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/deathtolife\\"
    title=\\"Blog post about killing (stopping selling) lifetime plans\\"
  >
    stoppered new lifetime plans
  </a>
  . That was our previous blog post.
Here&#8217;s a key sentence buried in it:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    As soon as we have even the inkling that perks could go away or become free, it doesn’t feel right to sell them for life anymore.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  That&#8217;s what this post is about.
We&#8217;re not rushing to kill premium perks 
(and see
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/deathtolife/#FP\\"
    title=\\"Excerpt: we could conceivably decide that pledgeless goals should just not be a thing and in that case the Beemium people who paid for that feature could be out of luck. We’re very reluctant to tell people they’re out of luck but we have to be focused on what’s best for Beeminder long-term and not have *too* many balls chained to our ankles. (Pledgeless goals are just an example and we don’t actually plan to get rid of them. We’re just not making infinitely long commitments to specific features, is the point. And if we do kill a feature you specifically paid for, we’ll bend over pretty far backwards to make it fair.)\\"
  >
    the footnote
  </a>
  of the previous post about how reluctant we&#8217;d be to do so)
but we&#8217;re taking our focus off of premium so perk killing and perk freeing are at least possibilities on the table.
Which was the primary impetus to take lifetime plans off the table.
</p>
<p>
  The other immediate practical implication Bee alluded to &#8212; and thanks to

    @shanaqui
  </a>
  who made this finally gel for us &#8212; is that
  <a
    href=\\"http://beeminder.com/changelog#3639\\"
    title=\\"Link to the relevant entry in our changelog, i.e., our list of User-Visible Improvements. There are thousands and thousands of them.\\"
  >
    we made

    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/infinibee\\"
    title=\\"Blog post introducing the premium plan where you have to pay to have unlimited goals\\"
  >
    free plan
  </a>
  only care about actual goals in your gallery, not ever-created goals. 
So you can create goals to your heart&#8217;s delight and archive things to make room for new goals.
I&#8217;m actually embarrassed that this wasn&#8217;t the case all along.
It was what users commonly expected.
Every time it came up, we fell down the &#8220;are we pledge-focused or premium-focused?&#8221; rabbit hole.
So it feels much better to have decided that and to have smaller decisions like that one flow naturally from it.
</p>
<h2>
  The Trilemma
</h2>
<p>
  Let&#8217;s pause here to review the decision we found ourselves staring down.
We thought of it as pledges vs premium but the 3rd option was to continue to focus on both.
Here are the cases for each:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Pledge-focus: 
Death to carrot-dangling (holding important features hostage to entice people to go premium).
Viva la simplicity. 
Premium is only for certain things it definitely makes sense to paywall.
      <a
        class=\\"footnote\\"
        id=\\"PW1\\"
        href=\\"#PW\\"
      >
        [1]
      </a>
      The free plan is as powerful as we can make it.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Premium-focus: 
Extreme carrot-dangling and death or near death to the free plan. 
Advantages include
more predictable revenue, 
better (and more off-the-shelf) analytics, 
easier/cheaper support, 
less scaling, 
less frustration with users who treat Beeminder as a game where the objective is to never ever pay Beeminder a penny. 
It lets us embrace punishment and embrace people who&#8217;re motivated to never ever be punished. 
And no artificial restrictions on how much people can pledge. 
They pay for the service and pledges are icing.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Juggle-blur: 
Arguments for this include inertia and simultaneous cake-having/eating.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Special thanks to the folks in the Beeminder Community Discord for helping with the agonizing.
Here&#8217;s one of the multiple polls I took there:
</p>
<p>
  <img
    class=\\"aligncenter\\"
    alt=\\"Poll between pledge-focus (6 votes), premium-focus (4 votes), and so-called juggle-blur (6 votes)\\"
    title=\\"Blur as in the opposite of focus, get it?\\"
    src=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/discord-screenshot-pledge-poll.png\\"
  >
</p>
<p>
  As you can see, pledge-focus was ahead by a hair.
Though if we&#8217;d gone with actual consensus, the answer would&#8217;ve been to not deviate from the status quo.
</p>
<h2>
  Philosophy Funtimes and Business Strategery
</h2>
<p>
  <img
    src=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/why-not-both.png\\"

  That brings us to the obvious question (see illustration at right).
You saw part of the answer in the Pragmatic Postscriptum above.
So many choices get so much less agonizing if we don&#8217;t try to have our cake and eat it too.
We talk about this more generally in what we immodestly think of as our classic post &#8212; at least we refer to it to each other all the time &#8212; on
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/eggbasket\\"
    title=\\"The principle: put all your eggs in one basket. Be laser-focused on the one thing you&#39;re best at. Do not diversify. The post also talks about how if we&#39;d understood the principle when we started we would never have introduced premium plans in the first place.\\"

  </a>
  . Diversification is the death of small businesses.
</p>
<p>
  So that&#8217;s why not both.
Then why not premium?
Our answer is that to be sustainable as a bootstrapped business with premium plans as your primary source of revenue, you have to make painful tradeoffs to get people to pony up or GTFO.
Premium-focus necessarily means pricing most people out.
</p>
<p>
  Unless you use a generous freemium model.
But that

  >
    doesn&#8217;t work for bootstrapped businesses
  </a>
  .
It works for VC-funded startups who can afford to sacrifice revenue for growth.
That is not us.
</p>
<p>
  Beeminder is very unique in the business strategy we have available to us and it&#8217;s a powerful one.
Being pledge-focused we don&#8217;t have to price most people out after a brief trial period in order to make money.
Anyone (who&#8217;s sufficiently

  ) eventually make money in proportion to how much value that person gets out of Beeminder.
</p>
<p>
  With pledge-focus, we still have to make sacrifices for the sake of revenue but they&#8217;re much smaller than with premium-focus.
Namely, we have to have pledge floors and no pledge

  Conclusion
</h2>
<p>
  So there you have it.
We&#8217;ve stopped selling lifetime plans, made the free plan a bit more generous, and intend to continue to gradually shift emphasis away from premium plans, albeit with a fairly long list of principled exceptions.

  We don&#8217;t think this will involve any regrets for anyone who has a premium plan but we&#8217;re eager to keep getting feedback about that as we make more changes.

    e. A badge to show off that you&#8217;re an elite hardcore user

<p>
  Relatedly, here&#8217;s a review of the current premium perks:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      INFINIBEE: 
unlimited goals, 
unlimited goal types (do-less, whittle-down, odometer), 
dogfood bounties
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      BEE PLUS: 
full custom goal types, 
auto-ratchet, 
weekends-off, 
American SMS bot
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      BEEMIUM: 
charity option,
pledgeless goal,
short-circuiting the pledge schedule,
real-time (ish) support
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Infinibee was meant to be necessary for all serious users and for paywalling features that are liable to confuse and consternate newbees (and to mitagate the burden of supporting newbee confusion with such features).
</p>
<p>
  Bee Plus is for power users.
Unfortunately it also includes auto-ratchet and weekends-off, partly because those features can be finicky and fragile and cause server issues, like by spawning an unwieldy number of segments in the function that defines the yellow brick road.
The SMS bot costs a small amount of money, probably not enough to justify it being this expensive.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, Beemium is for revenue-eating, and arguably unbeeminder-y stuff.

  Being a big fan of both Beeminder (obviously!) and Focusmate, I&#8217;m pretty excited about this one, and I know a lot of Beeminder users will be too. 
That&#8217;s right: Beeminder now has an integration with Focusmate!
</p>
<h3>
  A recap on Beeminder
</h3>
<p>
  In case you&#8217;ve followed a link here from the
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.focusmate.com/\\"
    title=\\"Distraction-free productivity / Virtual coworking\\"
  >
    Focusmate
  </a>
  universe and don&#8217;t know about Beeminder, let&#8217;s start with our Beeminder pitch.
</p>
<p>
  Beeminder allows you to visualise data you collect about yourself with our graphs, while also serving as a commitment contract. 
You choose something you want to commit to &#8212; for instance, running three times a week, or perhaps doing two Focusmate sessions a day! &#8212; and we create a graph for you.
</p>
<p>
  The Bright Red Line on that graph shows you what you need to do to meet that goal (your data always needs to be on the right side of that line)&#8230; 
and if you fail at that commitment, we charge you an amount of money you put at stake. 
Once you&#8217;ve set up a commitment contract via creating a graph, you&#8217;re on the hook for at least the next seven days: 
no backing out on the spur of the moment!
</p>
<p>
  One of our most powerful features is our range of integrations which enter data in your graphs automatically. 
You don&#8217;t have to remember to do the task
  <em>
    and
  </em>
  go put it into Beeminder, 
you just have to go ahead and do the thing and we&#8217;ll pick up the info via the integration and update your graph for you.
</p>
<p>
  That&#8217;s really convenient, and at the same time, getting data from our integrations means your goals are already very clearly defined, so there&#8217;s no opportunity to fudge it. 
With a Duolingo-linked goal, for instance, there&#8217;s no opportunity to say &#8220;Well, I did ten minutes of language practice this morning when I read that forum thread in French!&#8221; 
That might well have been great practice, but Beeminder&#8217;s unforgiving: 
you have to get your 20 points in French on Duolingo in order to complete the goal.
</p>
<h3>
  An intro to Focusmate
</h3>
<p>
  That much is all familiar to Beeminder fans, but what about Focusmate?
</p>
<p>
  Well, have you ever noticed how when you&#8217;re working with someone else, you feel pressured to keep focused as long as they are? 
If they&#8217;re still typing away writing the next great novel, then you need to put in your time on your coding or your studying or whittling down your inbox.
</p>
<p>
  Focusmate faciliates that via video calls: 
once signed up, you book a 25- or 50-minute session. 
You&#8217;ll get matched up with another Focusmate user, and the two of you both show up at the appointed time ready to work. 
You introduce yourself quickly, set your goals, and then get to it, and the whole time you can see each other on camera (and potentially hear each other on mic if you&#8217;re both able to do that, i.e. you&#8217;re not in a busy place or anything). 
Just like working next to someone else in a library or a coffee shop, you have that pressure to keep on working, because at the end of the session you need to explain how you got on with your goals.
</p>
<p>
  It&#8217;s not a social call &#8212; you&#8217;re both there to work. 
The idea is that the presence of someone else who is hard at work acts as accountability, and so does the check-in at the start and at the end. 
And in my experience, having to explain to someone else what you have to do also helps you come up with clear goals and use your time wisely!
</p>
<h3>
  Why beemind it?
</h3>
<p>
  I&#8217;ve been using Focusmate for months, and I find it powerful for all kinds of tasks. 
I&#8217;ve had sessions for doing my chores (yep, it quickly becomes obvious when I&#8217;m playing Solitaire rather than dusting my bookshelves), handling emails, studying and, yes, even writing this very blog post! 
I&#8217;ve also used Focusmate for things that are maybe less obvious: during my summer break, I used it to enforce time spent just reading and relaxing. 
No devices (once the session started), no stopping to check my email, no distractions.
</p>
<p>
  I&#8217;ve even had Focusmate sessions where my goal was simply to touch as many of my Beeminder goals as possible, no matter what they&#8217;re about &#8212; my 5-pages-a-day reading goals, physiotherapy exercises, reconciling YNAB, &#8230;
</p>
<p>
  But no matter how powerful and versatile the tool is, you need to remember to use it, and to get the most out of it, you probably need to use it
  <em>
    consistently
  </em>
  . 
That&#8217;s where Beeminder can come in! 
If you have a goal set up to do a session every day, you know you need to book in a session and log in pretty much every day (give or take, since you can build up buffer or set breaks) to spend a session getting stuff done.
</p>
<p>
  We&#8217;re pretty confident that:
</p>
<p>
  a) Beeminder is really useful for people who are using Focusmate to get stuff done, because we allow you to quantify, track, and visualise your progress on all kinds of goals;
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    and
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  b) Focusmate is going to be really powerful for Beeminder users! 
There are so many different ways you can use a 25- or 50-minute session to help you meet your goals, whether that&#8217;s your morning routine, your language practice, or even your meditation goals.
</p>
<h3>
  Okay, how does it work?
</h3>
<p>
  It&#8217;s pretty simple! 
Assuming you have your Beeminder account all set up, then hit the &#8220;Create new goal&#8221; button. 
In the list of integrations, click on the Focusmate logo. 
If you&#8217;ve never created a Focusmate goal before, then you&#8217;ll need to authenticate with Focusmate in this step. 
Just click on &#8220;Connect to Focusmate&#8221;, and then click &#8220;Allow&#8221; on the next page, and that&#8217;ll be all set up.
</p>
<p>
  Next, you need to choose the number of sessions you want to do in a given time period, and you can also choose to start with some extra leeway so you don&#8217;t have to begin right away. 
After that, pick a
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/goalnames/\\"
    title=\\"Beeminder blog post with advice for naming goals -- it&#39;s also fine to wing this\\"
  >
    goalname
  </a>
  and type in a description of the goal if you want to. 
Set up your starting pledge and pledge cap on the next page, and then you can check out the preview of your graph. 
If anything looks wrong, hit back and change it now, but otherwise, hit continue, check your payment details are right, and then hit &#8220;Finish&#8221;. 
Congrats, you&#8217;ve got a Focusmate goal set up!
</p>
<p>
  The goal will automatically update with a new datapoint at the start of each Focusmate session, so you just need to book your sessions, turn up, and get stuff done! 
We&#8217;ll handle the rest.
</p>

  I am not an expert of any kind and I have no training.
I&#8217;m just a guy who used to be pretty uncomfortable (5&#8217;10&#8221; 230lbs) and now is a much happier 175lbs.
Danny thought the lifestyle changes I used to make this happen might be of general interest to the readers of this blog:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    no eating after 8:00pm
  </strong>
  <br>
  This actually does two different things: (1) it means no eating
an entire box of swiss cake rolls at 2:00am and (2) it forces me to
space my meals out reasonably so I don&#8217;t kill and eat my wife Jen in
her sleep &#8212; she frowns on this.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    eat breakfast
  </strong>
  <br>
  This is necessitated by rule #1.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    don&#8217;t drink calories
  </strong>
  <br>
  I know this sounds weird but think about it. 320 calories per
large glass of Dr Pepper is completely insane. &#8220;Diet&#8221; soft drinks
violate the next rule. I drink a LOT of water and some unsweetened
iced tea.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    eat food that is made of food
  </strong>
  <br>
  This is a lot harder than it sounds. It means things like: no
cream horns filled with sweetened petroleum by-product, no Hostess
anything, no fast food anything, no &#8220;diet&#8221; or un-naturally &#8220;low fat&#8221;
foods. This single rule forced me to learn to cook when I lost a 3rd
grader worth of me a few years back.  On a related note:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    eschew goo
  </strong>
  <br>
  This one I actually picked up from my wife&#8217;s normal eating
habits; avoid condiments, dressings, spreads, cheese, etc. that
aren&#8217;t an integral part of the thing you&#8217;re eating.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    eat enough food (but no more)
  </strong>
  <br>
  This is the hardest one for me in both directions. I
  <em>
    really
  </em>
  want to be in better shape again NOW so the temptation is to lop 1000
calories off my required daily intake, suffer like a Jesuit in a
spanking club, and up my daily exercise to
  <a href=\\"http://www-personal.umich.edu/~markusn/\\">
    Markus Nee
  </a>
  -like levels
without fueling it. This is madness &#8212; pure and simple. I&#8217;m also the
guy who easily gets two refill baskets of fries at Red Robin if he&#8217;s
not paying attention. This, in fact, is what the next rule is for.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    track my progress
  </strong>
  <br>
  The simple act of tracking one&#8217;s progress improves that progress
(

    emprically true, at least in some cases
  </a>
  ; this is also known as &#8220;you make what you measure&#8221;).
So I weigh myself every morning, record the data, and, most
importantly, IGNORE THE DAILY DATA.  Daily weight measurements are
inherently noisy and untrustworthy. This is why beeminder is so
great.  Yay, beeminder.

  This is going to sound painfully obvious at first &#8212; &#8220;Don&#8217;t assume you&#8217;ll remember things! Create reminders!&#8221; &#8212; but bear with me.
There are two useful, nonobvious things here:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Sometimes you think of something you need to remember while, say, driving, or talking to someone. 
You can&#8217;t always email yourself or write something down but you can still do something like stick a pencil behind your ear or move your wallet to your other pocket. 
Anything you can count on to break through to your conscious attention later.
We have a whole list of ideas for this.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Just having the term &#8220;plan-to-forget&#8221; helps you notice instances of delusionally planning to remember.

  </a>
  and I were proud to come up with this after too many failed instances of &#8220;remind me to do XYZ&#8221;.
The original instance of putting it into practice was Cantor saying, as we were leaving the house,
&#8220;I need to water my garden. I&#8217;ll do that when we get back.&#8221; 
I asked him how he could plan to forget to do that and he tucked his hair into the back of his hat so that it would fall out when he got home and remind him. 
It worked!
The general advice is, whenever you catch yourself intending to remember to do something, plan to forget instead by doing something that will actually prompt you to remember.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;Whenever you catch yourself intending to remember to do something, plan to forget instead by doing something that will actually prompt you to remember&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  A common one I&#8217;ve used is putting my watch on my other wrist.
One time I needed to remember to mail a letter at the train station.
Emailing myself or writing something down wouldn&#8217;t work because I wouldn&#8217;t be checking my email or any task list.
But I&#8217;d certainly be looking at my watch!
It worked like a charm.
(And intending to remember clearly would&#8217;ve failed.)
</p>
<p>
  Another example was remembering to add a ledger entry for cleaning the kitchen (yes, we all pay each other for chores like this):
As I&#8217;m cleaning the kitchen I think to myself, &#8220;self, remember to ledger this when you&#8217;re done&#8221;. 
And at first that works so I&#8217;m lulled into complacency.
What I should do instead is&#8230;
  <em>
    looking around
  </em>
  &#8230; grab a hat from that shelf and put it on. 
Then when I&#8217;m done cleaning I&#8217;ll think, 
&#8220;Why am I wearing a hat in the house?&#8221;
And then I&#8217;ll remember and go do the thing before taking off the hat.
</p>
<p>
  The trick is
  <em>
    noticing
  </em>
  myself in the act of planning-to-remember. 
If you happen to say out loud, &#8220;oh, hey, remember to X&#8221; then it&#8217;s easy. 
I&#8217;ve trained myself to immediately be like &#8220;I will absolutely NOT remember to X&#8221;. 
But sometimes it&#8217;s a bit subconscious/unverbalized, like with planning to ledger the dishes when I&#8217;m done.
</p>
<p>
  So it&#8217;s not foolproof
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"YET1\\"

  </a>
  but it&#8217;s progress.
We&#8217;ll conclude with a whole list of examples, including from the wonderful subscribers to the daily beemail, for inspiration
(starting with the ones mentioned above for completeness):

    Stick a pencil behind your ear

  (Pro tip: Don&#8217;t undo any of those before actually doing the thing you needed to remember to do!
It&#8217;s tempting to think &#8220;I&#8217;m about to do it now so I can take this annoying thing off my face&#8221;.
But that&#8217;s planning-to-remember all over again!)
</p>
<p>
  So there you have it.
It&#8217;s taken conscious practice but now in our house whenever we hear each other say something like &#8220;remember to&#8230;&#8221; we tend to respond with &#8220;got a plan to forget?&#8221; and we make one and then we don&#8217;t. 
Forget, I mean. 
It&#8217;s great.

  to get this blog post started by telling you what we&#8217;ve been working on this last year (revamped reminders! so many new integrations! new versions of smartphone apps! meetups and Quantified Self!),
  <em>
    buuut
  </em>
  you&#8217;re probably more interested in the question of whether we owe someone $810, or if we came through on the progress we promised exactly a year ago. 
So let&#8217;s just get this out of the way: We&#8217;re paying up.
</p>
<p>
  But now we&#8217;re gonna make you stick with us through the rest of the post to hear all the juicy details.
</p>
<h2>
  Flashback to a year ago&#8230;
</h2>
<p>
  Shortly before our
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/three\\"
    title=\\"Last year&#39;s anniversary post\\"
  >
    third anniversary
  </a>
  we put ourselves on the hook for some big new features and scrambled to deploy them in time and made things kind of awful and broken for a while. 
We got

    href=\\"http://forum.beeminder.com/t/meta-feature-request-dont-put-yourself-on-the-hook-for-any-more-big-features/198\\"
    title=\\"Forum thread discussing how we shouldn&#39;t&#39;ve done what we did leading up to last year&#39;s anniversary post\\"

    scolded by our fans
  </a>
  .
Then we
  <a
    href=\\"http://forum.beeminder.com/t/meta-feature-request-dont-put-yourself-on-the-hook-for-any-more-big-features/198/3?u=dreev\\"
    title=\\"Same forum thread a few posts down\\"
  >
    brainstormed a bunch of ways
  </a>
  to mitigate that problem in the future (among them being &#8220;just cough up the money&#8221;, which we&#8217;re doing this time around!).
We also started using the strategy of beeminding the amount of time spent on each feature, which felt like a really useful way to
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/hardsoon\\"
    title=\\"Last week&#39;s post on hard-committing to do something “soon”\\"
  >
    guarantee progress without a hard deadline
  </a>
  . 
I&#8217;ve been using a Beeminder goal to spend half of my working time on the &#8220;next most important thing&#8221;, which keeps me moving forward, and turns most days into mini deadlines for the feature, without pushing me up against a wall where I feel pressured to deploy things in a half-baked state.
</p>
<p>
  Unfortunately, before we had that great discussion with you all, we already
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/three\\"
    title=\\"Last year&#39;s anniversary post -- scroll to the bottom for the promise\\"
  >
    committed $810
  </a>
  to finishing the following three things by this time:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>
      A dramatic improvement to new user experience, along the lines of a new user walkthrough (like HabitRPG does!) or changes to goal creation (with data that backs it up as better)
    </li>
    <li>
      Client-side graphs (panning and zooming and mousing over datapoints!)
    </li>
    <li>
      Revamped reminder and notification settings
    </li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>
<h2>
  How&#8217;d we do?
</h2>
<h3>
  1. Dramatic improvement to the new user experience
</h3>
<p>
  We tried out a widget from our friends at
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.useronboard.com/\\"
    title=\\"We highly recommend their teardowns!\\"
  >
    UserOnboard
  </a>
  , 
which gives a series of next steps for a newly minted user. 
Sadly, in its current form, it has no significant effect at all on goals created or datapoints added or credit cards added.
So not only is it not dramatic, but it&#8217;s not actually an improvement at all in its current state.
</p>
<p>
  Things we could try include tweaking the content and wording as well as the look and placement.
Other things to consider might be that this kind of guidance would be more helpful in a course of lifecycle emails, since the widget only helps once the user&#8217;s already signed in to their Beeminder account, and we may be losing people even before they get that far.
</p>
<h3>
  2. Interactive Graphs
</h3>
<p>
  We&#8217;ve got a beta version of this deployed for people who subscribe to
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/glossary/#beemail\\"
    title=\\"That&#39;s right, a glossary link, beetches\\"
  >
    daily beemails
  </a>
  (you can sign up too!).
The graphs are still generated by Matplotlib, but then rendered in your browser using D3. 
This current version does do panning and zooming, but it is
  <em>
    ugly
  </em>
  , and there is a ton of work to do on the details still, so we are far from being ready to deploy it as a replacement for the static graph images. 
Judge for yourself:

  3. Revamped reminders
</h3>
<p>
  We

    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/reminders\\"
    title=\\"The big announcement on the blog\\"

    rocked this one

Reminders are much simpler yet more flexible, and with much saner and less spammy defaults. 
And you can customize the defaults for new goals. Winning.

      New versions of smartphone apps. 
We published a long awaited update to the iOS app in July, which fixed a bunch of problems with app syncing and silent failure of datapoint submission. 
(Another update is around the corner.)

Setting down the rose-colored glasses for a second, we&#8217;re doing fine on the &#8220;to the right&#8221; part but it&#8217;s more like &#8220;to the right and at least definitely not down&#8221;.
In other words, revenue is still almost flat, not quite breaking $20k/month.
As much as we love working on Beeminder, that&#8217;s still less than we&#8217;d make with day jobs so that absolutely has to go up by next year.
Ok, putting the rose-colored glasses back on, we seem to be tentatively crushing our archnemesis,

<h2>
  So&#8230; what about that $810?
</h2>
<p>
  The client side graphing plus the new user experience both feel super weasely to try to count, though we made nice progress on each.
We had a whole year!
But we got really absorbed in all the new autodata integrations, and then the reminders revamp took much longer than expected. 
This next year we&#8217;ll take our own oft-repeated advice and commit to the inputs, not the outputs!
</p>
<p>
  So we&#8217;re paying out the $810 evenly amongst 8 of you. 
We&#8217;ll pay the first 4 commenters on this post, and then we&#8217;ll select 4 more users at random to spread the love around.
</p>
<h2>
  What about next year?
</h2>
<p>
  We&#8217;re both going to keep 50% of our Beeminder time (tracked by TagTime), turned toward the Next Most Important Thing.
If we derail on those goals, the pledges will get paid to one of you, same as for our personal meta goals, and the UVI, Infra, and Blog goals as well.

<p>
  Here&#8217;s what we mean by fractional beeminding:
If your metric for your Beeminder graph is a big chunky thing &#8212; say, number of blog posts &#8212; you can set your graph&#8217;s
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/integers/\\"
    title=\\"Integery Goals, Timey-Wimey Goals, and Conservarounding\\"
  >
    precision (number of decimal places)
  </a>
  to show values like 0.05 and then report to Beeminder whatever fraction of your next blog post you feel you&#8217;ve done.
</p>
<p>
  Wait, whatever fraction you &#8220;feel&#8221; you&#8217;ve done?
Have we lost our (bee)minds? 
Don&#8217;t we sing the praises of bright lines and objective metrics from morning to night around here?
</p>
<p>
  Yes but!
</p>
<p>
  I absolutely scoffed at this idea when I first heard it. 
It sounds like such a slippery slope.
Without objective criteria for the fractional amounts you&#8217;re logging, you&#8217;d gradually get weasellier and weasellier until you were entering a 0.99 for 30 seconds of work, right?
</p>
<p>
  Well, I no longer think that!
Or, rather, even if you slid down that slope with abandon, you&#8217;d run into a wall that makes it no worse than normal non-fractional beeminding, where you only enter a &#8220;1&#8221; for actually publishing the blog post or whatever.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;You can&#8217;t get to the next integer without finishing the Thing&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  Here&#8217;s how it might play out.
Say your graph shows 42.75 blog posts published, because you&#8217;ve published 42 and are deluding yourself that you&#8217;re 75% done with the upcoming one.
Now say it&#8217;s a
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/glossary/#beemergency\\"
    title=\\"A day when your datapoint  --  which will show up red  --  has crossed the bright red line but you haven’t officially derailed. You must get back to the good side of the line (go running, weigh in again, whatever you’ve committed to) by midnight at the end of this day. (And if you don’t like the default midnight deadline, you can change it.)\\"
  >
    beemergency
  </a>
  and the bare minimum that Beeminder is demanding is 0.1 blog posts, for a total of 42.85.
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"TOGGLETIP1\\"
    href=\\"#TOGGLETIP\\"
  >
    [1]
  </a>
  You open the draft, stare at it for a stupid amount of time, add a comma somewhere, and convince yourself that it&#8217;s totally 95% done now.
So you tell Beeminder &#8220;+0.2&#8221; and forget about it till Beeminder yells at you again in a couple days.
When Beeminder next yells at you, it&#8217;s saying you&#8217;re at 42.95 and need +0.1 again for a total of 43.05.
</p>
<p>
  Now the squishy delusional weaselliness is over.
You absolutely can&#8217;t tell Beeminder you&#8217;ve written 43-point-something blog posts unless exactly 43 blog posts are actually published.
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"ACCOUNTABILITY1\\"
    href=\\"#ACCOUNTABILITY\\"
  >
    [2]
  </a>
  So today&#8217;s beemergency is to actually publish that draft, plus make some token progress &#8212; what you&#8217;ll call 5% ha ha &#8212; on the next blog post.
</p>
<p>
  The key is the hard rule that you can&#8217;t get to the next integer without finishing the Thing. 
So you get some extra nudges with the fractional entries but you still have to hew to the overall rate.
The graph can only ever be wrong by less than one unit.
In the weaselly extreme it may say &#8220;42.99&#8221; when reality is more like &#8220;42.01&#8221; but it can&#8217;t be any worse than that.
</p>
<p>
  The math of the bright red line says that if you&#8217;re maximally weaselly about it then allowing fractional datapoints is equivalent to having started with one more day of initial flat spot than you really did.
I think the biggest reason you might reject this idea (other than your metric already being plenty granular) is that, even though it&#8217;s not a slippery slope you can slide down very
  <em>
    far
  </em>
  , the whole thing could easily become kind of pointless. 
Unless you can keep yourself honest with &#8220;I&#8217;m entering a 0.1 because I truly estimate I did 10% of the Thing&#8221;.

  Pro-tip: Click the amount due above the graph to toggle between the delta due and the total due.
(And thanks to William Ehlhardt for pointing out that this wanted mentioning.)
The fact that no one knows about that toggling &#8212; not even William, who resorted to finding the total in the Statistics tab, which also works &#8212; is basically a bug for us to fix.
In the meantime, if you&#8217;re scouring footnotes for obscure Beeminder features, you&#8217;ll probably like our list of

  Why couldn&#8217;t you?
Because then your graph would be verifiably false.
Which brings me to another pro-tip: Show off your graph to friends and family for extra accountability.
If you&#8217;re actually beeminding blog posts, put your graph in the sidebar of your blog (like we do!).
The point is that &#8220;how complete your draft is&#8221; is subjective but &#8220;draft &rarr; done&#8221; isn&#8217;t.

  [UPDATE 2016-03-25: This whole post is completely obsolete!
That&#8217;s a wonderful thing. We made everything simpler and better.
In short, all goals can now start at $0 pledged and there&#8217;s no need for a concept of freebees at all.
So don&#8217;t read on except out of historical interest!]
</p>
<p>
  <br>

  <br>

<p>
  So many changes lately to freebees and adding pledges to goals!
First, for those who haven&#8217;t read our
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/glossary\\"
    title=\\"We&#39;re serious, Beeminder has a whole freaking glossary. In fact, we&#39;re so serious it&#39;s kind of written to be read cover to cover.\\"

  cover to cover, a freebee is a goal with an initial
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/glossary#pledge\\"
    title=\\"Another link to the glossary. Short version is that pledges are the amount of money you commit to paying if you derail. For &#39;derail&#39; see the next link...\\"

  of $0.
Which means the first

    title=\\"Derailing means failing to keep all your datapoints on track toward your goal\\"

  </a>
  You get a few such goals that you can use before ever giving Beeminder your credit card.
If you derail, the graph freezes and you can&#8217;t continue with that goal until you put your money where your mouth is and agree to be charged $5 if you derail again. 
(If you never do go off track again you never actually pay anything.)
</p>
<h2>
  Creating Goals (Using Up Freebees)
</h2>
<p>
  The point of freebees is to let you get hooked on beeminding before having to enter a credit card.
But we&#8217;ve found that veteran Beeminder users often have a lot of value for freebees because it lowers the activation energy for creating new goals.
If that&#8217;s you, jump to &#8220;Buying More Freebees&#8221; below!
</p>
<p>
  The way things used to be, you started with 7 freebees.
When you created a goal you used a freebee but you got it back if you added a pledge to the goal. 
You, confusingly, did not get a freebee back if you deleted the goal &#8212; often exactly when people expected it, since deleted goals tend to be errors in setting things up. 
In practice no one could predict whether they had freebees remaining and it was a surprise each time whether Beeminder would tell you 
&#8220;you&#8217;re out of freebees so you have to create this goal with a pledge&#8221;.
</p>
<p>
  So for starters we now actually tell you how many freebees you have left in the sidebar!
And it no longer matters if you add a pledge, it still counts as one of your freebees each time you create a goal. 
But you do get a freebee back if you delete a goal.
</p>
<h2>
  Deleting Goals (Getting Back Freebees)
</h2>
<p>
  Beeminder being all about getting yourself firmly on the hook, you normally can&#8217;t just delete goals.
You can archive them, and it takes a week to take effect, during which time you&#8217;re still on the hook.
For newly created goals (less than a week old) we figure there are plenty of legitimate reasons to completely and instantaneously delete them.
So you&#8217;ll see a big red Delete button on new goals.
And if you&#8217;re deleting it for technical reasons (or straight up confusion) we give you a freebee back:
</p>
<p>
  <img
    class=\\"aligncenter\\"
    alt=\\"example of the goal deletion dialog\\"
    title=\\"A picture is worth a thousand words, or in this case a hundred words, since this is literally a picture of about 100 words\\"
    src=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/delete-dialog.png\\"
  >
</p>
<p>
  If you fill out the text box about why you&#8217;re deleting the goal it also sends us an email, and that has been a wonderful source of feedback about what&#8217;s confusing or where newbees are getting stuck.

  </a>
</p>
<h2>
  Entering Your Credit Card
</h2>
<p>
  When you first add a credit card we prompt you to archive any goals that you&#8217;re not serious about.
We cut back massively on the wall of text that accompanied adding a pledge to a goal, a vestige of our transition to our
&#8220;
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/nwo\\"

  >
    New World Order
  </a>
  &#8221; a year ago.
Hopefully it&#8217;s now made clear that you&#8217;re on the hook for all of your active goals as soon as we have your credit card.

  </a>
</p>
<p>
  Relatedly, we also scrapped the &#8220;add a pledge&#8221; vs &#8220;commit later&#8221; step in goal creation. 
You can push the up-arrow to $5 on any $0 goal to bump it up once you&#8217;ve added a credit card.
</p>
<h2>
  Buying More Freebees
</h2>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;Freebees lower the activation energy for creating new goals&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  In the course of implementing the above changes, and talking to you all about them, we discovered that there&#8217;s a faction of hardcore beeminders who are really attached to freebees. 
It&#8217;s not that you&#8217;re unwilling to pledge on goals, or ever pay for anything on the internet, it&#8217;s just that you want to be able to create new goals when fancy strikes without deciding immediately if it&#8217;s worth committing with actual money.
Yes, you could dial the yellow brick road sufficiently conservatively, but then you lose the guidance of the road.
</p>
<p>
  So for you we added the option to buy 10 freebees for $1 at any time. 
At 10 cents per freebee, it hopefully shouldn&#8217;t trigger hesitation in even the most frugal amongst you.
</p>
<p>
  To do this you have to enter a credit card, of course, which puts you on the hook for all your goals. 
That&#8217;s the other reason for this, and the reason you can buy freebees for peanuts.
We want to give you more excuses to enter your credit card, because you&#8217;re not really beeminding until you do!

  We&#8217;re actually contemplating changing the name &#8220;freebee&#8221; since it&#8217;s all wrong in various ways.
Freebies generally refer to cheap giveaways, and, more importantly, the name might lead you to believe you&#8217;d never have to pay anything for a goal created as a freebee.
We just need something more concise than &#8220;goal with no money at stake for the first derailment&#8221;.
The best candidate so far is the boring &#8220;Free Start Goal&#8221;.
</p>
<p>
  There&#8217;s also potential confusion with our

  Please do keep filling out that form when you delete goals!
Users often don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s worth our time to read feedback like that because they think the problem was their own fault.
And in isolation it may seem that way.
But when we see lots of feedback, patterns emerge and it becomes clear what we need to change to make the problem go away, regardless of fault.
(Which is to say, it&#8217;s usually our fault!)

  You&#8217;re probably here because you either know and love Beeminder, or you&#8217;re a fan of freeCodeCamp.
In case it&#8217;s the latter, we&#8217;ll start with a quick explanation of what Beeminder&#8217;s all about.

  What&#8217;s special about Beeminder is that we combine Quantified Self &#8212; i.e., self-tracking data collection and visualization &#8212; with commitment contracts.
If you don&#8217;t know anything about commitment contracts, it works like this with Beeminder:
We plot your progress on a graph and represent your commitment as a literal bright red line.
If you cross that line, we charge you money.
Long-time Beeminder users find that those stings (get it?) are well worth it for all the awesomeness we induce the rest of the time.
But if the thought of having to pay money is too scary, that&#8217;s perfect: 
you&#8217;ll be very motivated to keep all your datapoints above the red line.

</p>
<p>
  You write code to solve problems, right in the browser, hit control-enter, and hear a chime and get a point if your solution works.
It&#8217;s very satisfying, not to mention edifying!
</p>
<p>
  When you connect that to Beeminder, you get a graph like this:

<p>
  Nicky has 4 days to earn their next 10 points on freeCodeCamp or they&#8217;re going to owe Beeminder $5!
</p>
<h3>
  Getting Started
</h3>
<p>
  Here&#8217;s how to get one of those of your very own.
</p>
<p>
  Sign up for both Beeminder and freeCodeCamp, of course.
Note your freeCodeCamp username.
(Also you&#8217;ll need to make your profile and points public in your
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/settings\\"
    title=\\"You probably wanted to be showing off your points anyway, right?\\"
  >
    freeCodeCamp settings
  </a>
  so Beeminder can see them.)
Then click &#8220;New Goal&#8221; on Beeminder (or go to
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/new\\"
    title=\\"Or bmndr.co/new for short\\"
  >
    beeminder.com/new
  </a>
  ) and click the freeCodeCamp logo.
That brings you to a screen like this:

    src=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/fcc-setup-screenshot.png\\"
  >
</p>
<p>
  Fill that in and you&#8217;re off to the races.
You&#8217;ll never have to do anything on Beeminder.
Just go earn more freeCodeCamp points when Beeminder yells at you!

  The previous post ended with a small blurb about how Danny&#8217;s idea of freshening a backlog isn&#8217;t just useful for programmers&#8230;
leaving the floor wide-open for me to come in with my freshening experiment! 
I say &#8220;experiment&#8221; but, even though I&#8217;m not done with my first passes through the relevant backlogs, the process is definitely here to stay.

    a whole set of help docs
  </a>

(If this is complete news to you, then

We need to know when we&#8217;ve buried something important.)
</p>
<p>
  We also have a set of behind-the-scenes docs, which tell new workerbees (or forgetful ones) exactly what we need to do when X or Y circumstance comes up.
</p>
<p>
  The problem with documentation is that it&#8217;s really easy for it to get out of date &#8212; especially when you

  once a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year, 3650 days a decade&#8230;
It may not seem like a big deal when it&#8217;s just a tiny tweak in copy.
People would totally know that the &#8220;Ratchet!&#8221; button is the same as the &#8220;Ratchet&#8221; button but with more enthusiasm.
The problem is that the slow drift is insidious, and before you know it, none of the words on the page match anymore! 
And fixing it all up becomes a never-ending task: I look at the task of &#8220;updating the Help Docs&#8221; with a bit of a sense of despair. 
I know it all needs work, but I don&#8217;t know where to

  .
</p>
<p>
  Or I
  <em>
    didn&#8217;t

  &#8212; and now I do. 
Once Danny started everyone off with the idea of freshening the open Github issue backlog, I decided to apply the same to the Help Docs 
(and the internal support documentation as well). 
Alongside big edits like adding in new articles for new integrations, or adjusting all the mentions of the word

  </a>
  , every day I look for the oldest unedited Help Doc and the oldest unedited support document, and I do something that improves them.
</p>
<p>
  At the moment, I&#8217;m on my first pass with both. 
Because the process of ascertaining which one was the oldest took up so much time, I actually simplified it: 
for my first time through the whole backlog, I&#8217;d just go in the order they&#8217;re listed. 
In the future, I can just follow that order: that will automatically be (more or less) the right one. 
(There will be exceptions where a single document here or there has been edited more recently, but it could probably do with other edits anyway if it was just edited to match a recent change, rather than with an eye to improving it overall.)
</p>
<p>
  And how&#8217;s it going? 
Well, at the time of writing, I&#8217;ve edited about 80 of each, producing
  <a
    href=\\"https://beeminder.com/changelog\\"
    title=\\"Search &#39;help docs&#39; or &#39;help page&#39; or &#39;help article&#39;\\"
  >
    about 50 UVIs
  </a>
  . 
The improvements I&#8217;ve made aren&#8217;t all huge: sometimes it&#8217;s just a word or two. 
Sometimes it&#8217;s important stuff for accessibility, like adding alt text to images where it was completely lacking before. 
Sometimes it&#8217;s pretty big, and involves me poking around trying to find out if certain things have changed, or whether things work the way I think they do.

    My freshdocs goal. The one for our internal documentation looks very similar.

<p>
  It&#8217;s not always easy, and personally I do encourage some flexibility &#8212; if something is going to take you a couple of days to properly attend to, then do another, easier document first, to give yourself the time to do a proper job on the bigger edits. 
You can&#8217;t slack on making the big updates, either, no matter how tempting it is to wait until the document comes up for freshening.
</p>
<p>
  Don&#8217;t skimp when you
  <em>
    know
  </em>
  something needs fixing, either: 
you can&#8217;t just wait for the backlog freshening to make you get round to it. 
Freshening helps you get to the stuff that didn&#8217;t seem important to change at the time, and is no replacement for fixing something that suddenly becomes egregiously wrong. 
It helps you get to the stuff that you didn&#8217;t know about yet.
</p>
<p>
  What happens once your help documentation is absolutely perfect? 
Well, the good news is, that will never happen for something that documents a site in active development. 
I totally expect to get to a point where
  <em>
    some
  </em>
  of the docs don&#8217;t need anything
  <em>
    obvious
  </em>
  tweaked, though. 
In that case, I&#8217;ll close-read them, be nitpicky about the copy for absolute clarity, ensure they have the right keywords, and then call it a day. 
I&#8217;m pretty doubtful that there&#8217;ll ever be a document that has not even a comma out of place.

  >
    control systems approach to backlogs
  </a>
  . 
Quick recap: make a manual do-more goal where you add a +1 for completing something and keep adjusting the slope of the bright red line such that the backlog keeps steadily shrinking.
This works not just for clearing a backlog but for winning the
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/redqueen\\"
    title=\\"Redqueening, Inbox Zero, Backlogs, and Fluid Dynamics\\"
  >
    red queen race
  </a>
  &#8212; dispatching things at roughly the rate they&#8217;re coming in at and preventing another backlog from accumulating.
</p>
<p>
  Which is great for clearing and preventing backlogs but there are some backlogs that you never expect to clear.
Beeminder has 630 bug reports and feature requests and other open issues in our issue tracker.
We call them
  <em>
    gissues
  </em>
  .
For GitHub Issues, that being where they live.
(A more common term is &#8220;tickets&#8221;.)
We generate these gissues by the day.
And we dispatch them by the day too, but it&#8217;s like a hydra.
New ones appear slightly faster than we slay them.
That&#8217;s fine and normal for actively developed software.
(Regressions &#8212; zombies as we call them &#8212; are another story; we talked about those last time as an example of a backlog we very much have to clear and prevent from recurring.)
But we also can&#8217;t let our bug database just be a black hole.
</p>
<p>
  What to do?
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;I think of it as doing spaced repetition on our collection of open Beeminder issues&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  The answer is freshening.
You keep touching whatever the oldest item is so nothing goes totally out of sight, out of mind.
What does &#8220;touching&#8221; mean?
Here are our rules:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    More copyediting of the top-level description as you re-reflect on the gissue.
  </li>
  <li>
    Optimize the title for getting you to recall what the gissue is about.
  </li>
  <li>
    Are the labels good?
  </li>
  <li>
    Often you think of new keywords or related gissues to link to, based on other freshening.
  </li>
  <li>
    Split the action items into finer-grained tasks.
  </li>
  <li>
    Check one of them off or otherwise make some quantum of progress and mention what you did as a gissue comment.
  </li>
  <li>
    There&#8217;s always snoozing it
    <a
      class=\\"footnote\\"
      id=\\"SNOOZE1\\"
      href=\\"#SNOOZE\\"
    >
      [1]
    </a>
    if no freshening makes sense and it&#8217;s not a priority and is ok to go out of sight out of mind until we go looking for it.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you&#8217;ve exhausted the previous 7 things and are still agonizing, identify a pre-req gissue. Say you need to freshen gissue G and you&#8217;ve found gissue H that should happen first. Edit H to include &#8220;unsnooze G&#8221; as a checklist item, then snooze G.
  </li>
  <li>
    Whine to Danny
    <a

    </a>
    who can probably do one of the above things for you.
  </li>
  <li>
    If even that fails it probably means it&#8217;s time for the gissue to actually be the next priority!
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  The point is to keep curating and improving the items in the backlog.
It helps immensely with keeping everything at your fingertips.
Before I started doing this, we&#8217;d constantly be creating gissues that turned out to be duplicates of ancient existing ones.
Now that rarely happens.
I think of it as doing
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/habits/\\"
    title=\\"Failing your Goals with Beeminder -- guest post by Paul Fenwick, largely about Anki\\"
  >
    spaced repetition
  </a>
  on our collection of open Beeminder issues.
</p>
<p>
  Which brings me to the question of spacing and timing and actually beeminding this.
First, decide how many days stale you want to let the stalest item in your collection get.
We aim for 90 days. 
And we have 443 open, non-snoozed
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"SNOOZE2\\"
    href=\\"#SNOOZE\\"
  >
    [1]
  </a>
  gissues.
Since 443/90 is about 5, I have my gissue-freshening goal dialed to 5 freshenings (aka epsilon improvements) per day.
</p>
<a href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/d/freshgish\\">

    src=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/freshgish-screenshot.png\\"
  >
</a>
<p>
  I just sort the gissues by age, freshen the oldest 5, and enter a +5 on that Beeminder goal.
Hewing to the bright red line means I&#8217;ll keep cycling through the gissues roughly every 90 days.
</p>
<h3>
  Not just for programmers
</h3>
<p>
  I&#8217;ve focused on Beeminder&#8217;s main bug database as the prime example but we&#8217;ve been liking this enough to (blog about it for one, and to) start applying it to other things, including in our personal lives.
Most recently, Bee and I have created &#8220;rolodex&#8221; Beeminder goals: 
we&#8217;re gradually adding friends, family, and colleagues to a database and then freshening a contact means, well, contacting them.
We&#8217;re also applying exactly the above gissue freshening protocol to multiple other GitHub repositories, like the GitHub repository for our household/relationship as well as
  <a
    href=\\"https://github.com/beeminder/road\\"
    title=\\"We intend to change the name of this to Beebrain but for now it&#39;s called &#39;road&#39;, for historical reasons\\"
  >
    Beebrain and the dynamic graph editor
  </a>
  .
We think it&#8217;s pretty powerful.
For backlogs you have to clear and keep at bay, set up a
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/control/\\"
    title=\\"A control system is just a feedback loop. You dial your bright red line steeper in order to more quickly reduce the size of the backlog you&#39;re beeminding.

  >
    control system goal
  </a>
  . 
For backlogs that are more like a permanent, curated, perhaps ever-growing collection, a freshening goal is our recommendation.

  Snoozing means putting a gissue in an intermediate state between closed and open.
It&#8217;s technically open but with a
  <code>
    ZzZ
  </code>
  label that means it&#8217;s exempt from gissue freshening.
In other words, it&#8217;s ok to go out of sight, out of mind.

</p>
<p>
  I&#8217;m including the whole transcript below after the embedded video but the real heart of it is captured in a few slides which I&#8217;ll reproduce here in text for better future searchability.
First is a list of forms of friction (thanks to
  <a
    href=\\"http://aaronparecki.com\\"
    title=\\"Beeminder advisor and superfan!\\"
  >
    Aaron Parecki
  </a>
  for first defining this notion of frictionlessness for self-tracking):
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Entering data
  </li>
  <li>
    Charging a device
  </li>
  <li>
    Syncing
  </li>
  <li>
    Taking devices on and off (e.g., if not waterproof)
  </li>
  <li>
    General usability
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Mostly I&#8217;m focused on the first item in that list, entering data.
(The other items are why I like, for example, my Misfit Shine for step counting.)
Which is to say automatically tracking data.
Here&#8217;s a list of metrics that can be automatically tracked and sent to Beeminder along with the gadgets or services you need to do so:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Steps, sleep (Fitbit, Misfit, Garmin)
  </li>
  <li>
    Weight (Withings, Fitbit Aria)
  </li>
  <li>
    Time spent (RescueTime)
  </li>
  <li>
    Todos done (Habitica, Trello, Todoist et al via IFTTT)
  </li>
  <li>
    Number of workouts (IFTTT location)
  </li>
  <li>
    Tweets
  </li>
  <li>
    Emails archived (GmailZero)
  </li>
  <li>
    Points on Duolingo
  </li>
  <li>
    Blog posts posted (RSS via IFTTT)
  </li>
  <li>
    Phone calls placed (IFTTT or Tasker)
  </li>
  <li>
    Files in a Dropbox folder (via IFTTT)
  </li>
  <li>
    Pocket articles read/queued (IFTTT)
  </li>
  <li>
    Words written/edited (Draft integration)
  </li>
  <li>
    Time spent learning (Skritter)
  </li>
  <li>
    Points earned on Code School
  </li>
  <li>
    GitHub commits or issues closed
  </li>
  <li>
    Instagram photos posted (via IFTTT)
  </li>
  <li>
    Reddit posts (IFTTT again)
  </li>
  <li>
    Toggl entries (Zapier)
  </li>
  <li>
    Bitbucket commits (Zapier)
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  And for good measure, here are some semi-automatable metrics:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Pushups (via touching nose to screen)
  </li>
  <li>
    Time via Timer in Beeminder Android app
  </li>
  <li>
    Steps/sleep via gadgets that require frequent charging
  </li>
  <li>
    IFTTT’s “Do Button” (Trigger is pushing a button on your phone’s homescreen)
  </li>
  <li>
    TagTime (also by Team Beeminder)
  </li>
  <li>
    Tracking by Reply to Beeminder Bot w/ data
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Clearly a lot of options for frictionless tracking (and beeminding!) and the possibilities are exploding.
This is a big part of the Internet Of Things.
It&#8217;s also about to get cheap and easy to have sensors on everything.
One I&#8217;m particularly excited about on the horizon is the

  Hi, I&#8217;m Daniel Reeves, cofounder of Beeminder, here to talk about Frictionless Tracking with Beeminder Autodata. 
Beeminder is Quantified Self plus commitment contracts, or data-oriented behavior change. 
So we&#8217;re all about leveraging your QS data to impose discipline on yourself. 
But mustering the discipline to enter data can be a catch 22. 
Which is why we love ways to automatically collect data about oneself, and Beeminder has ways to help with that.
</p>
<p>
  I know some of you have no interest in the commitment device aspect of Beeminder. 
It&#8217;s not for everyone. 
But this is of more general interest, at least for a Quantified Self audience, whether or not you&#8217;re into artificially imposed discipline.
</p>
<p>
  Here&#8217;s the collection of Quantified Self apps and services and gadgets that Beeminder currently integrates with, the most recent being Skritter, for learning Chinese and Japanese.
</p>
<p>
  <img
    class=\\"aligncenter\\"
    alt=\\"Autodata collage\\"
    title=\\"Autodata collage -- we need to add Complice to this even though technically it's still a 3rd-party integration. Also HabitRPG is now Habitica.\\"
    src=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/autodata-collage.png\\"
  >
</p>
<p>
  We&#8217;re proud to say this list has tripled since the previous QS conference. 
We&#8217;ve been pushing hard to make Beeminder integrate with as much of the Quantified Self world as possible.
</p>
<p>
  In fact, we made a quantum leap in that regard when we recently added Zapier and IFTTT Channels. 
Now those platforms are doing much of the work for us. 
Every time another QS tool gets on the IFTTT or Zapier trains, that&#8217;s one more automatic source of data that can be fed to Beeminder.
</p>
<p>
  For anyone who doesn&#8217;t know about IFTTT and Zapier, IFTTT stands for &#8220;If This Then That&#8221;. 
It&#8217;s a service that lets you connect two different web services or apps together using Recipes of the form &#8220;if this happens&#8221; then &#8220;do that&#8221;. 
You pick a Trigger &#8212; new instragram photo, rain forecast, you name it &#8212; and IFTTT will do some specified Action whenever the triggering event happens.
</p>
<p>
  Zapier is the same idea but is more nerd focused, giving you more control over the recipes you set up and is a little less friendly for non-technical users. 
It also tends to focus on startups as its target demographic, meaning it has lots of channels for productivity tools like to-do lists and time trackers. 
It&#8217;s freemium and if you use it very heavily you&#8217;ll probably want to pony up for a premium plan. 
IFTTT, on the other hand, is totally free, and really impressive in its simplicity and slickness. 
Both are powerful tools for automating data collection about yourself.
</p>
<p>
  Back to Beeminder, the goal is to eliminate the step of actually entering data. 
Going to a website to enter data is a pain. 
We have smartphone apps, which may help. 
In some cases replying to our email bot with data can remove most of the friction. 
But truly frictionless self-quantifying means you just do the thing you want to measure and never give a single thought to the actual measuring.
</p>
<p>
  Maybe you wear a Fitbit or a Misfit or a Garmin Vivofit or a Jawbone UP. 
If you connect any of those to Beeminder, letting Beeminder read the data that those gadgets are collecting, then Beeminder will automatically make a graph for you showing your cumulative number of steps or hours of sleep.
</p>
<p>
  Whenever you&#8217;re in danger of going off track, meaning your average number of steps (or whatever you&#8217;re measuring) has fallen below the goal you set for yourself, Beeminder will warn you. 
If you don&#8217;t heed the warning, it charges your credit card (though we&#8217;re very friendly about it and you can easily cry foul, unless you
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/legit/\\"
    title=\\"Weasel-Proofing and the Definition of Legitimacy\\"
  >
    weaselproof yourself
  </a>
  , 
but that&#8217;s another story).
</p>
<p>
  We recommend automatability as the top criterion for
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/whattomind\\"
    title=\\"In case you&#39;re curious about the other criteria for beemindable metrics\\"
  >
    what metric to beemind
  </a>
  in the first place. 
Like maybe you have a goal of getting in better shape. 
Body weight isn&#8217;t the greatest metric for that, for a few reasons. 
But it is very easily automatable, thanks to Withings and Fitbit&#8217;s Aria scale, both of which we integrate with. 
You literally just stand on the scale and your graph is updated. 
And, especially if you&#8217;re well above your ideal weight, it&#8217;s a fine proxy for fitness.
</p>
<p>
  Or take gym workouts. 
Thanks to the iOS and Android location Channels on IFTTT, it&#8217;s dirt simple to set up a recipe to automatically send a +1 to Beeminder whenever you come within some radius of your gym. 
A personal favorite of mine is built in to the Beeminder Android app: 
I do pushups by putting my phone on the floor and touching my nose to it with every repetition. 
Beeminder counts the pushups that way and magically updates my graph.
</p>
<p>
  For productivity, we highly recommend RescueTime, which beautifully automates time tracking and integrates with Beeminder. 
We have a vaguely similar tool called TagTime that&#8217;s much less friendly and tries to hit the sweet spot between fully automatic tracking and manual time tracking. 
But since this is all about frictionless tracking, RescueTime is where it&#8217;s at.
</p>
<p>
  One more option for Android users is
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/beedroid/\\"
    title=\\"So powerful, and correspondingly confusing to set up\\"
  >
    our Tasker integration
  </a>
  . 
Tasker is like IF This Then That for your Android phone. 
You can set up Tasker tasks that trigger based on any conceivable event that your phone is aware of &#8212; the screen coming on, any app opening or closing, location, you name it &#8212; and cause data to be automatically sent to Beeminder, either directly, for counting events, or by starting and stopping a timer, though RescueTime is generally a simpler way to measure time spent.
</p>
<p>
  Finally I&#8217;ll quickly mention that Beeminder has an API so the sky is really the limit for automating feeding your Beeminder graphs. 
We also intend to keep adding more official integrations. 
So makers of other QS tools, please talk to us! 
As our current integration partners will attest, it&#8217;s a pretty nice feature to offer your users who may want to use your tool more than they do, if only they could construct a small kick in the pants to stay on the wagon.

<p>
  Having been a university student for some years now, I&#8217;ve come to appreciate just how important it is to spread out your studying over the whole semester. 
It&#8217;s the single most important aspect of good study technique. 
I&#8217;ll even go so far as to advocate the opposite extreme of the typical student&#8217;s modus operandi:
Go into exam crunch mode in the beginning and end softly, making sure to get plenty of sleep, exercise, and good food in the final days before the exam and spend that final time mostly working through earlier years&#8217; exams.
</p>
<h2>
  Standard Study Schedules
</h2>
<p>
  The first thing you&#8217;ve got to do as a student before any semester starts, is to get a good overview of your weekly schedule.
All lectures, classroom exercises, lab time, etc, should be written into some kind of schedule or calendar (I use Google Calendar).
Then write in your other commitments such as job, sports, etc &#8212; anything you do that is regular (use several colors for a good overview).
Finally, decide how many hours you must study each week to be successful &#8212; most universities have official guidelines on this.
For me it&#8217;s 45 hours per week including both the scheduled stuff and home reading.
My scheduled hours at the university totaled 22.5 hours, which left another 22.5 hours to study on my own each week.
But this was just my minimum, and I&#8217;ve found that 48-50 hours is a more fitting number for technical subjects like math, physics, and engineering.
Make sure you also note assignments and tests that will require an extra workload so you can anticipate busy weeks in advance and plan extra-curricular activity accordingly.
</p>
<p>
  So you distribute all these hours and set up a Standard Study Schedule, bearing in mind that that is all this is &#8212; a standard plan, a point of reference.

  &#8220;I figured my personal motivation and common sense were sufficient to learn&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  In my early college days I didn&#8217;t do this.
I figured my personal motivation and common sense were sufficient to learn. 
It worked for me in high-school after all. 
And it&#8217;s true that personal motivation to learn and excitement for the subject are the primary ingredients of educational success.
But I kept getting mixed results: I ended up way too busy in the fews weeks before the exam.
This should sound familiar to most students. 
I felt palpable progress once I started making Standard Study Schedules, writing all regular activities into my calendar and making clear to myself how much studying was needed at home, and approximately when I had time in my week for it.
</p>
<h2>
  Commitment Devices
</h2>
<p>
  In November 2011 I decided to add the final ingredient: a commitment device.
More specifically:
  <a href=\\"http://beeminder.com\\">
    Beeminder
  </a>
  .
Through all of 2011 I had begun to experiment with all kinds of tracking &#8212; my sleep, time spent on all daily activities, GPS tracking of my running, and recording every weight lifted at the gym.
I was exploring whether
  <a href=\\"http://quantifiedself.com\\">
    collecting data about my life
  </a>
  could transparently and objectively reveal my habits and time usage, hoping it could also help me change them. 
What I found attractive in Beeminder was that it was designed around the idea of reporting in every day, trying to stay near the ideal &#8220;yellow brick road&#8221;.
The yellow brick road allows for
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/roadwidth\\"
    title=\\"Previous Beeminder blog post about the nitty gritty of the width of the yellow brick road\\"
  >
    some variation
  </a>
  but at the same time requires you to

    title=\\"Previous Beeminder blog post about the nitty gritty of tracking goals for which you don&#39;t necessarily report every day\\"
  >
    stay true to your goal
    <em>
      every
    </em>
    day
  </a>
  !
This seemed a great way to counter my still-worst enemy, procrastination. 
Adding in a money contract so you lose $10 or [$30] if you fail is an ingenious way to kick the motivation up another notch.
</p>
<p>
  I set a very specific goal: 200 hours of study in November &#8212; 45.16 hours per week.
This included lectures, lab time, homework, everything.
Behold the result:
</p>

  </a>
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;Let Beeminder&#8217;s yellow brick road be your guide!&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  Looking at the data in retrospect I was surprised by the amount of variance day-to-day.
Even though the weekly average will typically come to around 45 hours, there are many days at 1-3 hours and at 9-12 hours of studying.
I knew that it varied from day to day, but the sheer amount of variance surprised me. 
While some of the variance resulted from procrastination and distractions, most of it is actually okay and totally natural; we&#8217;re human, not machines. 
What&#8217;s not okay is to have several lazy weeks of 2-3 hours per day on average, then a crunch in the final two weeks before the exam of 10-12 hours per day.
A short period of 2-3 hour days is fine, but even a single week of that will set you back too much in a typical semester. 
Unfortunately I did have a very late-nighter and a single all-nighter (note the big vertical jumps in the graph) which means I didn&#8217;t sail quite smooth enough.
But the point is: let Beeminder&#8217;s yellow brick road be your guide! 
You can work hard for a few days and earn a buffer-day for when you&#8217;re worn out! 
This also encourages better sleeping and eating to make the extended work periods liveable, perhaps even enjoyable.
</p>
<p>
  In the end the work has to get done. 
Your books, the examiners, and especially your future self don&#8217;t care what excuses you had for not doing the work. 
And all my experience tells me that the hardest part of studying (and in most matters) is taking the first step. 
It&#8217;s almost fictitious because it&#8217;s all up there in your head &#8212; that mental blockade of not wanting to begin work. 
The good news is that Beeminder solves that start-up problem elegantly. 
It tells you &#8220;just get going because you simply can&#8217;t afford NOT to do anything today&#8221;, and most often you keep on studying quite automatically thereafter. 
On other days I have no motivation issues, in which case Beeminder acts as a bank for my good conscience &#8212; the good work is converted into buffer time where I can relax or do other things.
</p>
<h2>
  Fine Print and OCD
</h2>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;No particular 30 minutes will make or break you so 199.5 is as good as 200&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  Racing towards finishing my first Beeminder goal I thought I was doing pretty well. 
But on the very last day I almost failed. 
The funny thing happened is that I didn&#8217;t meet my &#8220;200 study hours&#8221; goal for November, only
  <em>
    199.5
  </em>
  and the final half hour fell just on the other side of midnight!
(Note that the final dot is orange instead of blue.)
Had I failed? 
On the other hand I was still on the yellow brick road.
I wrote to the Beeminder creators, Daniel Reeves and Bethany Soule, with my question. 
Here is how Bethany answered:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    You fulfilled your Beeminder commitment [even though] you can&#8217;t say you did 200 hours! 
The numbers don&#8217;t lie &#8230; but the month was still a total success, right? 
200 is a nice, round, focal number to pick, but also completely arbitrary, and as far as academic success goes, there&#8217;s no particular 30 minutes that will make or break you, so 199.5 is literally as good as 200. 
Which is really what Beeminder is totally awesome at. 
It&#8217;s an incontrovertible record of what you actually accomplished, but it also allows for a little bit of leeway without degenerating into a fuzzy line that doesn&#8217;t have any sting.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Which was a good point for such a perfectionist, occasionally borderline OCD person such as myself. 
Without a tool like Beeminder it&#8217;s hard to tell that 199.5 is just as good as 200 hours.
</p>
<h2>
  Postscript
</h2>
<p>
  November was a great success and I&#8217;ve been using Beeminder on and off ever since.
I don&#8217;t use it for everything, just for a small, albeit important, class of things I want.
I have made no promise to use it regularly, but only when I feel motivated and it makes sense for me.
So far this has been almost every month, mostly for study time tracking. 
When I do use it, I&#8217;m making a clear and strong commitment to myself.

In December I promised to write about this, but nothing really happened until I committed to X amount of words/day through Beeminder in February.

<h3>
  Beeminder Reprise
</h3>
<p>
  You&#8217;re probably here because you either know and love Beeminder, or you&#8217;re using a Garmin vívo* device, or a Garmin Forerunner. 
Since this is Beeminder turf we&#8217;ll start with a quick explanation of what Beeminder&#8217;s all about. 
(For the full Beeminder story, you could start with
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/akrasia\\"
    title=\\"&#39;How To Do What You Want: Akrasia and Self-Binding&#39;\\"
  >
    our inaugural blog post
  </a>
  about akrasia and self-binding, a.k.a. commitment devices.)
</p>
<p>
  What&#8217;s special about Beeminder is that we combine Quantified Self &#8212; i.e., self-tracking data collection and visualization &#8212; with commitment contracts.
If you don&#8217;t know anything about commitment contracts, it works like this with Beeminder:
We plot your progress along a Yellow Brick Road to your goal and if you go off track, we charge you money.
Long-time Beeminder users find that those stings (get it?) are well worth it for all the awesomeness we induce the rest of the time.
But if the thought of having to pay money is too scary, that&#8217;s perfect: you&#8217;ll be very motivated to keep all your datapoints on your yellow brick road.
We don&#8217;t even ask for a credit card until the first time you go off track.
[UPDATE: No longer true!]
If you never do go off track, Beeminder is free forever.
[UPDATE: Still true unless you want a premium plan.]
</p>
<h3>
  Garmin
</h3>
<p>
  If you&#8217;re a Quantified Self nerd, which, reading this blog you probably are, then you&#8217;re probably already familiar with Garmin.
I personally have been wearing a Garmin vívofit for months now and absolutely love it.
In fact, it&#8217;s the first activity tracker I&#8217;ve worn consistently since I accidentally sent an early Fitbit through the wash 4 years ago.
The vívofit, by contrast, never needs charging (it uses a watch battery) and is waterproof.
Which means I simply wear it, let it automatically sync to Beeminder, and never otherwise have to think about it.
Also it tells time! Right on my wrist! Living in the future is grand.
</p>
<h3>
  Getting Started
</h3>
<p>
  So here&#8217;s how it works using your Garmin with Beeminder.
</p>
<p>
  If you use a Garmin Forerunner, then we can track your total time spent training, or we can track your total mileage. 
If you have a vívofit or any device in the Vivo-family, we can track either your total daily steps, or your total daily sleep. 
When you visit the

    title=\\"Huge thank you to our beta users who&#39;ve been using this for some weeks now and have been pointing out the glaring bugs. Let us know if they saved any for you!\\"
  >
    Garmin landing page
  </a>
  you&#8217;ll first authorize with Garmin so that we will be able to read your data, and get notified when you upload new data. 
Then you&#8217;ll select the type of Garmin device you use, and the type of goal you&#8217;d like to set up. 
Every time Garmin gets an update from your device, we get the new data from them. 
So the next time you go for a run or a ride or whatever, we&#8217;ll add it to your Beeminder graph for you. Voila.
Beeminder will send you reminders if you&#8217;re approaching the edge of your road, so if you haven&#8217;t been doing enough you&#8217;ll get notified.
And if you fall behind, we&#8217;ll charge you money.
</p>
<p>
  UPDATE: One caveat about sleep tracking: while Garmin auto-detects sleep on the vívofit bands, they only show it to us as sleep time if you actually put the device in sleep mode.
We haven&#8217;t figured out a way around this yet, so just keep that in mind if you want to beemind sleep with your Garmin.

  Does everyone know the soup nazi from Seinfeld? 
Basically it&#8217;s an interesting episode in

    Seinfeldnomics
  </a>
  (and boy howdy do we like economics) where there&#8217;s a soup stand that gets really popular, but the guy selling the soup fires customers if they don&#8217;t order correctly, and so Elaine and Jerry and the gang start referring to him as &#8220;the soup nazi&#8221;. 
Which I guess is funny because he&#8217;s refusing to do business with people who want to give him money?
But clearly his business is doing just-fine-thank-you.
And actually, well, he should clearly just hike the price on his soup until his supply meets the demand without him getting all stressed out and cranky at the customers.
But maybe he likes screaming at people? In which case maybe the status quo is just fine from his point of view.
</p>
<p>
  Anyway, I digress. 
We were talking recently about doing experiments on all of you. 
Like na[oops, no, we are being told in no uncertain terms that we cannot make this joke]!
 
In particular we were talking about the trade-off between expected value of any particular experiment and expected cost.
If something has a small chance of having a large effect, but it&#8217;s cheap and fast to do, then why not try it out?
</p>
<p>
  A couple years ago we tried out what would happen if we just killed the free plan &#8212; signing up meant coughing up for a premium subscription on day one.
Answer: signups plummeted. 
So we undid that. 
And it led us to concluding that

Learning things!
</p>
<p>
  We&#8217;re not exactly short on problems to solve, but the one that&#8217;s been perhaps most salient of late is improving our onboarding gulf.
We still get a lot of people who sign up for Beeminder but never get around to creating any goals at all.
We&#8217;ve got a nice list of Obvious Things To Try, like 
writing interactive tutorials, 
a series of onboarding emails that keeps re-prompting users through getting started, 
office hours, 
building goal creation into sign up, 
just overhauling goal creation in general, 
making clonable goals, 
etc etc. 
These are all
  <em>
    great
  </em>
  ideas. 
But they&#8217;re all pretty high cost to implement.

      We&#8217;ve internally been calling this Cantor&#8217;s Compromise:

        incentive-misalignment
      </a>
      and if the gateway drug commitment device ends up feeling aligned (haha) with that then maybe a meta-goal can be even more aligned. 
If done right, which is a huge if, then it can serve as an immediate intro to how Beeminder works, including showing the user that they&#8217;re free to hit archive if they don&#8217;t actually want the ongoing commitment to use Beeminder itself.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      We don&#8217;t want to force the user to do anything they don&#8217;t want to force themself to do. 
We want to hold the new prospective user&#8217;s hand and make sure we harness the burst of motivation that has them creating a Beeminder account. 
We want to make sure that indecision/procrastination/ADHD doesn&#8217;t snatch them back out of our claws. 
If we get them set up with a long-term goal for the thing they actually care about, perfect. 
If they&#8217;re so sold on Beeminder that they&#8217;re game to beemind their beeminding off the bat, also perfect. 
If they&#8217;re shilly-shallying then we should&#8230; make that very uncomfortable. 
Possibly to the point of saying you can&#8217;t actually create this Beeminder account without being on the hook in some way.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      We don&#8217;t know yet how that will play out, just that if we end up loving the gateway drug then maybe we&#8217;ll want to implement it in an even more beeminder-y way.

    <p>
    </p>
  </details>
</div>
<br>
<p>
  So then we came up with a crazier thing to try, that has a smaller chance of being a good idea, but is much simpler to implement than any of those things: 
Signing up for Beeminder is itself a commitment device.
</p>
<p>
  If you&#8217;re here, checking us out, you&#8217;re probably into the idea of a commitment device. 
So the idea is that by signing up, we are putting you
  <em>
    on the hook to make a goal after signing up, or we will charge you money
  </em>
  .
And if you&#8217;re not on board with that, you might not be in Beeminder&#8217;s target audience anyway.
(In case you are wondering, this is related to the soup nazi because it intentionally turns away a subset of potential customers.)

      Why in tarnation would we want to make it harder to sign up? 
Let us count the ways!
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Learningness. 
For example, our current CAPTCHA asks what is the thing you lose when you derail 
(hint: it rhymes with the gooey stuff bees make). 
People commonly skim that and say &#8220;honey&#8221; and then they&#8217;re forced to read it more carefully and in the process we introduce them to a bit of Beeminder lingo and make sure they&#8217;re clear on the commitment device thing.
      </li>
      <li>
        Investment. 
Like the free-form field where we ask you what you intend to beemind.

        regarding Noom, which embraces intentional signup friction to a truly ridiculous degree.
(And see the end of that thread for an experiment Duolingo did in which they concluded that it can be good to add intentional friction to signup if it makes you introspect about your goal in using Duolingo.)

        Onboarding. 
It&#8217;s painfully common for a user to sign up, immediately feel overwhelmed, and never create a single goal. 
Or create a half-assed one but delete it in the first week or make it stupidly easy or fail to think through a

        or otherwise fail to get themselves meaningfully on the hook. 
We&#8217;re attacking this from a few angles but one is to give the user an additional incentive to push through that overwhelm and figure it out.

Questions? To make sure you're on board with that, please say in your own words: (1) at least one Beeminder goal you intend to create, and (2) that you agree to pay $5 if you don't set up a goal by the deadline. Placeholder test: I intend to beemind knitting tiny party hats for bees so I have 100 completed by August. I'm on board with getting that goal created in a week or beeing charged $5!

    alt=\\"The meta commitment device [moneybag-emoji]. We're 1000% serious about signing up for Beeminder being a commitment device in itself. But we work hard to make sure it's an effective one and that we don't take your money unless you agree we should. * First, you can always email us at support@beeminder.com if you have any trouble! And we'll email you 24 hours before we take your money, so you've got time to let us know if something went wrong. * Another safeguard is that you can delete your whole account instantly in the first week if you're really not liking it. (It's easy after the first week as well, it's just no longer instant since that would defeat the point of the commitment device!) * If I were, hypothetically, to get charged that $5, is it game over? * That really should be hypothetical &mdash; it's not actually hard to create a Beeminder goal! But just in case, the answer is no, we'll just plaintively ask you, “if not now, when??” and hope that that finally lights the fire under your butt.\\"
    title=\\"Apologies for the screenshot of pure text. We hate when people do that. As penance we dutifully pasted every word of it as plaintext into the alt text (not to be confused with the hover/title text that you're reading now. Also, hey, thanks for reading our hovertext!\\"

</p>
<p>
  We make you type out what you want to beemind, and agree to the meta commitment device.
Once you&#8217;re all signed up that intention gets sent to the workerbees and they say howdy and prod you to get on it if you&#8217;ve not created a goal already. 
That opens up a handy channel to talk to a human if you&#8217;re confused. 
And now you&#8217;ve got Damocles&#8217;s $5 hanging over your head prompting you to actually follow through.
</p>
<p>
  This was super peasy to do because
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    we were already collecting the intentions and sending them to the workerbees, who
  </li>
  <li>
    already welcome newbees and offer assistance with getting started for people who are stuck.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  So pretty much all we had to do with registration was write some words in, and add a new check for the existence of the string &#8220;$5&#8221; in your &#8220;intentions&#8221; response.
We also added a nice little countdown to the empty gallery page et voila.

<p>
  Anyhow, it&#8217;s not the most uncontroversial thing we&#8217;ve tried but mostly no one thought it was too crazy of an idea so, as of last week, we&#8217;re trying it!
</p>
<p>
  It has dampened signups a little but that seems to be more than made up for in getting people to actually create goals.
Of the people that signed up in the past week since we deployed this, 22% have not created any goals.
We don&#8217;t have enough data yet on how many people are going to hit that one-week wall and actually get charged &#8212; only one person so far!
The percentage with no goals at all in the two weeks immediately prior to that was 58%.
</p>
<p>
  If it continues to go well we&#8217;ll be tempted to bump up the amount at risk to $10 or $20 instead of the current $5. 
Or jump to the logical conclusion of all this and require the creation of a meta goal as part of signup. 
But getting that right would take a lot more thought than this simple gateway drug commitment device did.

    Mark Forster
  </a>
  and his
  <a href=\\"http://www.markforster.net/\\">

Or you might know his various time management books, the most well-known being &#8220;
  <a href=\\"http://www.markforster.net/do-it-tomorrow/\\">
    Do It Tomorrow
  </a>
  &#8221;.
He&#8217;s also the inventor of the

    AutoFocus
  </a>
  system, which has been featured more than once on

    LifeHacker
  </a>
  .
</p>
<p>
  Forster has long advocated clarifying solid commitments as a core time management principle, so perhaps it should be no surprise that he has jumped on Beeminder with both feet.
In fact, over the last several days he has written a series of
  <a href=\\"http://www.markforster.net/blog/category/beeminder\\">
    articles and short posts about Beeminder
  </a>
  .
This has been a near watershed for us. There&#8217;s a decent chance that if you&#8217;re reading this now it&#8217;s because of Mark Forster!

<p>
  We already believed that Beeminder was the everlasting secret to personal productivity.
That&#8217;s why we quit our day jobs so we could try to change the world with it.

  For the full Beeminder story, you could start with
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/akrasia\\">
    our inaugural blog post
  </a>
  about akrasia and self-binding, a.k.a. commitment devices.
If you know all about commitment devices &#8212; perhaps you know one of
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/competitors\\">
    our competitors
  </a>
  like

  or

    GymPact
  </a>
  &#8212; but don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s special about Beeminder, the secret is that we combine Quantified Self with commitment contracts.
That means that (1) if you&#8217;re a lifehacking data nerd you&#8217;re going to adore us to pieces and 
(2) you can make commitment contracts that are based on data and
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/flexbind\\">
    much more flexible
  </a>
  than with something like StickK.

  Hackers in particular tend to like us a lot, and we just made it a lot easier to beemind your hacking.
</p>
<p>
  At the risk of launching a thousand rants from the old neckbeard guard, it&#8217;s hard to imagine what writing code was like before git and GitHub came along. 
GitHub has made it really easy for people to collaborate on projects, and gives you some
  <a href=\\"https://github.com/dreeves/TagTime/graphs/commit-activity\\">
    nifty stats
  </a>
  to boot.
</p>
<p>
  For some people, those shiny graphs are enough (and if that&#8217;s you, by all means, try out
  <a href=\\"http://tenxer.com\\">
    tenXer
  </a>
  ). 
But if you&#8217;re reading this, there&#8217;s a good chance that you&#8217;ve discovered that a little extra motivation can work wonders.
</p>
<p>
  We&#8217;ve now made it really easy to beemind your GitHub progress, adding it to our list of integrations (we&#8217;re going to need a bigger boat). 
Thanks to
  <a href=\\"http://labs.leto.net/2012/09/18/quantifying-for-fun-and-profit.html\\">
    Duke Leto
  </a>
  for taking the lead on an early version of an integration with GitHub.
</p>
<p>
  Both public and private repositories work &#8212; you authorize Beeminder to access the repository when you create the goal.
Right now you can choose to track your commits to a repository or the number of issues you close. 
If there are other things or ways you can think of to track your progress, let us know in the comments (or hack something together with
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/api\\">
    our API
  </a>
  ).
</p>
<p>
  Beeminder will automatically update your graph from GitHub once an hour, so once it&#8217;s set up, just keep coding away and closing issues. 
And stay on the Yellow Brick Road.

<h4 id=\\"dial .def\\">
  Commitment dial
</h4>
<p>
  : The three parameters, shown beneath your graph, that determine your goal and the steepness of the
  <em>
    bright red line
  </em>
  , that is, the rate of progress you&#8217;re committing to. 
The parameters are 
(1) goal date (the date by which you will complete the goal), 
(2) goal value (e.g., your target weight or the total number of hours working on a project), and 
(3) weekly rate (the steepness of your red line). 
You specify any two parameters and the third one is calculated for you.
Common pitfalls: 
setting a positive instead of negative rate for a weight loss goal (though it&#8217;s on purpose that that&#8217;s allowed; see
  <em>
    all-you-can-eat-buffet-hopping vacation
  </em>
  );
having a goal of working out 3 times a week and putting &#8220;3&#8221; as the goal value instead of the rate (the goal value will be the cumulative total when the goal date is reached, which for many kinds of goals is irrelevant);
setting a goal value of 0 for a
  <em>
    Do Less
  </em>
  goal (again, Beeminder plots the cumulative total so weaning yourself off of something with Do Less means making the rate eventually become zero, not the goal value).

  </em>
  , consisting of a timestamp and a value.
Datapoints are shown color-coded on the graph.
Green means 3 or more days of

  , 
blue means you&#8217;re safe for 2 days, 
orange means that tomorrow will be a

If you had a

  .
If you have a lot of

<h4 id=\\"domore .def\\">
  Do More goal
</h4>
<p>
  : This is the most common Beeminder goal type. 
You enter a value every time you do something you want to do more of &#8212; minutes of exercise, number of workouts, servings of vegetables, hours of work &#8212; and Beeminder
  <em>
    auto-sums
  </em>
  your

Sometimes the names &#8220;Do More&#8221; and &#8220;Do Less&#8221; cause confusion, if you just want to do something consistently, or perhaps never do something at all.
Think of them as goals to do more (or less) than you would otherwise do if left to your own devices.

  </em>
  to the graph for today &#8212; graphed as a tiny triangle &#8212; to show you where you are with respect to the

<h4 id=\\"flatspot .def\\">
  Flat spot
</h4>
<p>
  : A period in which your
  <em>

  </em>
  is paused, requiring no work.
You may want to add a flat spot for a vacation, for example.
You do so by
  <em>
    dialing down
  </em>
  your red line with the
  <em>
    commitment dial
  </em>
  .
When you start a new goal or
  <em>

  <em>

  </em>
  with no payment method on file (so no way for us to auto-rerail you) then your graph

A graph will also freeze if you
  <em>

There&#8217;s also a deadman switch that will make your graph eventually freeze if you don&#8217;t enter any data for long enough.
You can still add data to a frozen goal but the

It could be a literal odometer.
Another common example is beeminding reading a book by reporting your current page number rather than the number of pages you read.
If you report a zero then Beeminder treats that as the odometer getting reset (or starting a new book) and Beeminder keeps your cumulative total going.

  Pessimistic presumptive reports

  <em>
    Do Less

  goals and can be turned on or off in goal settings for goals with manual data entry, as opposed to
  <em>
    autodata goals
  </em>
  .
When you don&#8217;t report a value Beeminder conservatively assumes that you did twice whatever the current daily rate is.
It actually inserts a dummy datapoint to that effect telling you to edit it if it&#8217;s not correct.
So it&#8217;s the analog of
  <em>
    flatlining
  </em>
  for
  <em>
    Do More goals
  </em>
  .
Without this feature you can flake out and fail to report data and Beeminder will treat you as successful.

  Pledge
</h4>
<p>
  : The amount of money you have committed to pay if you

The initial pledge for a new goal is zero (if you&#8217;re using a
  <em>
    freebee
  </em>
  ) or $5.
Each time you derail it increases &#8212; $5, $10, $30, $90, $270, $810 &#8212; though you can choose not to increase the pledge or even drop back down to a lower pledge level.
By following the pledge schedule you will quickly close in on your
  <em>
    motivation point
  </em>
  . 
You can increase your pledge at any time, or
  <em>
    short-circuit
  </em>
  , by paying half the currently pledged amount.
That takes effect immediately.
You can lower your pledge for free but it&#8217;s subject to the

Every day of

Sum those over all your goals and you have an urgency metric that you want to keep as low as possible.
A

  adds a full 7 to your urgency load, having 6 days of safety buffer on something adds 1, etc.
And adding new goals can at best leave your urgency load unchanged, if you keep them at 7+ days of buffer.

<p>
  Two years ago, when I still had a day job and Beeminder was just a
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/beenamer\\"
    title=\\"It was Kibotzer, the kibitzing robot\\"
  >
    side project
  </a>
  , I wrote about my epic struggle with email:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    My email is dysfunctional. 
I keep things in my inbox because I can&#8217;t afford for them to go out of sight, out of mind &#8212; but then that’s exactly what happens. 
They get buried deeper and deeper in my inbox by all the other messages I delusionally think I&#8217;m going to deal with.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  That was the preface of a
  <a href=\\"http://messymatters.com\\">
    Messy Matters
  </a>
  article,
  <a href=\\"http://messymatters.com/email\\">
    Inbox Zeroer
  </a>
  , 
in which I proposed that we all declare email bankruptcy and stop adding things to each other&#8217;s task lists willy nilly. 
No, but seriously, I laid out a wish list for some tools to help me reach Inbox Zero, namely, email snooze, re-ping, and auto-expire.
Soon after writing that, I switched from Pine to Gmail and eventually implemented email snooze and re-ping using
  <a href=\\"https://developers.google.com/apps-script/\\">
    Google Apps Script
  </a>
  .

    id=\\"SNZ1\\"

  </a>
</p>
<p>
  Guess what I found out?
The fundamental problem wasn&#8217;t my email processing tools, it was my damn brain.
Having an amazing IDE with built-in refactoring tools and a Turing-complete macro language won&#8217;t just make you produce code.
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"IDE1\\"
    href=\\"#IDE\\"

  </a>
  And as great as email snooze and re-ping are (they&#8217;re pretty great) they don&#8217;t solve your fundamental procrastination problem.
</p>
<p>
  This sounds like a case for &#8212; Beeminder!
</p>
<p>

  </a>
  , convinced us to integrate with Gmail to automate the reporting.
(His argument was very persuasive: he hacked up a prototype for us.)
</p>
<h3>
  How it Works
</h3>
<p>
  Beeminder periodically checks your inbox throughout the day and records the number of
  <em>
    Read
  </em>
  messages.
The graph plots only the minimum count of the day, so that you just have to hit the low point and stay there long enough for Beeminder to pick up on it.
This lets you make slow forward progress toward inbox zero without having to declare email bankruptcy.
Plus, it makes you seem like an amazingly thoughtful person when you actually do pick up that email thread from two years ago and respond.
</p>
<p>
  GmailZero only works for people who (try to) diligently archive messages. 
It doesn&#8217;t count Unread messages against you since you don&#8217;t have control over those.
For example, the 1000 messages you get on vacation? Not a problem &#8212; we don&#8217;t count them until you get home and start reading through them.
</p>
<p>
  Ignoring unread messages is a double-edged sword, of course. 
One user reports that he finds himself marking things as unread in order to avoid Beeminder&#8217;s sting (or having to deal with the emails, unclear which!).
Another marks a batch of unread messages as read at the end of each day, putting her on the hook to deal with them tomorrow.

    Changes to GmailZero!

  Google recently stopped supporting their very old OAuth1 authentication strategy, which is what we&#8217;d been using to access all y&#8217;all&#8217;s Gmail accounts. 
We&#8217;ve talked about our Gmail integration,

    title=\\"Discussing the OAuth1 to OAuth2 changes\\"

  </a>
  .)
But Inbox Zero is only one inbox strategy, and we&#8217;ve had lots of people ask us for ways to automatically mind
  <em>
    other
  </em>
  inbox strategies.
</p>
<p>
  Since we were revisiting GmailZero to bring it up to code
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"UVI1\\"
    href=\\"#UVI\\"
  >
    [1]
  </a>
  , and since the new Gmail API makes it much nicer, we added support for beeminding any arbitrary query on your inbox.
</p>
<p>
  Query wut? What the worlds does she mean by that?
</p>
<p>
  I mean right now, if you&#8217;re GmailZeroing, we count up the total number of Read threads in your Gmail inbox.
By default you&#8217;re beeminding &#8220;in:inbox AND is:read&#8221;.
Now you can change that to be counting anything you can type into the search box of Gmail.
Like maybe you just want to count
  <em>
    anything
  </em>
  in your inbox, then you would change your Gmail Query to &#8220;in:inbox&#8221;. 
(I need this. I abuse the loophole of just leaving everything unread and untouched in my inbox.)
</p>
<p>
  Since this is very general, that means it&#8217;s possible to mess it up, so I recommend experimenting with the search results, maybe kind of like the way you do when you&#8217;re creating a filter in Gmail, to make sure you&#8217;re getting just what you want, then copy the search string into the goal settings.
</p>
<p>
  Also, since it&#8217;s rather advanced, we didn&#8217;t add this into the goal wizard at
  <a
    href=\\"http://gmailzero.com\\"
    title=\\"Aka beeminder.com/gmailzero -- the landing page for GmailZero where you can create new GmailZero goals.\\"
  >
    GmailZero.com
  </a>
  .
In order to customize this, you&#8217;ll need to create the GmailZero goal and then go into the goal&#8217;s advanced settings and edit the query.

<h3>
  Use Case Ideas
</h3>
<h4>
  1. Gmail Snooze
</h4>
<p>
  We&#8217;ve already mentioned one loophole with GmailZeroing, namely the Unread messages loophole. 
Our esteemed CEO has an elaborate system for
  <a
    href=\\"http://messymatters.com/snooze/\\"
    title=\\"Dreeves&#39;s blog post with a link to install his Gmail Snooze thing (it&#39;s a Google Apps Script)\\"
  >
    snoozing emails
  </a>
  which uses integer labels to get things temporarily out of the inbox and scheduled to return in a given number of days.
But it leaves another gaping loophole akin to the Unread messages problem &#8212; you can just snooze everything when your inbox goal is about to derail.
Until now he&#8217;s been using another elaborate system &#8212;
  <a
    href=\\"https://github.com/beeminder/gminder\\"
    title=\\"Also a Google Apps Script\\"

    Gminder

    title=\\"Also anomalily on Beeminder, and on Twitter and such\\"
  >
    Lillian Karabaic
  </a>
  ) &#8212;
to beemind all snoozed messages as well as inbox messages.
I.e., to whittle away at
  <em>
    all
  </em>
  of the messages he&#8217;s putting off responding to.
</p>
<p>
  But now the official GmailZero can do it!

<h4>
  2. Beeminding a backlog
</h4>
<p>
  Have you ever heard someone talk about declaring &#8220;email bankruptcy&#8221;? 
I guess that&#8217;s just throwing your arms up in defeat and foreswearing all messages you&#8217;ve received up to now, but
  <em>
    this time
  </em>
  I won&#8217;t fall behind&#8230;
While the &#8220;this time&#8221; sure sounds like a job for Beeminder, what about that poor backlog? Can&#8217;t we do better than that?
Sure, go ahead and draw your line in the sand, but how about instead of just mass archiving them, create a backlog tag and then beemind whittling that away to nothing. 
In other words, create a label &#8220;backlog&#8221; and set your Gmail Query to &#8220;in:backlog&#8221;.

  3. Unread messages

  Some people never archive messages and let their inbox grow without bound, and are fine with that.
For them, their real inbox is the unread messages and that&#8217;s what they want to beemind.
If that&#8217;s you, set your query to &#8220;is:unread&#8221;, or &#8220;in:inbox AND is:unread&#8221; or whatever variation makes sense for you.
</p>
<h4>
  4. Starred messages
</h4>
<p>
  Or maybe you want to be more explicit about the set of messages you still need to deal with but still don&#8217;t want to have to archive everything else.
So you put stars upon thars.
And your query would be &#8220;is:starred&#8221;.
</p>
<p>
  (Side note from Dreeves: 
I&#8217;ve heard people claiming to have solved their Inbox Zero woes by just starring things.
  <em>
    That doesn&#8217;t solve anything!
  </em>
  The list of messages with stars is your new &#8220;inbox&#8221; and just as much diligence is required to keep it from swelling to an overwhelming sea.)
</p>
<h4>
  5. Recent messages, with attachments, from people in your Google+ family circle and not from mailing lists
</h4>
<p>
  Just kidding.
About wanting to beemind that, I mean.
You could though!
The point is the sky&#8217;s the limit.

  There&#8217;s not actually an easy way to query for
  <em>
    all
  </em>
  integer labels so he&#8217;s settling for checking all messages snoozed up to 9 days, like so:
</p>
<pre>
  is:read AND (in:inbox OR in:0 OR in:1 OR in:2 OR in:3 
OR in:4 OR in:5 OR in:6 OR in:7 OR in:8 OR in:9)
</pre>
<p>
  If he finds himself snoozing lots of things for 10 days in order to keep Beeminder happy then it will be back to his Gminder script.
But usually you&#8217;re far more willing to snooze till tomorrow than to 10 days from now.
After all, if it&#8217;s so unimportant that you don&#8217;t mind ignoring it for 10 days then maybe you can just archive it.

    Gmail integration
  </a>
  . 
You can connect Gmail and Beeminder, set up a new goal, and Beeminder starts tracking the number of read messages in your inbox. 
To get that number, Beeminder needed permission to perform searches of your email. 
Gmail is tightening the restrictions on what it takes to get this permission, and we won&#8217;t be able to do this. 
You may have noticed that over the past year, many services that used to integrate with Gmail have stopped or have changed their integration. 
We haven&#8217;t been able to find a good non-developer-oriented page from Google about this, but
  <a
    href=\\"https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/9110914?hl=en\\"
    title=\\"Per Google: This page has answers to frequently asked questions about Google Cloud Platform OAuth policy violations\\"
  >
    they do have a developer FAQ
  </a>
  .
</p>
<p>
  This is a net positive change for the world.
If fewer malicious actors steal email because of this change, it&#8217;s probably worth the hassle of Beeminder changing how it works.
And we think the new way of beeminding Gmail should be better or just as good as the old way for nearly everyone.
</p>
<p>
  So, how does beeminding your Gmail work now?
Our new permissions only allow us to view your labels.
This includes how many messages are read and unread for each label, but doesn&#8217;t include any details about the emails themselves.
</p>
<p>
  When you create a Gmail goal, Beeminder shows you this screen:
</p>
<p>
  <img
    class=\\"aligncenter\\"
    alt=\\"Screenshot of the UI for picking what label to beemind\\"
    title=\\"Screenshot of the UI for picking what label to beemind\\"

  >
</p>
<p>
  By default, it looks for read messages in your inbox, but there are two dropdowns where you can set Beeminder to look at only unread, only read, or all messages that match any of your labels.
</p>
<p>
  What if you want to beemind something else with your email?
</p>
<p>
  Not everyone has used Gmail labels, but they&#8217;re pretty slick.
You can manually label emails.
There are also a few built-in labels, like INBOX, that are auto-applied.
Otherwise, the main way to label email is by doing a search, and then creating a filter from that search.
</p>
<h2>
  One Little Tricksy Caveat
</h2>
<p>
  Labels applied by filters are applied when the email arrives, and this means that not all searches that used to be supported will be supported in this new world order.
Gmail actually warns you if you try to create a label from a filter that doesn&#8217;t apply to new email &#8212; things like &#8220;email older than 3 days&#8221; &#8212; because email won&#8217;t be older than 3 days the moment it arrives.
</p>
<p>
  If you&#8217;re using a search that can&#8217;t be turned into a label-applying filter, there&#8217;s at least one other way to get your email labeled.
Google says that Google Apps Script running on your own email won&#8217;t fall afoul of their new restrictions.
I actually use this to do complicated things with my email already.
If you need this, I can write a tutorial on applying labels using Google Apps Script. 
Let us know!

<h2>
  Transition
</h2>
<p>
  We are emailing everyone with existing Gmail goals to explain what they need to do in order to keep their goals working.
</p>
<p>
  Folks who were using the default &#8220;beemind read messages in my inbox&#8221; will have their search migrated over automatically.
Folks who had custom Gmail search queries will need to migrate their search query to a label and set the label in the goal&#8217;s settings page.
</p>
<p>
  Everyone who was beeminding Gmail before will have to disconnect and reconnect Gmail in their

    title=\\"You have to be logged in to Beeminder to see this\\"
  >

  </a>
  .
This will get you the right permissions, limiting us to just looking at labels.
</p>
<p>
  In conclusion:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    If you already have a Gmail goal, you&#8217;ll get an email saying what you have to do (and by when!)
  </li>
  <li>
    New Gmail goals are already on the new setup and will use labels the whole time
  </li>
  <li>
    Folks can sleep a little easier knowing that Beeminder will no longer be asking for email-searching permission to beemind your Gmail
  </li>
  <li>
    We think that the new setup is a global positive, even though there may be a few goals that aren&#8217;t easily transferred to the new setup. (Although, if this is you, we want to hear about it!)

  Previously, to count your messages, Beeminder needed users to grant it full read-only permission on your email in order to do arbitrary search queries.
Not great! 
We totally support Google tightening this up so we only need permission for exactly what we&#8217;re doing:

I know there are some power users tearing their hair out here because they have legit use cases for long goalnames, like an elaborate naming scheme for goals and sub-goals and meta-sub-goals.
We apologize for breaking your workflow but there&#8217;s just no way to allow long goalnames without newbees doing things like &#8220;goal-to-lose-at-least-10-pounds&#8221;.

    This is just a little sidebar to let you know about a handy trick with the Beeminder SMS bot.
Instead of typing out the whole goalname, you can type only as many characters of it as are needed to disambiguate it from all your other goals.
Even if you have dozens of goals, this is often just a few characters.
Yes, this trick kind of undermines a bit of the point of this post, about how important concise goalnames are!
It only mildly undermines it though.

  we shrunk the length limit from infinity to 50 characters and grandfathered existing goals that exceeded it.
We&#8217;re now doing that again but without the grandfathering because we want to get rid of the technical debt and special cases and just be able to count on goalnames being at most 20 characters.
(Expect an email about renaming any over-long goalnames you may have.)

If it&#8217;s not your thing, you could ask your friends to help you brainstorm good goalnames next time you have something new to beemind.

<h3>
  Conclusion
</h3>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;Your goal description is where you can write out a sentence about your goal&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  There are several practical reasons for concise one-word goalnames.
Goals need to be referred to in email subject lines and the SMS bot where space is tight.
Also the aesthetics of page layout, especially on small screens like for the smartphone apps, is easier with consistently sized goalnames.
Another practical reason is that the goalname is used in the URL for your goal/graph and

  More generally, goals need stable descriptors: the name of your graph should persist through changes to your commitment.
Your goal description is where you can write out a sentence about your goal and update it as you refine what you&#8217;re committing to.
A goalname is a

  >
    concept handle
  </a>
  for your goal.
</p>
<p>
  The answer to Beeminder&#8217;s persnicketiness about goalnames is to make up evocative, one-word neologisms for them. 
It&#8217;s a valuable constraint that makes it easier to refer to beemergencies you have, both out loud and when interacting with the Beeminder bot.
</p>
<p>
  UPDATE: Well, we sent out the emails, thinking that we could deal with tricky renaming case-by-case, maybe add some legacy redirects as needed, grandfather anything where it really didn&#8217;t work.
This was naive and I was wrong.
There&#8217;s an overwhelming amount of pushback and so the new decision is all existing goalnames are grandfathered.

Beeminder just got very slightly worse for a very tiny fraction of users &#8212; those who really like their unwieldy goalnames.
We think it&#8217;s better on net but on net doesn&#8217;t cut it for the Pareto Dominance Principle.

    My first reaction to the idea of gratitude journaling &#8212; which I didn&#8217;t realize was
    <a href=\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratitude_journal\\">
      a thing
    </a>
    , until people started beeminding it &#8212; was, well, I&#8217;ll spare you my snark.
Then I tried to articulate my knee-jerkery and came up with this:
It seems to have a protesteth-too-much vibe.
I mean, what&#8217;s
    <b>
      not
    </b>
    to be grateful for?
Everything is amazing!
Even the poorest of us live in historically unfathomable luxury.
Hot showers, personal carriages to transport you anywhere in the world, practically swimming in food.
Mattresses and fluffy pillows and heat and air conditioning.
Seriously mind-boggling luxury; I&#8217;m not being at all sarcastic.
Almost all of the work it takes to keep yourself fed, clothed, sheltered, clean, etc &#8212; the chores of daily life &#8212; most of it is just done for you, even if you&#8217;re poor.
You don&#8217;t hand-wash your clothes or fetch water or have to build anything or make soap or split firewood or whatever other things would take up most waking hours before we found ourselves in this opulent world.
Fine, most people do the equivalent of that for 40 hours/week, working to be able to afford all this luxury, but, really, you could get pretty much every luxury I just mentioned for probably 10 hours/week of work, at minimum wage.

    It wouldn&#8217;t be
    <b>
      quite
    </b>
    as nice, but, well, that&#8217;s another thing:
All the things we think of as separating rich from poor in the first world is truly quibbling.
Threadcount of your sheets?
How fast your car could go if it were legal to go that fast?
Whether you&#8217;re a little cramped or not in the seat in the motherfrakking airplane that&#8217;s flying you thousands of miles in a matter of hours?
How conveniently located your magically lighted and heated home is?
  </i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>
    I sure am grumpy about how wonderful everything is!
Actually, what&#8217;s interesting is that there&#8217;s simultaneously an infinite list of things to be happy about
    <b>
      and
    </b>
    an infinite list of things to be unhappy about.
Like crime and cancer and computers crashing.
So I guess I now understand gratitude journals: it&#8217;s a trick to keep some of your attention on the first list.
I&#8217;m grateful that I don&#8217;t have that problem.

    But then I thought I should try it out.
Here&#8217;s how it&#8217;s going so far:

<h2>
  Gratitude Journaling, by Michelle Robindell
</h2>
<p>
  A few years ago, I participated in a weekly &#8220;Happiness Circle&#8221; series led by another co-active coach, Sarah Dakin. 
There, we talked about, learned about, and practiced happiness.
The biggest and most helpful habit I took away from that experience was the practice of writing a daily Gratitude Journal.
It&#8217;s very simple: each day, write down three things you&#8217;re grateful for.
</p>
<p>
  It is well-documented that having a daily practice of gratitude journaling can improve our happiness.
</p>
<p>
  According to Brené Brown, research professor at the University of Houston, gratitude and joyfulness are inextricably linked:
&#8220;Every research participant who spoke about the ability to stay open to joy also talked about the importance of practicing gratitude.&#8221;
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"BVB1\\"
    href=\\"#BVB\\"
  >
    [2]
  </a>
  She goes on to say that having an &#8220;attitude of gratitude&#8221; or simply &#8220;feeling grateful&#8221; weren&#8217;t enough &#8212; participants spoke of tangible gratitude practices such as gratitude journals, gratitude jars, and family gratitude rituals.
</p>
<p>
  A 2003 experiment found that those who kept gratitude journals on a weekly basis exercised more regularly, reported fewer physical symptoms, felt better about their lives as a whole, and were more optimistic about the upcoming week compared to those who recorded hassles or neutral life events
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"WEL1\\"
    href=\\"#WEL\\"

    [3]
  </a>
  .
In a more recent study
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"VUL1\\"
    href=\\"#VUL\\"
  >
    [4]
  </a>
  , Emmons and Mishra discovered that grateful people:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    report higher levels of positive emotions, life satisfaction, vitality, optimism and lower levels of depression and stress;
  </li>
  <li>
    have the capacity to be empathic and to take the perspective of others;
  </li>
  <li>
    are more likely to acknowledge a belief in the interconnectedness of all life and a commitment to and responsibility to others;
  </li>
  <li>
    place less importance on material goods; they are less likely to judge their own and others success in terms of possessions accumulated; they are less envious of others; and are more likely to share their possessions
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  For about six months as I participated in the Happiness Circle, I dutifully wrote in my gratitude journal.
I really did find that it made a big difference to my happiness. 
I was more appreciative of my family members, the roof over my head, the food in my fridge, and even the little things like fall leaves crunching under my feet.
I even appreciated things I would normally complain about: 
the rain (for feeding our rainforests), 
the alarm clock (that made sure I got up on time every morning), 
my dog barking (to let us know we might be under squirrel attack). 
And the days I most needed it (you know, those Mondays where everything seems to go wrong) were the days my gratitude journal made the biggest difference.
</p>
<p>
  But then I got out of the habit.
We put our house on the market and
  <em>
    everything
  </em>
  had to be put away tidily.
My journal, normally sitting on my bedside table where I couldn&#8217;t forget to write in it, was tucked away in a drawer.
</p>
<p>
  I don&#8217;t know about you, but when I forget to do something, even for one day, it completely throws me off.
The next day, I&#8217;m not sure whether I should write two entries, or if I should just skip that day and go on to the next one.
I freeze, and I don&#8217;t make a decision at all.
So my gratitude journal sat idle for several months.
Several
  <em>
    stressful
  </em>
  months (while our house sat on the market, and we had to keep it spotless).
If ever there was a time to improve my happiness, this was it.
</p>
<p>
  Coincidentally, one of my coaching clients introduced me to Beeminder.
I started to use it to track my sugar intake &#8212; I&#8217;m aiming for 1 serving every second day &#8212; and it worked like a charm!
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;Why not use Beeminder to track my gratitude?&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  After we (finally) sold our house and moved, I decided to start writing in my gratitude journal again.
But I couldn&#8217;t find it!
It must still be packed in a box.
It occurred to me &#8212; why not use Beeminder to track my gratitude?
Now I get an email on a daily basis, in the evening as I&#8217;m settling in.
I just need to do a quick reply and I&#8217;ve captured my three items of gratitude.
If I add a fourth one every once in a while, it means I have some &#8220;buffer&#8221; and if I forget to do it one evening, it&#8217;s okay &#8212; I can skip that day.
It means I can do it whether I&#8217;m at home on my computer or out and on my blackberry.
I highly recommend it!
</p>
<p>
  Need more detailed instructions? 
Let&#8217;s return to Robert Emmons, the leading scientific expert on gratitude, for his
  <a href=\\"http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/tips_for_keeping_a_gratitude_journal\\">
    research-based tips
  </a>
  :
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>
      Don’t just go through the motions.
    </strong>
    Research by psychologist Sonja Lyubomirsky and others suggests that journaling is more effective if you first make the conscious decision to become happier and more grateful. “Motivation to become happier plays a role in the efficacy of journaling,” says Emmons.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      Go for depth over breadth.
    </strong>
    Elaborating in detail about a particular thing for which you’re grateful carries more benefits than a superficial list of many things.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      Get personal.
    </strong>
    Focusing on
    <em>
      people
    </em>
    to whom you are grateful has more of an impact than focusing on
    <em>
      things
    </em>
    for which you are grateful.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      Try subtraction, not just addition.
    </strong>
    One effective way of stimulating gratitude is to reflect on what your life would be like
    <em>
      without
    </em>
    certain blessings, rather than just tallying up all those good things.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      Savor surprises.
    </strong>
    Try to record events that were unexpected or surprising, as these tend to elicit stronger levels of gratitude.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      Don’t overdo it.
    </strong>
    Writing occasionally (once or twice per week) is more beneficial than daily journaling. In fact, one study by Lyubomirsky and her colleagues found that people who wrote in their gratitude journals once a week for six weeks reported boosts in happiness afterward; people who wrote three times per week didn’t. “We adapt to positive events quickly, especially if we constantly focus on them,” says Emmons. “It seems counterintuitive, but it is how the mind works.”

  At its core, Beeminder is a tool for getting yourself to do things using money as an incentive. 
Most goals on Beeminder focus on making steady progress over time. 
But some goals, and some people, work better with a different model.
</p>
<p>
  Let’s say you
  <em>
    have
  </em>
  to call someone by the end of the day today, and you want to use something like Beeminder to add a monetary incentive to make sure it gets done. 
It’s a one-off task, that either gets completed or not, with a firm deadline in the near-ish future. 
Beeminder actually won’t let you set a goal date that’s less than a week away. 
And even if it did, it wouldn’t make much sense to beemind this one thing &#8212; you’d have a single datapoint and the goal would be achieved. 
Full-on beeminding is overkill for this situation.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;Full-on Beeminding is overkill for this situation&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  Enter GTBee.
It’s a simple to-do list that integrates with Beeminder’s API. 
Add a task, set a deadline, and if you don’t check it off in time, you’ll be charged $5. 
If you miss a deadline, you can decide to raise the motivational stakes and double to $10 (and so on if you continue to miss). 
You can also just remove the task or start another one at $5. 
You’ll get a push notification if one of your tasks is due in 24 hours, and again when the deadline is an hour away. 
You’ll also get an email when a charge goes through. 
The charges are for real &#8212; but if you reply to the email with “just testing” we’ll give you one free pass in case you want to test things out. 
After that you’re on the hook.

    This is a guest post by Beeminder user Jill Renaud.
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  I hate my current gym.
It is a budget gym with no classes, machines in disrepair, and the other members can be downright rude.
I can be patiently waiting for a machine and be cut off by a gym rat. A literal rat. (Kidding. It&#8217;s not quite that bad.)
So I visited a much nicer gym and want to join.
The gym has two main membership options: month to month, with no contract, at a cost of $75 per month; or a longer-term contract (1 year for $750, 2 years for $1200, or 3 years for $1500).
Assuming that I will actually use the gym membership for the duration of the contract, it makes the most financial sense to buy a long term contract.
The three-year membership is the most economical, working out to $41.67 per month, which would save $1125 compared to buying month-to-month.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  The savings are predicated on the assumption that you actually consistently use the gym.
</h4>
<p>
  Of course, gyms know that actual attendance &#8212; especially over the course of years &#8212; doesn&#8217;t always align with the good intentions you had when you were signing up and they make a killing by offering these sorts of contract &#8220;savings&#8221; because the savings are predicated on the assumption that you actually consistently use the gym over the entire contract period.
So how can I ensure consistent use of the gym?
Beemind it of course. ;)

  </a>
</p>
<p>
  One of the main reasons that I want to join this gym is for the fitness classes.
I have found that historically I have no problem doing cardio.
I&#8217;m the typical female cardio queen at the gym: I am naturally inclined towards cycling, walking, jogging, using the elliptical, etc., but I cannot compel myself to pick up a weight.
A membership at this gym allows me to attend several free weightlifting/resistance classes, which I need, but I cannot take these classes if I am not a member of the gym.
I value these classes at about $10 per class so if I attend 4.17 classes per month (approximately 1 per week) then I would break even with the $41.67/month membership.
If I attend a resistance-type class
  <em>
    twice
  </em>
  a week then it&#8217;s a great deal and I think that is reasonable to expect of myself in order to get in shape.
</p>
<p>
  Building in a safety buffer, I have decided that 1.8 classes per week (9 every 5 weeks) would still be cost-efficient and help me meet my fitness goals.
</p>
<p>
  Of course, for a Beeminder road to be successful, I must feel that it is high-stakes enough to force me to reach my goal.
I have decided, arbitrarily, to risk $1125, which is the amount that the three-year membership saves me over the course of the gym membership contract.
As it goes with Beeminder contracts this means that I will have to pay out $1125 to the owner of the contract if I ever go below my Yellow Brick Road:

    got married
  </a>
  !
This may not bode well for the motivational power of Jill&#8217;s gym contract but it bodes very well for Jill and Ed!
</p>
<p>
  UPDATE 2012-09-28 from Jill:
I&#8217;m now 1.5 years into my 3-year goal but nowhere near the numerical halfway mark.
I&#8217;ve had a lot of flat spots on my road because of various life events &#8212; marriage, moving to a new place, living 3000 miles away from my spouse for a few months, and perhaps a bit of laziness mixed in.
I should be at 141 workouts right now, but I am only at 123.
I am redoubling my efforts so that by the end of my gym contract I will hit the 281 workouts that I need to satisfy my goal.
And, yes, having your husband own your contract when money is shared isn&#8217;t necessarily the best idea.
The current Beeminder implementation of Danny and Bethany taking your money is much more motivating. :-)

  The Beeminder folks would like to point out that this sort of thing, more generally, is a great use for Beeminder: insurance against wasting money on gym memberships or fancy treadmills.

  </a>
  &#8212; we might be most nervous about
  <a href=\\"http://gympact.com\\">
    GymPact
  </a>
  .
GymPact is currently an iPhone app (UPDATE: Android as well now) that pays you money for going to the gym, funded by the slackers who failed to get themselves off the couch.
But they just
  <a href=\\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/28/gympact-seed-round/\\">
    raised almost a million dollars of funding
  </a>
  and changed their name to Pact, Inc with the intention to expand beyond incentivizing gym usage.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  You&#8217;re literally betting on your own success and the people who lose fund the people who win.
</h4>
<p>
  GymPact&#8217;s business model is one we thought we&#8217;d try for Beeminder at one point: 
You&#8217;re literally betting on your own success and the people who lose fund the people who win.
We shied away from that in part because of the
  <a href=\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_selection\\">
    adverse selection
  </a>
  problem.
The adverse selection, in GymPact&#8217;s case, is that gym rats &#8212; people who go to the gym every day anyway &#8212; will be especially incentivized to sign up.
Even worse is that you can make money by cheating.
For example, you could hack your iPhone so it reports that you&#8217;re living at the gym.
Last we checked that was especially easy: you self-report your gym&#8217;s location, meaning you could enter the address of your favorite bar.
(We&#8217;re not suggesting this is a dealbreaker for GymPact&#8217;s model.)
</p>
<p>
  We don&#8217;t have that problem with Beeminder since your only reward is being awesome and reaching the end of your yellow brick road.
(And getting our pretty graphs and bot reminders and data import/export and whatnot for free &#8212; I guess that&#8217;s nothing to sneeze at!)
But that means it has zero appeal to cheaters and
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/weasels\\">
    weaselers
  </a>
  , which is why we&#8217;re able to be generous about what counts as a legitimate derailment without it inviting abuse.
</p>
<p>
  Speaking of perverse incentives, we&#8217;re often asked about our own.
It seems that from the perspective of those paying us, Beeminder is providing a ton of value and a ton of motivation and the occasional cost of derailment is a fair fee for Beeminder&#8217;s service. 
In that sense it&#8217;s almost natural that the fee is waived for people who never go off track. 
Those people evidently didn&#8217;t really need Beeminder in the first place.

  Hey busy bees! 
The awesome Beeminder team has asked us to write a guest post for them about all the ways that Habitica and Beeminder can work together to make you into your best self this year.

<h2>
  Wait, what&#8217;s Habitica?
</h2>
<p>
  Habitica (formerly HabitRPG) is a gamified website and mobile app for improving your real-life habits and productivity! 
You create an old-school pixel avatar that you can level up, like you&#8217;re in a role-playing game, but the catch is that you can only improve your character by improving your real life!
</p>
<p>
  As you&#8217;re checking off your real-world Habits, your Daily goals, and your To-Do list, you&#8217;ll unlock features such as armor, pets, and even quests! 
We also have a social side, so you can join a party with your friends and issue each other Challenges to improve your lives. 
Plus, we&#8217;re an

    open-source community

so feel free to jump in and contribute!

<p>
  You can access Habitica through

  . 
Plus, we have an

    iOS app
  </a>

    title=\\"Habitica app in the Google Play store\\"

</p>
<p>
  So how does Habitica make you more productive? 
You&#8217;ll divide up your tasks into Habits, Dailies, and To-Dos, all of which affect your character in different ways.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    To-Dos are the items on your list that you want to check off once, like finishing your thesis. 
By completing them, you earn gold to buy awesome things and level up your avatar to unlock more features.
  </li>
  <li>
    Dailies are tasks that repeat every day (or on certain days), like flossing or going to the gym. 
These, too, can award you gold and experience if you complete them, but if you skip them, your avatar will lose health.
  </li>
  <li>
    Habits are things that you do multiple times a day. 
Good Habits reward you, but bad Habits cause you to lose health.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>
  So why use Habitica and Beeminder together?
</h2>
<p>
  Habitica can add some positive reinforcement and fun flavor to your Beeminder tasks &#8212; a bit of honey, if you will. 
You may find it easier to keep goals green because you&#8217;ll be motivated to earn all the fun rewards you get on Habitica &#8212; like earning that final piece of fish to grow your awesome skeleton wolf into a mount. 
There may even be some minor habits that you wanted to form that didn&#8217;t seem important enough for Beeminder &#8212; Habitica is very flexible, so you can include anything that you want to work on! 
You can get excited to complete tasks, but then if you need that extra edge, keep Beeminder&#8217;s tough love constantly working in the background.
</p>
<p>
  We&#8217;re built around the idea of rewards, not just punishment (although some of our monsters pack quite the punch). 
To that end, we also have a whole column for rewards that you can earn with gold &#8212; either in-game equipment, or custom rewards that you define yourself. 
Won&#8217;t it feel good to actually earn that Netflix binge?
</p>
<p>
  The other big draw of using Habitica with Beeminder is to gain the accountability advantage of our vibrant, friendly community! 
On our website we even have
  <a
    href=\\"https://habitica.com/#/options/groups/guilds/dca65ca5-2bae-442d-a564-d1a1fb6a00b4\\"
    title=\\"That&#39;s right, Habitica has guilds\\"
  >
    a Beeminder Guild
  </a>
  for all of you lovely people.
And of course, we also have some good old-fashioned competition&#8230; for example,
  <a
    href=\\"https://habitica.com/#/options/groups/challenges/f47190de-ba2e-48a3-bb8f-db3b9fa28de5\\"
    title=\\"Obscure note: Challenge To-Dos don&#39;t count towards Beeminder goals connected to Habitica\\"
  >
    a Challenge for keeping all your Beeminder goals green
  </a>
  , 
so you can compete against other Habiticans for a prize.

<h2>
  The Beeminder-Habitica Integration
</h2>
<p>
  The best way to use Beeminder and Habitica together is through
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/habitica\\"
    title=\\"If you&#39;ve read all this and aren&#39;t clicking this link then we have not done our jobs\\"
  >
    the official integration
  </a>
  !
This is a nifty Beeminder tool that automatically checks all your Habitica To-Dos, letting you aim to have either more completed To-Dos or fewer uncompleted To-Dos.
</p>
<p>
  What&#8217;s the difference? 
You can encourage yourself to finish as many To-Dos as possible by tracking more completed To-Dos. 
On the other hand, if you&#8217;ve got too many To-Dos and you want to whittle them down, you can track your uncompleted To-Dos.

<h3>
  Beeminder Reprise
</h3>
<p>
  You&#8217;re probably here because you either know and love Beeminder, or you know and love HabitRPG. 
So hi there, friendly Habiteers! 
Since this is Beeminder turf we&#8217;ll start with a quick explanation of what Beeminder&#8217;s all about. 
(For the full Beeminder story, you could start with
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/akrasia\\"
    title=\\"'How To Do What You Want: Akrasia and Self-Binding'\\"
  >
    our inaugural blog post
  </a>
  about akrasia and self-binding, a.k.a. commitment devices.)
</p>
<p>
  Beeminder&#8217;s a lot like HabitRPG. 
The big picture is that Beeminder helps you stick to things that would otherwise get trampled underfoot by the rest of your life.
That is, we get you doing those things you want to do, but never find time for, or those things you need to do but you keep putting off because UGH.
</p>
<p>
  What&#8217;s special about Beeminder is that we combine Quantified Self (and goal tracking) with commitment contracts.
If you don&#8217;t know anything about commitment devices, it works like this with Beeminder:
We plot your progress along a Yellow Brick Road to your goal and if you go off track, we charge you money.
Long-time Beeminder users find that those stings (get it?) are well worth it for all the awesomeness we induce the rest of the time.
But if the thought of having to pay money is too scary, that&#8217;s perfect: you&#8217;ll be very motivated to keep all your datapoints on your yellow brick road.
We don&#8217;t even ask for a credit card until the first time you go off track.
</p>
<h3>
  HabitRPG
</h3>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;Add a stick to HabitRPG&#8217;s carrot&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  HabitRPG is all about gamifying your life. 
And OMG, who wouldn&#8217;t want to live in an 8-bit fantasy world where you earn gold for flossing your teeth, and reward yourself for taking out the garbage! 
They have quests to level up your character at habbity things, and you can spend your gold on various bling for your character and build up adorable little pixelated pets and earn bling for them too!
They have a lot more in the way of community support than Beeminder as you can join up with a group to complete the quests and support each other along the way.
There&#8217;s also a really nice interface for making repeating tasks that you might want to do daily, like flossing your teeth, as well as one-off to-do item tasks.
</p>
<p>
  It takes a certain kind of nerd, of course, to appreciate this, but that turns out to be case for Beeminder as well.
And it&#8217;s largely the same kind of nerd.
If you&#8217;re a fan of Beeminder there&#8217;s a very good chance you&#8217;ll love HabitRPG as well.
</p>
<p>
  HabitRPG makes habit building intuitive and so much fun that it might seem almost superfluous to beemind your progress.
But of course installing new habits is hard, even if you have a cute cephalopod pet to think of feeding. 
Gamifying the basic building blocks of your life makes it easier to succeed. 
But hard-committing to progress makes it harder to fail, so we&#8217;re really excited to announce our partnership with HabitRPG!
</p>
<h3 id=\\"dive\\">
  Dive In
</h3>
<p>
  So far we&#8217;re just concerned with one direction: Beeminding your HabitRPG usage.
And we&#8217;re starting with just To-Dos, not Habits or Dailies.
We&#8217;ve implemented goals to track your total completed To-Dos or your total uncompleted To-Dos.
</p>
<p>
  Which should you beemind? 
Well, tracking completed To-Dos is nice and straightforward, and beeminding it would add a stick to HabitRPG&#8217;s carrot. 
However, if you tend to let hard things languish and go stale in your To-Do list, then you might do better beeminding To-Dos remaining. 
The danger with minding more completed To-Dos is that you&#8217;ll drum up trivial tasks to keep yourself on track.
The danger with focusing on whittling your remaining To-Dos is that you may be discouraged from adding new tasks.
If both of those sound like dangers for you, beemind both!
</p>
<h3>
  The Future
</h3>
<p>
  The first obvious integration in the other direction is having a HabitRPG habit to enter Beeminder data and automtically get XP (experience points) in HabitRPG for doing so.
Better yet: get XP for maintaining a 7-day safety buffer on a Beeminder goal. 
Alice Harris is doing all sorts of things like that already with her own wizardry with our respective APIs.
</p>
<p>
  And

<h3>
  Known Issues
</h3>
<p>
  We&#8217;ll amend this post when these are fixed but for now, there are two known issues you&#8217;ll want to be careful of:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>
      Don&#8217;t delete any completed To-Dos in HabitRPG if you&#8217;re beeminding total To-Dos completed.
    </strong>
    We&#8217;re not yet robust to that. UPDATE: We&#8217;re going to wait for the HabitRPG folks to implement a new push API that will make this much easier (and better for users as well, since Beeminder will stay in sync with HabitRPG in real time).
  </li>
  <li>
    <s>
      The error-checking is spotty in the goal creation form. Make sure you specify a sane weekly rate of To-Dos.
    </s>
    UPDATE: No known bugs with goal creation now! Let us know if you find any more!
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Got all that? Ok, go!

  Habits are one of the best, and worst, features of being a human.
Habits cause us to do things on autopilot, without thinking or effort.
Because they&#8217;re so powerful, we spend a lot of time working on developing
  <em>
    good
  </em>
  habits. 
Flossing our teeth, arriving at work on time, going to the gym.
</p>
<p>
  When I first discovered
  <a href=\\"http://beeminder.com\\">
    Beeminder
  </a>
  , 
I was delighted, because it meant I could get into the habit of using
  <a
    href=\\"http://ankisrs.net\\"
    title=\\"Anki Spaced Repetition System\\"
  >
    Anki
  </a>
  , 
a fabulous program for loading information into your brain. 
Anki gives you a way of using
  <a
    href=\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition\\"
    title=\\"Spaced repetition is a learning technique that incorporates increasing intervals of time between subsequent review of previously learned material in order to exploit the psychological spacing effect...\\"
  >
    spaced repetition
  </a>
  , 
getting you to recall knowledge just before you&#8217;re about to forget it, and at increasing intervals to make sure it works its way into your long term memory.
</p>
<p>
  I use Anki to remember everything from 
cognitive biases, 
my friends&#8217; food allergies, 
Elvish poetry, 
new and difficult to spell words, 
psychology concepts, 
people, 
and even pop culture and Internet memes.
Anki is free, open source, and there are many pre-existing decks that can be downloaded and used. 
I had also written a basic wrapper to submit data to Beeminder whenever I started Anki on my laptop.
</p>
<p>
  Using Beeminder, I set a goal to use Anki six times per week, and for the next hundred days, I did great.
Since I had a tight schedule, and never built up a large safety buffer, I was always close to falling off the road.
This was great, because it had me integrate Anki into part of my routine; studying Anki cards is what I would do with my second coffee each day.
On days when I&#8217;m travelling or otherwise off my regular routine, there was always the Beeminder email bot to remind me, and I&#8217;d already got into the habit of making sure my Beeminder goals were complete before going to bed. 
Since Anki only takes a few minutes each day, things would go great, even when I had a hectic lifestyle with lots of travel.
</p>
<p>
  However, I then made a dreadful mistake. 
Using Anki every day meant that I was learning
  <em>
    very
  </em>
  effectively; but as a result, the number of cards I had to practice each day had become very small, and it hardly seemed like firing up anki was worth it. 
So I decided, logically enough, that I could retain the knowledge I had learnt with less time expense by only using Anki every
  <em>
    second
  </em>
  day.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;Humans don&#8217;t get into the habit of doing things every second day.&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  While previously the Beeminder emails and my slowly developing habits had me using Anki almost every day, I was now in a position where I could skip days.
But that&#8217;s not how habitualisation
  <em>
    works
  </em>
  .
Humans don&#8217;t get into the habit of doing things every second day. 
Sure enough, by making my goals easier, I upset the habits I was trying to form, and promptly fell off the yellow brick road.
</p>
<p>
  In hindsight, what I should have done &#8212; insteading of dialing down my yellow brick road to match the amount of reviewing I needed to do &#8212; was to commit to using Anki for a minimum amount of time each session.
In the cases where I finished my reviews early, I could use the extra time to review or collate new knowledge.
I could include time spent researching for new cards (for pre-made decks I liked to read about a topic in depth before enabling cards for it).
I could include time spent creating new cards (my deck of interesting people could always do with more work).
If new knowledge felt too hard, then just reviewing cards early could be done to reach my minimum time commitment.
Anything that would have required that I use Anki every day—and felt that daily use was truly beneficial—would have avoided my derailment and inability to form a beneficial habit.
</p>
<p>
  The moral of the story? 
If you actually need Beeminder to get into the habit of doing something, then making goals &#8220;easier&#8221; for you to achieve can actually make them harder once the mechanics of habitualisation come into play.

<p>
  Deadlines are really important.
Without them things don&#8217;t ever get shipped.
But they&#8217;re also &#8212; if you can hard-commit to them, which you have to or else they&#8217;re pointless &#8212; kind of awful and arbitrary and stressful.
</p>
<p>
  Epiphany: Beeminder gives a way to get the key advantage of a deadline without the stress and arbitrariness.
What you do is, instead of &#8220;I hard-commit to finishing X by date D&#8221; you hard-commit to spend half your time on X until it&#8217;s deployed.
It&#8217;s like committing to finish something &#8220;soon&#8221;, but in a way that&#8217;s actually meaningful.
You&#8217;ll be diligently working on it until it&#8217;s done.
</p>
<p>
  I&#8217;ve done this twice so far.

Let me tell you about that last one, as promised at the end of that blog post.

<h3>
  A word from Bee on the $1215 she spent revamping reminders

  ?
Because I paid out $1215 total over the 175 hours and 3 months I spent
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/reminders\\"
    title=\\"Two blog posts ago, announcing the new feature(s)\\"

    href=\\"#INSTI\\"
  >
    [1]
  </a>
  .
Let me assure you, lest you suffer sticker shock on my behalf, that it was well worth the price.
To be sure, I was literally very unlucky with the final $810 derailment &#8212; there was a more than 5 hour TagTime ping gap, which is a rare event, happening less than 1% of the time.

  Even so, compare it to the price I&#8217;d pay to contract out the work to someone else, and it sounds like a steal!
And taking a slightly broader view, there are many of our meta goals 
(

that are literally vital to Beeminder&#8217;s forward progress, and which would not have happened without beeminding them.
Total pledges paid to users on all of those meta goals over multiple years is still just a few thousand dollars! 
A pretty good price for the existence of Beeminder.
And all of that doesn&#8217;t even account for the

  We&#8217;ll start with the non-nerd version.
Last week there was a
  <a
    href=\\"http://xkcd.com/1354\\"
    title=\\"XKCD nails the &#39;simple description of ridiculous software bug&#39; category almost as hard as they nailed your mom last night\\"
  >
    massive security breach
  </a>
  in some very standard software used by most sites on the internet, including Beeminder.
Let us first quickly reassure you that your credit card info gets secured by our much more savvy payment processor,

    href=\\"http://stripe.com/blog/heartbleed\\"
    title=\\"Stripe has a much more impressive postmortem on this disaster than we do\\"
  >
    Stripe
  </a>
  ,
and actually never even touches our servers.
</p>
<p>
  We updated our server the same day the vulnerability was announced, thanks to our friend
  <a
    href=\\"http://fairlystable.org\\"
    title=\\"Joe is a pretty brilliant sysadmin. We highly recommend him.\\"
  >
    Joe Rayhawk
  </a>
  ,
but, being really awful sysadmins ourselves, failed to notice we needed to restart the server to make it take effect.
We did that the next morning when users started letting us know we were still vulnerable (thank you!).
But
  <em>
    then
  </em>
  our server failed to boot back up normally and we spent a couple frantic hours, with help again from Joe, getting it operational.
</p>
<p>
  Then four days later, presumably wholly unrelated, there was a power outage that took out the whole data center where Beeminder is hosted. 
That lasted for 3.5 hours.
</p>
<p>
  In other embarrassing server-related news, there were a couple days last week when many of you were letting us know that you were seeing a lot of your Beeminder emails marked as spam.
We asked our email service provider,
  <a
    href=\\"http://mailgun.com\\"
    title=\\"MailGun has been a godsend for us\\"
  >
    MailGun
  </a>
  ,
for help and they quickly fixed it.
Definitely let us know if you ever see a Beeminder email marked as spam.
That could be pretty devastating for us.
Of course we always reverse derailments that were caused by any kind of technicality like that.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;Bright side: zero data loss!&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  So this has not been a happy week at the beehive.
We were looking back over
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/tag/bugs\\"
    title=\\"For *all* the gory details, see the historical @beemstat tweets\\"
  >
    previous blog posts about our crashes of ineptitude
  </a>
  and see that we failed to blog about our biggest crash of ineptitude of all time, at least as measured in downtime (there are some other doozies in those previous blog posts &#8212; like nearly destroying our database and causing spurious derailments).
That was in November when we had a completely unacceptable 12 hours of downtime as we scrambled to recover after a hard drive failure, wasting precious hours thinking we had the original server repaired only to finally realize we had no choice but to start from scratch on a fresh server. 
(Bright side: zero data loss!)
</p>
<p>
  Suffice it to say, we are hacking our guts out making things more robust.
In the short term that may mean more downtime (as brief as possible!) which we&#8217;ll continue to live-tweet.
Anything major we&#8217;ll first announce on our main twitter account,
  <a
    href=\\"http://twitter.com/bmndr\\"
    title=\\"Insert birds-and-bees joke here\\"
  >
    @bmndr
  </a>
  ,
and point to
  <a
    href=\\"http://twitter.com/beemstat\\"
    title=\\"Again, you don&#39;t need to actually follow this one since @bmndr will point you to it when there are issues\\"
  >
    @beemstat
  </a>
  for details.
(So no need to follow both of them.)
</p>
<p>
  We also want to say how sorry we are about all this.
Especially since the downtime in November should really have been sufficient kick in the pants to improve our infrastructure, at the very least being able to quickly redeploy from scratch on a new server in case of total meltdown at wherever Beeminder happens to be hosted.
And we do appreciate how much you rely on us.
In fact, Bethany&#8217;s reaction to our most recent downtime was pretty funny. 
At some point there was nothing we could do but wait for our hosting provider to restore power and Bethany said, with zero intended irony, 
&#8220;I guess I&#8217;ll check my beeminders to see what else I need to do tonight while we&#8217;re wait- Oh. Right.&#8221;

</h2>
<p>
  For more of the technical details, I&#8217;ll turn this over to our fearless CTO, Bethany Soule.
</p>
<h3>
  Spamboxing
</h3>
<p>
  The IP address our mail was coming from had gotten blacklisted, presumably due to someone else&#8217;s shenanigans.
MailGun switched our IP and it seems to have solved the problem.
</p>
<h3>
  Power Outage
</h3>
<p>
  Saturday night a meteor full of zombies hit Newark and they gnawed through intertubes connecting our servers to the world wide web!
</p>
<p>
  That didn&#8217;t really happen. 
But Linode&#8217;s entire Newark data center had a power outage and apparently a UPS failure along with it. 
Because power was totally out to the entire data center, and because of our current deployment architecture (ha! that&#8217;s just a fancy way to say &#8220;We&#8217;re running all of Beeminder&#8217;s components off the same physical (virtual) machine&#8221;) there was little we could do to recover without losing data back to our latest backup, which was over 12 hours old. 
[UPDATE: To clarify, we suffered through the downtime so as
  <em>
    not
  </em>
  to have to restore from backup. So no data was actually lost!]
</p>
<h3>
  Heartbleed
</h3>
<p>
  Our servers run Ubuntu Linux and indeed were vulnerable to the Heartbleed bug for however long it&#8217;s been out there in the wild. 
We patched our libraries within several hours of Ubuntu releasing their updated packages, but failed to restart nginx to reload the updated libraries. 
We went to bed blissful in our ignorance of our ignorance. 
When you guys started emailing us in the morning we were no longer ignorant of our ignorance, but we were however still ignorant of what in the world was wrong with our filesystem after updating the packages the day before. 
The server is running, and not vulnerable to heartbleed, but it&#8217;s somewhat hobbled at the moment. 
Which brings me to my next point.
</p>
<h3>
  Getting better
</h3>
<p>
  Aside from the immediate clean-up from this latest failure, we are (with help from our
  <a
    href=\\"http://aaronparecki.com\\"
    title=\\"Aaron Parecki\\"
  >
    savvier friends
  </a>
  ) 
making Beeminder robust at the very least to experiencing this exact failure again. 
We&#8217;re hard at work writing and testing an actual deploy script for setting up a new copy of the Beeminder web server seamlessly and much more quickly than previously. 
We&#8217;re also setting up database redundancy using Mongo&#8217;s replica sets so that if our server&#8217;s datacenter goes AWOL we can quickly fail over to the replica.

  It turns out that learning a language is a bit like hiking all 2,200 miles of the Appalacian trial: it sounds like something that only a talented elite could do. 
But all you really need is the ability to keep putting one foot in front of another for 6 or 7 months.
Couch potatoes have hiked the trail &#8212; as well as a

Language learning is the same way: 
If you can stick with it long enough, you&#8217;ll get there.
Sheer stubborn persistence is a superpower.
</p>
<p>
  Now, when I learned French, I had the luxury of being totally committed.
I spoke it with my wife.
I read 500 pages of French a month for 20 months.
I bought the French dubs of

  and
  <em>

  and watched season after season.
It was easy for me to stay motivated, because I was obsessed.
</p>
<p>
  But when I decided to learn Egyptian, I was faced with a dilemma: 
I couldn&#8217;t justify spending more than an hour per week on it.
Hierogylphs are cool, but come on &#8212; it&#8217;s a dead language.
Unfortunately, it&#8217;s hard to learn a language in slow motion, because two things always go wrong:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>
      I get distracted, and I never actually put in that hour per week.
    </strong>
    You&#8217;re reading this on the Beeminder blog, so you can already guess how I&#8217;m handling this.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      I forget everything I learn between lessons.
    </strong>
    Fortunately, I already knew about
    <a
      href=\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition\\"
      title=\\"If you are forced to recall something right before you would have forgotten it, you will generally remember at least twice as long the next time. This is almost magic.\\"

  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  So how does this work in practice?
</p>
<h2>
  Picking a course and setting a goal
</h2>
<p>
  My favorite language courses are made by Assimil, a family-owned French company.
These courses are great for beeminding, because each lesson takes 20 to 40 minutes, and I can mostly just soak up the language through osmosis.
Assimil publishes
  <a
    href=\\"http://en.assimil.com/\\"
    title=\\"You can order these online from Amazon. Get the MP3 CDs (if available) and the book. But check the ISBN numbers carefully.\\"
  >
    quite a few language courses for English speakers
  </a>
  , but in this case, I grabbed
  <a
    href=\\"http://fr.assimil.com/methodes/l-egyptien-hieroglyphique--456\\"
    title=\\"An introductory course based on learning by reading parallel texts in French and Egyptian. Sort of like the original Rosetta stone, but much easier and it has more footnotes.\\"
  >
    <em>

  </a>
  out of their French catalog.
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"ENGLISH1\\"
    href=\\"#ENGLISH\\"
  >
    [4]
  </a>
  The English version of this course isn&#8217;t expected to come out before 2015, and I wanted an excuse to practice my French.
</p>
<p>
  <img

    src=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/egyptien_and_wand.jpg\\"
  >
</p>
<p>
  Normally, I&#8217;d study one Assimil lesson per day.
But this time,
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/emk/goals/egyptien\\"
    title=\\"My actual Beeminder goal. Free free to help keep me accountable.\\"
  >
    my goal
  </a>
  is to study one lesson per week:

<p>
  <img
    class=\\"aligncenter\\"
    alt=\\"Eric's (live) Beeminder graph\\"
    title=\\"This is Eric's live graph. Hopefully it won't embarrass him later! --ed\\"
    src=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/emk/goals/egyptien/graph\\"
  >
</p>
<p>
  Beeminder is in charge of letting me know when I&#8217;m in danger of dropping below my goal.
I find this enormously helpful, because at a rate of one lesson per week, I have no intrinsic momentum or habits to keep me going.
</p>
<h2>
  Anki, the memory amplifier
</h2>
<p>
  <a
    href=\\"http://ankisrs.net/\\"
    title=\\"First-rate open source flashcard software which implements spaced repetition.\\"
  >
    Anki
  </a>
  is my favorite flashcard software.
It implements
  <a
    href=\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition\\"
    title=\\"If you are forced to recall something right before you would have forgotten it, you will generally remember at least twice as long the next time. This is almost magic.\\"
  >
    spaced repetition
  </a>
  , which means that I don&#8217;t have to waste any more time than necessary on a given card.
There&#8217;s an open source desktop version, a slightly pricey

    href=\\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ankisrs/id373493387?mt=8\\"

    title=\\"Anki client for Android. This is maintained by a group of open source developers and it&#39;s free.\\"
  >
    open source app for Android users
  </a>
  .
Anki supports robust syncing, plugins, images and audio.
Using Anki, I have few problems remembering what I&#8217;ve learned between lessons.
</p>
<p>
  Since I&#8217;m lazy, and I refuse to waste any time on data entry, I&#8217;m using images of the pages.
You can make these using a cell phone camera or a scanner wand.
Of course, it would be ideal if I could buy a PDF of my language course and just copy and paste.
</p>
<p>
  Once I have an image, I paste a section of the Assimil lesson into an image editor:
</p>
<p>
  <img
    class=\\"aligncenter\\"
    alt=\\"Assimil snippets in an image editor\\"
    title=\\"Assimil snippets in an image editor\\"
    src=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Cloze_Step1.png\\"
  >
</p>
<p>
  This comes from a short story about a light-fingered monkey that steals a girl&#8217;s necklace.
In English, it would read:
</p>
<div style=\\"padding-left:2.5em\\">
  <p>
    <strong>
      A difficult moment (bad moment)
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    It really is a thief.
    <br>
    <i>
      (&#8220;Truly&#8221;-he as-a thief in truth)
    </i>
  </p>
  <p>
    Look, I&#8217;m sad!
    <br>
    <i>
      (Look, heart-me in sadness)
    </i>
  </p>
</div>
<p>
  Once I&#8217;ve assembled the image, I open the Anki
  <a
    href=\\"http://tmbb.bitbucket.org/image-occlusion-2.html\\"
    title=\\"This is great for learning visual information. You wouldn&#39;t necessarily need it for a language you can type easily.\\"
  >
    Image Occlusion Plugin
  </a>
  , and paste it in:
</p>
<p>
  <img
    class=\\"aligncenter\\"
    alt=\\"Assimil snippets in Image Occlusion plugin\\"
    title=\\"Assimil snippets in Image Occlusion plugin\\"
    src=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Cloze_Step2.png\\"
  >
</p>
<p>
  The next step is to block out various unfamiliar parts of the text.
Sometimes I block out the transliteration of the hieroglyphs;
sometimes I block out half a word on both the hieroglyph and transliteration lines.
Basically, I want these occlusions to be ridiculously easy.
I&#8217;ve found that easy Anki cards work just as well as hard ones, and I can review them a lot quicker, and with a lot more pleasure, so why not?
(This technique was inspired by Khatzumoto&#8217;s
  <a
    href=\\"http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/12-free-mcd-examples\\"
    title=\\"How to make good &#39;cloze&#39;, or fill-in-the-blank cards. Khatzumoto also sells in an-depth tutorial with lots of examples in multiple languages.\\"

    title=\\"Portions of hieroglyphics and transliteration hidden\\"
    src=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Cloze_Step3.png\\"
  >
</p>
<p>
  Now, I save the results to Anki (using the overlapping squares button).
This will make a separate card for each occlusion.
Here&#8217;s a preview of the front and the back of one of the resulting cards:
</p>
<p>
  <img
    class=\\"aligncenter\\"

    src=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/ClozeStep4Horizontal.png\\"
  >
</p>
<p>
  To pass this card, all I need to do is guess what&#8217;s under the red bit.
One nice thing about this process:
I can easily make multiple cards from the same material.
</p>
<h2>
  Don&#8217;t let Anki turn you into a quivering ball of stress!
</h2>
<p>
  Unfortunately, I&#8217;ve seen lots of people make themselves thoroughly miserable using spaced repetition software.
Here are a few tips that have worked very well for me:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    I spend as little time on data entry as humanly possible. Think &#8220;copy and paste&#8221;, not &#8220;artisinally craft perfect cards.&#8221;
  </li>
  <li>
    I make
    <a
      href=\\"http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/12-free-mcd-examples\\"
      title=\\"How to make good &#39;cloze&#39;, or fill-in-the-blank cards. Khatzumoto also sells in an-depth tutorial with lots of examples in multiple languages.\\"
    >
      multiple, very easy cards from the same material
    </a>
    .
  </li>
  <li>
    I configure Anki to introduce no more than 5 new cards per day, and my daily reviews rarely go above 10–25 cards.
As a rule of thumb, if you introduce X new cards per day, you should be prepared to review at least 5X, and maybe 10X.
Give Anki a month of steady use before getting ambitious.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a card is hard, boring or annoying, I just
    <a
      href=\\"http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/is-your-srs-deck-a-clean-house\\"
      title=\\"An article on card deletion, and why it&#39;s good for your deck. Seriously, if you delete annoying cards, your life will be vastly more enjoyable. Do not let perfectionist tendencies drown you here.\\"
    >
      delete it
    </a>
    .
This saves me from endlessly reviewing the same 50 horrible cards.
And if I need to know something, I&#8217;ll see it again at some point.
  </li>
  <li>
    I don&#8217;t stress out about the &#8220;right&#8221; way to cloze things.
I try all sorts of different ideas.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  As you can see, I&#8217;m not using Anki to &#8220;permanently memorize&#8221; things.
I&#8217;m using to amplify my natural memory considerably, but I still forget obscure things and delete cards.
And that&#8217;s OK.

  What else could you beemind?

    Once you get good enough to follow 40% of the dialog in a TV series, things get fun.
At this point, you should be able to buy a DVD box set of an easy TV series, and start watching.
The first episodes may require subtiles and multiple viewings.
But within a season or two, you should see dramatic listening gains.
TV series are especially good for this, because they have pictures to provide context, and because they have hours and hours of conversations between the same cast members about the same topics, providing much-needed training wheels.

  Conclusion
</h2>
<p>
  I&#8217;m having a ton of fun beeminding my Egyptian.
Thanks to Anki, I have an unusually good memory. 
And thanks to Beeminder, I have an unusually good ability to study one lesson per week without that trailing off to zero lessons per week. 
And that&#8217;s one way to learn the basics of an obscure language really slowly, but quite pleasantly, over the course of a couple of years.

Yes, you can now gift your honey money (FKA premium credit), even to people who don&#8217;t yet have a Beeminder account (give the gift of Beeminder?).
It looks like this:

  If you put an email address in the &#8220;To&#8221; field instead of a Beeminder username, that person will be notified, we&#8217;ll help get them set up, and then transfer the honey to them.
If they fail to get set up, you keep your honey.
Or if they happen to already have a Beeminder account, the honey will transfer to them instantly.

  Wait, what&#8217;s Honey Money again?
</h3>
<p>
  It&#8217;s Beeminder&#8217;s new currency and a way to pre-pay for derailments.
It also generalizes the old premium credit feature.
We&#8217;ve just now added a

<h3>
  Backstory
</h3>
<p>
  We&#8217;ve been experimenting with this as a hidden beta feature for a while and have been slow to announce it more widely because it&#8217;s involved kind rewriting all our backend code that deals with payments and premium credit.
There&#8217;s a lot more to say about it and we intend additional blog posts.
For now we&#8217;ll focus on why we built this.
</p>
<p>
  In the beginning there was premium premium credit&#8230;
</p>
<p>
  We&#8217;ve long used premium credit for bounties or thank-yous or apologies, or occasionally as refunds.
Also student discounts and similar. 
You can see the

    href=\\"https://help.beeminder.com/article/244-premium-credit\\"
    title=\\"How does premium credit work?\\"
  >
    gory details in our help doc
  </a>
  or the
  <a
    href=\\"http://doc.bmndr.co/credit\\"
    title=\\"Spec: Premium Credit\\"
  >
    even gorier details
  </a>
  in our internal spec from which we implemented it.
</p>
<p>
  Honey Money is the same thing but can also, optionally, work for derailments. 
It&#8217;s a way to prepay for a derailment by depositing money with Beeminder before you actually derail. 
When you derail we draw from that balance first before charging your credit card.
</p>
<p>
  (Of course users shouldn&#8217;t have to care about this, if they want to just give us a payment method like usual to be charged whenever they derail.
If someone does somehow end up with honey money they don&#8217;t want applied to derailments, we intend to keep that as an option.)
</p>
<p>
  Anyway, we ended up accumulating a whole list of reasons we wanted people to at least have the option to prepay for derailments:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    As a signup filter, we may want to only let you sign up if you&#8217;re serious enough and
    <a
      href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/nailingit\\"
      title=\\"Derailing It Is Nailing It\\"
    >
      philosophically on board
    </a>
    enough to be fine with prepaying $5.
  </li>
  <li>
    (Also potentially it matters for anti-fraud to have a big enough initial deposit required to deter testing of stolen credit cards.)
  </li>
  <li>
    Beyond signup, it can be a way to encourage the derailing-it-is-nailing-it mindset: 
&#8220;Of course it&#8217;s fine to put in honey money up front &#8212; eventually you&#8217;ll use it. If you don&#8217;t you&#8217;re doing it wrong!&#8221;
  </li>
  <li>
    To support payment methods that don&#8217;t support arbitrary future charges 
(cf.
    <a
      href=\\"https://stripe.com/docs/india-recurring-payments\\"
      title=\\"This has been a bit of a bugbear for us in support\\"
    >
      the situation in India
    </a>
    in particular).
  </li>
  <li>
    To close the loophole (at least for people who want to close it for themselves) where you deauthorize Beeminder&#8217;s access to your payment method before we charge it.
  </li>
  <li>
    To be able to pay bounties to users or issue refunds by adding to your honey balance. 
Especially if premium plans go away in the future and already for the case of lifetime premium people or people who never intend to get premium.
We&#8217;ve been doing a lot with premium credit but
    <a
      href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/focus\\"
      title=\\"Strategy Memo: Beeminder Is Pledge-Focused\\"
    >
      want to keep gradually moving away from premium plans
    </a>
    so generalizing to derail credit helps with that.
  </li>
  <li>
    To reduce the amount of refunds we do ($50k/year last we checked).
  </li>
  <li>
    To keep from throwing PayPal users under the bus 
(Stripe even
    <a
      href=\\"https://stripe.com/docs/payments/paypal\\"
      title=\\"See &#39;Accept a payment&#39; and &#39;Set up future payments&#39; in the sidebar -- apparently the latter is not yet available for US businesses\\"
    >
      supports PayPal
    </a>
    now for one-off payments to US businesses).
  </li>
  <li>
    As probably the easiest way to support paying for derailments via in-app purchase on iOS.
  </li>
  <li>
    We could save credit card processing fees and other overhead/risk by doing bigger charges less frequently.
Honey money (that&#8217;s allowed to go negative?) may be the most elegant implementation of this.
  </li>
  <li>
    The integration with our friends at
    <a
      href=\\"https://manifold.markets\\"
      title=\\"Play-money prediction market\\"
    >
      Manifold
    </a>
    where mana and honey can be exchanged!
  </li>
  <li>
    We&#8217;re doing a science experiment in collaboration with the University of Virginia and needed a way for students to use Beeminder without putting in their own credit cards.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Of course it&#8217;s the last one that kicked us out of maybe-someday mode.
</p>
<p>
  So there you have it.
Honey Money is now the coin of the realm.

<p>
  Sometimes Beeminder goals have loopholes, like you could dehydrate yourself to get your datapoint below the bright line on your weight-loss graph (please don&#8217;t!). 
There are plenty of things like that and I probably shouldn&#8217;t think too hard about more examples. 
Sometimes loopholes like that can ruin a goal. 
But other times, ironically, such loopholes can be so blatant that they&#8217;re in no danger at all of ruining the goal. 
We call the latter
  <em>
    ice cream truck loopholes
  </em>
  . 
As in a loophole so big you could drive an ice cream truck through it. 
Could but won&#8217;t. 
You know that your Beeminder goal would be ruined the moment you exploited it, and so you&#8217;re not tempted to.
It&#8217;s like a slope so slippery you&#8217;re not tempted to so much as set foot on it.
</p>
<h2 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;Simply beemind touching the door of your gym&#8217;s building&#8221;
</h2>
<p>
  The original example of such a loophole was from the first incarnation of the
  <a
    href=\\"http://beeminder.com/contract\\"
    title=\\"This is pretty out of date and not as relevant to current Beeminder\\"
  >
    Beeminder commitment contract
  </a>
  back when we thought we needed an elaborate, literal commitment contract. 
We suggested that, to avoid fuzziness around the definition of &#8220;going to the gym&#8221;, you could simply beemind touching the door of your gym&#8217;s building. 
If you were legitimately injured or something and shouldn&#8217;t exercise, the loophole would be there for the taking. 
But otherwise you&#8217;d never be so lazy that you&#8217;d actually get yourself all the way to the door of the gym and then not go in. 
I mean, some people might. 
It depends on where exactly the akrasia is. 
Is the workout itself hard to make yourself do or is it just overcoming the inertia of getting out the door?
</p>
<p>
  And that&#8217;s the point: thou knowest thyself.
You can&#8217;t predict every loophole but for a given loophole you can predict whether it will ruin your goal.
</p>
<h2>
  Goodhart&#8217;s Law
</h2>
<p>
  One aspect of this, which we&#8217;ve
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/unintended/\\"
    title=\\"It might be time to rewrite that post to focus on Goodhart&#39;s law specifically\\"
  >
    talked about before
  </a>
  , is that Beeminder is surprisingly robust to Goodhart&#8217;s law.
Goodhart&#8217;s law states that any metric you try to optimize quickly becomes meaningless because people game the living crap out of it (that&#8217;s how I state it anyway).
Our point with ice cream truck loopholes is that that doesn&#8217;t apply to a single person the way it applies in organizations.
If you pay your employees based on how much time they spend at the office or how many lines of code they write, that may well be a Goodhartian disaster.
</p>
<p>
  But for you personally, beeminding the amount of time you spend, say, at the gym, or outdoors, might well be highly aligned with your big picture goals &#8212; health, exercise, socializing. 
And you&#8217;re always ready to adjust if not.
The feedback loop is tight and the incentives stay in line.
Which makes sense: you&#8217;re the one constructing the incentives and also the one being incentivized.
Goodhart&#8217;s law specifically depends on that not being the case.
</p>
<h2>
  Examples
</h2>
<p>
  We&#8217;ve talked about ice cream truck loopholes with users from day one and have collected a few examples.
Here&#8217;s one, paraphrased, from someone writing a book:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    I get an automatic +1 via RSS for each chapter.
The (mostly) ice cream truck loophole is breaking it up into ever finer sub-chapters.
I&#8217;ve abused that loophole just slightly, and rarely.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Another user said they&#8217;ve used the &#8220;check in at the gym without working out&#8221; loophole only once in two years and hasn&#8217;t been tempted otherwise.
</p>
<p>
  Here&#8217;s one for household chores:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    My metric for my to-do list goal is touching the item in question. 
For example, I could just move my laundry basket and get a +1 for doing the laundry. 
I&#8217;m not tempted to exploit it because I do actually want the laundry done, but if there&#8217;s a reason I
    <em>
      can&#8217;t
    </em>
    do the laundry (like not enough hot water) then I&#8217;m happy to use the loophole.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  A couple months ago we had a kind of
&#8220;
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/meta/\\"
    title=\\"Irony alert. The linked post here purports to be a dummy post to keep Beeminder happy but includes multiple paragraphs, a carefully curated list, a custom title image, and even a fancy button. Oh yeah, and it announced a big upgrade, for mobile-friendliness.\\"

  convinced us on Twitter, it&#8217;s not necessarily a ruinous loophole that you can mash your keyboard and hit publish to technically satisfy your blogging goal.
If you define a blog post as &#8220;anything I&#8217;m not embarrassed to publish&#8221; and a small number of dummy posts meet that criterion then the system is working as designed.
Presumably without Beeminder you&#8217;d let the blog go totally moribund, so it&#8217;s still a huge win.
If you do start posting dummy posts one after another, you&#8217;ll restructure the goal (Beeminder lets you do that &#8212; you just need a week of lead time for any changes, including ending the goal altogether).
</p>
<p>
  Finally, here&#8217;s an example from an old post of ours on what we dubbed
&#8220;
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/waisted/\\"
    title=\\"It&#39;s a reference to &#39;The Clean Plate Club&#39;, a PSA campaign about not wasting food\\"
  >
    The Dirty Plate Club
  </a>
  &#8221; in which we propose a way to break the habit of unthinkingly finishing all the food on your plate.
Taking it to our characteristic extremes, we advocated a strict rule of leaving some food left over at every meal.
A common reaction was to point out the loophole of overloading your plate to make it easy to follow the dirty plate club rule.
But, you guessed it, that&#8217;s an ice cream truck loophole.
</p>
<p>
  If you wanted to thwart the system, that would be a great way to thwart it.
But you want the system to work.
That&#8217;s why you&#8217;re adopting it in the first place.
</p>
<p>
  We&#8217;re not saying you don&#8217;t have to worry about loopholes and other ways your nicely quantified, graphable Beeminder goals can be at odds with your true underlying goals.
Just that the glaring, blatant loopholes tend not to be the ones you need to worry about.

  Announcement! 
There is now an official Beeminder Channel on IFTTT! 
This is a big day for us.
Our users have been begging for this for a very long time, and we in turn have been bugging IFTTT. 
In fact, Danny even wrote this Ode to IFTTT two years ago and included it in our application to be a channel partner:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    There was a web service called IFTTT.
    <br>
    &#8216;Twas a veritable paradigm shift.
    <br>
    Spreading web automation
    <br>
    Across the whole nation!
    <br>
    If they reject us we&#8217;ll feel pretty miffed&#8230;
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  So this has been a long time in the works.
</p>
<p>
  If you don&#8217;t know what Beeminder&#8217;s about, welcome! 
Beeminder helps you get things done by having you put your money where your mouth is. 
That means you pledge money to stay on track towards your goals, and we send you reminders and graph your progress along a Yellow Brick Road. 
But if you fall behind then we take your money. 
Long-time Beeminder users find that those stings (get it?) are well worth it for all the awesomeness we induce the rest of the time. 
But if the thought of having to pay money is too scary, that&#8217;s perfect: you&#8217;ll be very motivated to keep all your datapoints on your yellow brick road. 
We don&#8217;t even ask for a credit card until the first time you go off track.
</p>
<p>
  In case you haven&#8217;t heard of IFTTT before, here&#8217;s a quick rundown. 
IFTTT stands for &#8220;If This Then That&#8221;. 
It&#8217;s a service that lets you connect two different web services or apps together using Recipes that follow an &#8220;if this happens&#8221; then &#8220;do that&#8221; formula. 
You pick a Trigger &#8212; new instragram photo, rain forecast, you name it &#8212; and IFTTT will do some specified Action whenever the triggering event happens.
</p>
<p>
  So, say you beemind going to the gym. 
If you install the IFTTT app on your phone then you can use your location as an IFTTT Trigger when you go to the gym. 
Next you pick an Action. 
In this case you&#8217;d pick Beeminder and have IFTTT add a datapoint to your gym goal on Beeminder every time you go there. 
Automatically.

  This Beeminder Channel on IFTTT means easier automation of more stuff that you use &#8212; without waiting on us to get new integrations out.
Automating data entry makes it possible to beemind more stuff with less tedium/friction. 
Not to mention that it&#8217;s the best way to reduce the

  .
</p>
<h3>
  Triggers
</h3>
<p>
  Most of you care about the next section &#8212; Actions &#8212; but for hardcore Beeminder users, 
we implemented two basic kinds of Triggers in the Beeminder Channel as well.
The first triggers whenever a new datapoint is added to one of your goals.
You can monitor just one specific goal, or all of your active goals at once.
We&#8217;ve seen people logging every Beeminder datapoint to a spreadsheet, or copying data from one Beeminder goal to another.
</p>
<p>
  We also have a couple of &#8220;you&#8217;re getting close to derailing&#8221; Triggers.
These will trigger when your goal is on an eep day, or you can specify how close is too close and we will trigger when you have N days left.
</p>
<p>
  Here&#8217;s a Recipe for adding iOS reminders when your Beeminder goals get close to derailing.

  If you squint hard enough you
  <em>
    could
  </em>
  call all of those commitment devices.
But instead we can think of it as a continuum.
Say you&#8217;re Ulysses and your undesired action is steering your ship into rocks due to siren songs.
At one extreme &#8212; an unambiguous commitment device &#8212; you can tie yourself to the mast to directly remove the undesired action from your possible actions.
At the other extreme you can get, say, another boat to go in front of you with pictures of puppies on it so you&#8217;re less tempted to steer toward the sirens.
</p>
<p>
  The commonality is that you&#8217;re altering the tradeoffs between your possible future actions, making your short-term incentives (sweet, sweet sirens) better match your long-term incentives (not crashing into rocks).
</p>
<p>
  In conclusion, commitment devices are the subclass of incentive alignment in which you make undesired actions more costly for your future self.
(Removing possible actions altogether we can think of as making those actions infinitely costly.)
Incentive alignment more generally refers to any adjustment to your own future incentives to make your desired actions more rewarding relative to your undesired actions.

  about beeminding outside the box:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    I especially love beeminding hobbies because it is both an enforcement and an excuse. 
I beemind my craft projects because sometimes I don&#8217;t spend enough time on them, but when I come to an emergency day it&#8217;s wonderfully liberating to sit down without any guilt. 
Maybe there are other things that seem more important, like if I&#8217;m not playing with the kids or working on Beeminder maybe I
    <em>
      should
    </em>
    be cleaning the bathroom or folding laundry, for some values of should. 
But it turns out those are usually pretty stupid values of should and if I have an emergency craft day, well, I conveniently planned last week that crafting would be the most urgent and important thing today. 
I can sit down without guilt and spend 25 minutes knitting because I want to and because I have to.

<p>
  Not to get superstitious but every time we blog about some shameful bout of ineptitude, something equally embarrassing happens while we&#8217;re writing it up.
Last time, while writing about how
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/mongo\\">
    we accidentally deleted a random slice of our database
  </a>
  , 
we added a footnote about accidentally marking all goals as temporary test goals that automatically delete themselves.
</p>
<p>
  This time, with uncanny parallelism, we found that, weeks ago, when
  <a
    href=\\"https://twitter.com/beemuvi/status/260853130655309825\\"
    title=\\"Not sure if it was this improvement in particular, but something like this\\"
  >
    adding more fanciness
  </a>
  to our goal creation wizard, we started silently
  <em>
    ignoring
  </em>
  the &#8220;temporary test goal&#8221; setting.
So not nearly as bad as the other way around, but especially embarrassing this time because
  <a href=\\"http://guidetogradschoolsurvival.wordpress.com/2013/01/09/pomodoro-applescript/\\">
    one of our favorite beemindees
  </a>
  alerted us over a week ago and we just shrugged it off as PEBKAC and deleted their goal manually.
We even had our own suspicions when meaning to create test goals (which we do a lot) but always assumed we must&#8217;ve forgotten to check that box!
</p>
<p>
  So

    now it&#8217;s fixed

  </a>

(Well, one question asked: &#8220;Do you promise you meant it to be a temporary test goal?&#8221;)
</p>
<h2>
  Nerds Only Beyond This Point
</h2>
<p>
  As promised, here are the gory details of that money-eating bug.
First, as background, we delay charges for 24 hours after derailment for logistical reasons. 
If there&#8217;s cause to cancel the charge (and sometimes there is!) we save hassle/fees if we haven&#8217;t actually charged the credit card yet. 
We implemented this using
  <a href=\\"https://github.com/bvandenbos/resque-scheduler\\">
    resque_scheduler
  </a>
  &#8217;s delayed jobs, and queuing up a job at time of derailment to process the charge in 24 hours. 
Then if the derailment was not legit, we remove the job from the delayed queue.
</p>
<p>
  <a href=\\"https://github.com/defunkt/resque\\">
    Resque
  </a>
  relies on string comparison of JSON-encoded hashes to find and delete a delayed item. 
It uses a hash of the parameters you passed in when you queued it, but in Ruby 1.8 hashes are unordered.
So sometimes the string that Redis (Resque&#8217;s keystore) gives has the parameters in a different order than the string that Resque constructs when you call remove_delayed, so despite knowing the timestamp it was delayed for and the exact parameters of the delayed job, you get a false negative on comparison, and Resque won&#8217;t remove it!
</p>
<p>
  Now, Resque returns the number of deleted jobs, but we weren&#8217;t checking the return value, and so sometimes the charge job would remain on queue and go through despite our intent to have canceled it.
</p>
<p>
  We ultimately worked around this problem by removing Resque from the equation and adding a key to our pledge model for the timestamp of the pending charge. 
Then we have a sweeper that runs regularly and looks for pledges whose pending charges have come due.
This also makes it simpler to know if a particular charge has been canceled already without digging through Redis and introspecting on the queues.
</p>
<p>
  Here&#8217;s the Github issue &#8212;
  <a href=\\"https://github.com/bvandenbos/resque-scheduler/issues/47\\">
    https://github.com/bvandenbos/resque-scheduler/issues/47
  </a>
  &#8212; and we&#8217;ll update this post when it&#8217;s fixed.
(UPDATE: That GitHub issue says it was fixed a year later.)
Of course, even if we hadn&#8217;t worked around it, it should be moot in Ruby 1.9.

  Here&#8217;s what we landed on after much hand-wringing and internal debate:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    Tenet the first: 
You can still use Beeminder for free.
  </strong>
  (Assuming you keep your datapoints on track, of course.)
And not a crippled or time-limited trial version, but real beeminding.

  >
    [2]
  </a>
  , yes, but not a paywall.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    Tenet the second: 
We want to get most serious users onto a paid plan.
  </strong>
  If you are getting noticeable value from Beeminder, it should be a no-brainer to at least get on the cheapest paid plan.
We&#8217;re calling that plan Infinibee because we decided to use the number of active goals 
(technically goals in your gallery, whether or not they&#8217;re actually active)
as the simplest proxy for how much value you&#8217;re getting.
</p>
<p>
  [UPDATE: We meant to say number of goals you create, not just active goals. 
In the meantime we decided active goals is probably better. 
We&#8217;ll delete this update when &#8220;active&#8221; is actually true.]
  <br>
  [FURTHER UPDATE: We waited so long to actually do that &#8212; till new year&#8217;s eve 2020! &#8212; that we now feel weird silently deleting the previous update.
So we won&#8217;t.
But it&#8217;s now finally true that we count the number of goals in your gallery, not ever-created goals!]
</p>
<p>
  Subscribing to Infinibee gives you an unlimited number of goals &#8212; otherwise limited to 3 &#8212; of any type except custom.
Starting now, the free plan limits you to Do More goals, weight goals, and any

The full list of autodata sources is on the Beeminder front page or at the bottom of beeminder.com/services.\\"

  goals using our integration partners.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    Tenet the third: 
Power user features go in the middle plan.
  </strong>
  Some features take a lot of time and effort to build and maintain. 
Auto-ratcheting, weekends off, and fully custom goals, to name a few.
But they&#8217;re really good features if you&#8217;re a hard-core Beeminder user.
Not surprising since we built a lot of them for ourselves or based directly on feedback from you.
They&#8217;re not essential to basic beeminding (tracking your goals with the credible threat of charging you money) and can even be counter-productive to show to newbees. 
We&#8217;re calling this middle plan Bee Plus, because it gets you these power user features on top of the core Beeminder service.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    Tenet the fourth: 
Revenue-impacting features go in the expensive plan.
  </strong>
  Some people hear about Beeminder and say &#8220;that would be really cool if only it did X&#8221;, where X is something that would mean that Beeminder wouldn&#8217;t make any money and therefore wouldn&#8217;t be around for that person to use it.
The three most common values of X are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    &#8220;If only I could choose the starting pledge! 
(And set it to something really high so that it&#8217;s immediately so motivating that I never derail)&#8221;
  </li>
  <li>
    &#8220;If only I could just use it to track my goals without this silly pledging business!&#8221;
  </li>
  <li>
    &#8220;If only I could have the money go to charity!&#8221;
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The first two have been premium features for a long time.
Today we&#8217;ve added a partial charity option.
We&#8217;ll continue to call this plan Beemium: it&#8217;s the fanciest plan and includes everything in Infinibee and Bee Plus as well.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;All your existing goals are grandfathered&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  <strong>
    Tenet the fifth: People who are currently subscribers should be happy about any changes.
  </strong>
  Existing premium subscribers can keep their current plans as they are indefinitely and, as thank-you for supporting us early, we&#8217;ll be sending you discount coupons for the new plans.
(And even if you&#8217;re not already on a premium plan, all your existing goals are grandfathered.)
</p>
<p>
  So, with those tenets of liberté, égalité, and fraternité, let&#8217;s talk about the new Beeminder premium plans.
</p>
<h3>
  A Couple Carrots After All
</h3>
<p>
  Actually, we should first mention a tenet that got thrown under the bus.
Well, a little bit under the bus.
Thrown under a bicycle maybe.
Remember our
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/premium#nocarrots\\"
    title=\\"This is a section of our original announcement of premium plans, in 2013\\"
  >
    No Dangling Carrots Principle
  </a>
  ?
Most of you don&#8217;t, since that was over three years ago.
But back when we first introduced premium plans we wrote &#8220;we do not intend to hold important features as dangling carrots.&#8221;
Well, here we are, dangling carrots in front of you.
Not many.
Mainly the carrot of unlimited goals.
And the weekends-off feature is probably a violation of No Dangling Carrots, since it&#8217;s just a checkbox.
We can&#8217;t claim that one&#8217;s too confusing for newbees.
</p>
<p>
  What do we have to say for ourselves?
Well, like Beeminder, reality is a harsh mistress.
At the beginning of 2016 we hard-committed to making Beeminder revenue grow by the end of the year so Beeminder can keep existing for many years to come.
This is part of that plan.
</p>
<p>
  But enough of that, let&#8217;s talk about these plans!

<h3>
  Infinibee ($8/month)

<p>
  This is the plan that we hope is a no-brainer if you&#8217;ve read this far.
It has all of core Beeminder and no limit to number of goals and types of goals.

<p>
  We&#8217;re quite proud of our auto-canceling subscription feature (which applies to all plans).
If $8/month had you on the fence we hope that not having to worry about remembering to cancel (should Beeminder somehow fail to enthrall you) will push you right off.
And especially if you&#8217;re a startup founder yourself we hope you&#8217;ll

  This is the power user plan.
The fanciest fanciness is here, things that might confuse newbees or matter to the most hard core folks.

Beemium subscribers are highly akratic and have the foresight to know what will motivate them.
We&#8217;re highly akratic, no question there, but we&#8217;re always a bit delusional about it.

  How do you induce someone to take needed medication who 
(1) doesn&#8217;t consider their personal health a priority, 
(2) is not sure they even want to deal with their condition, 
(3) is not always convinced of the value of medication, and 
(4) lacks confidence in their doctor? 
The answer is: patient education. 
For every one of those obstacles, there&#8217;s no shortcut. 
But this challenge is about an even deeper problem, exemplified by the patient who claims 
their personal health is indeed a priority, 
very much wants to deal with their condition, 
has no doubts about the value of their prescribed treatments, 
has full confidence in their doctor, 
and yet
  <em>
    still
  </em>
  fails to comply, simply because their good intentions fall by the wayside.
</p>
<p>
  This problem goes far beyond compliance with medication. 
Many of us have a problem following through on our intentions in all aspects of life. 
And it&#8217;s more than just a difficulty in predicting our future desires. 
It&#8217;s not that you say to yourself, &#8220;Gee, I thought I wanted to get in shape but it turned out there was always something really good on TV!&#8221; 
No, even in hindsight, you regret not doing what you said you wanted to do. 
It&#8217;s not even that you&#8217;re merely conflicted about what you want. 
The trade-off you made &#8212; more TV watched, still not in shape &#8212; was patently ridiculous. 
You somehow don&#8217;t do what you genuinely want to do. 
Philosophers back to Plato and Aristotle have a fancy term for this paradoxical failure of the will:
  <em>
    <a href=\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akrasia\\">
      akrasia
    </a>
  </em>
  . 
It encompasses procrastination, lack of self-control, lack of follow-through, and any kind of addictive behavior. 
Another way to define
  <em>
    akrasia
  </em>
  is by generalizing from procrastination to include
  <em>
    preproperation
  </em>
  as well. 
Procrastination is the irrational delay of tasks with immediate cost and delayed benefit. 
Preproperation is the irrational
  <em>
    not
  </em>
  delaying of (overindulgence in) activities with immediate benefit and delayed cost.
</p>
<p>
  Why do we have this problem? 
The technical answer is
  <a href=\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_inconsistency\\">
    time inconsistency
  </a>
  and is illustrated nicely in a
  <a
    href=\\"http://www.springerlink.com/content/06655508xl230511/\\"
    title=\\"Milkman, Rogers, and Bazerman\\"

    study on grocery-buying habits
  </a>
  : 
When buying groceries online for delivery tomorrow people buy a lot more ice cream and a lot fewer vegetables than when they&#8217;re ordering for delivery next week. 
In other words, our preferences are inconsistent &#8212; in fact, logically contradictory &#8212; over time. 
Your ability to weigh the costs and benefits (yumminess, healthiness) is severely compromised when some of those costs or benefits are immediate, which is why the ice cream vs vegetables decision plays out so differently when you decide it from a distance.
</p>
<p>
  How do we solve this problem? 
The answer is
  <em>
    self-binding
  </em>
  , that is, the use of
  <em>
    commitment devices
  </em>
  . 
The term
  <em>
    commitment device
  </em>
  is from game theory and applies to strategic situations. 
It refers to a way of changing one&#8217;s own incentives to make an otherwise empty threat or promise credible. 
This can be quite rational.
A classic example is from
  <a
    href=\\"http://books.google.com/books?id=7RkL4Z8Yg5AC\\"
    title=\\"Strategy of Conflict\\"
  >
    Thomas Schelling, who pioneered this aspect of game theory
  </a>
  . 
You&#8217;ve been kidnapped and you&#8217;d like to promise your kidnapper that if they let you go you won&#8217;t rat them out to the police. 
The promise is useless because the kidnapper knows you&#8217;ll have no incentive to keep it once you&#8217;re free (and so they won&#8217;t set you free). 
But if you can change your future incentives (implicate yourself in the crime, perhaps?) then suddenly your promise can carry weight.

  </a>
  Limiting your future options by voluntarily imposing consequences on your future self can be quite valuable in a strategic negotiation or conflict.
</p>
<p>
  But it&#8217;s hard to characterize as rational the use of self-binding with no one but
  <em>
    oneself
  </em>
  &#8230; until you appreciate that there&#8217;s in fact more than just
  <em>
    one
  </em>
  self.

<h2>
  Sapid Sweets and Seductive Sirens
</h2>
<p>
  Here&#8217;s a ubiquitous example. 
Why not save money by buying bulk-size candy? 
It&#8217;s technically entirely irrational not to. 
You should buy the bulk size, save the money, and then ration it to match the pace you&#8217;d eat it at when buying the individual sizes. 
Same consumption rate, less cost. 
The problem is your future self won&#8217;t
  <em>
    be
  </em>
  rational with a pile of candy in the house.
Sugar is a bit addictive, after all. 
So it&#8217;s worth spending some extra money to constrain the choices of your gluttonous future self. 
Similarly, some smokers buy cigarettes by the pack instead of the carton, paying a hefty premium to throttle their future consumption.
</p>
<p>
  The classic, prototypal example of self-binding is Odysseus tying himself to the mast of his ship so he could listen to the Sirens without getting lured onto the rocks. 
Calling Homer&#8217;s Sirens addictive is an understatement since they pretty much literally control your mind. 
But there are a lot of things in modern society (hello, Internet) that are at least a little addictive and getting more so.

  about how to beat akrasia but I believe that most of it misses a very fundamental point that renders it nearly useless: 
The myopic future self that thwarts your intentions is every bit as smart as your current, forward-looking self. 
You can make lists and set rewards and break tasks into small chunks, or plan diets and buy treadmills and establish routines, but mostly your future self will see right through all the tricks and just won&#8217;t give a damn. 
That version of yourself just wants to surf the web and/or eat pie. 
So that&#8217;s what you do, when the chips are down.
</p>
<p>
  The only way to be immune to future-you thumbing his or her nose at your current intentions is self-binding. 
Which is to say that successful anti-akrasia tricks will involve commitment devices. 
That&#8217;s because, by definition, a commitment device meaningfully constrains your recalcitrant future self&#8217;s actions. 
Here are a slew of commonly and not-so-commonly used commitment devices.

<h2>
  List of Real-World Commitment Devices
</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Buying the individual-sized instead of the bulk-sized candy
  </li>
  <li>
    Buying a gym membership even when it would be cheaper to buy individual passes, i.e., purposefully making it a sunk cost
  </li>
  <li>
    Getting a mortgage in part to force yourself to save [see the first reason listed at
    <a href=\\"http://messymatters.com/buyrent\\">
      messymatters.com/buyrent
    </a>
    for buying vs renting]
  </li>
  <li>
    Deleting games from your computer
  </li>
  <li>
    Going somewhere without internet access to get work done or using a purposefully handicapped computer
  </li>
  <li>
    Signing up for a class (or hiring a private instructor) when in theory you could just draw/run/paint/whatever regularly on your own (but without the commitment of the class you won&#8217;t)
  </li>
  <li>
    Using software that stops you from visiting time-wasting sites like facebook; e.g., LeechBlock or SelfControl
  </li>
  <li>
    Not having a TV in the house (even though it would be worth having for certain occasions)
  </li>
  <li>
    Identifying and eating as a strict vegetarian/vegan despite not actually minding whether you eat an occasional animal product
  </li>
  <li>
    Starting a project close to its hard deadline to limit the amount of time you can spend on it (though more often this is a manifestation of rather than a remedy for akrasia!)
  </li>
  <li>
    Not buying an unlimited metro card because once the subway fare is a sunk cost you won&#8217;t be as motivated to commute by bike
  </li>
  <li>
    Choosing to live somewhere that will force you to walk/bike further (in theory you could live closer and take a longer route, but you won&#8217;t)
  </li>
  <li>
    Having more than the minimum tax witheld from your salary, a zero-interest loan to the government, to force yourself to save enough to pay your taxes
  </li>
  <li>
    Using Certificates of Deposit with withdrawal penalties that outweigh the slightly higher interest rate they pay compared to a savings account
  </li>
  <li>
    Not taking a high-paying job for fear of getting hooked on the lifestyle it will lead to
  </li>
  <li>
    Using debit cards instead of credit cards, which force you not to spend more than you have
  </li>
  <li>
    Withdrawing less cash from the ATM to limit future spending
  </li>
  <li>
    Putting money in a Christmas Club (aka Santa Saver) account &#8212; a savings account that you cannot withdraw from until December

  What I find fascinating about that diverse list of commitment devices is the minuscule dent they put in the overall problem of akrasia. 
The tricks people actually use are mostly &#8212; with some interesting exceptions, such as #23 &#8212; band-aid solutions. 
The problem is not with the concept of precommitment. 
(Remember that akrasia is fundamentally a problem of your future self failing to follow through on your current intentions.) 
The problem is failing to commit hard enough. 
Take a goal like weighing twenty pounds less in a year. 
Band-aid commitment devices are things like keeping junk food out of the house and joining a gym. 
Why not get straight to the heart of the problem and make a contract with a friend that commits you to forfeiting a very painful sum of money if you don&#8217;t follow through on your weight-loss plan?
</p>
<p>
  Websites like StickK.com and Beeminder.com make it easy to do just that, also breaking down long-term goals like losing weight into weekly or even daily commitments to stay on track, using monetary commitment contracts to ensure compliance.
</p>
<h2>
  Bright Lines
</h2>
<p>
  Many people react viscerally to the idea of involving money. 
I&#8217;m partial to money myself but I don&#8217;t claim it&#8217;s the only way. 
Still, many obvious alternatives &#8212; like harnessing social disapproval &#8212; can fail if implemented naively. 
To make the long-term consequences of failing at your goal immediate, you need a bright and painful line. 
Using shame as a motivator with a public graph of your progress doesn&#8217;t quite cut it because there&#8217;s minimal shame in having one datapoint slightly off track &#8212; you&#8217;re still totally going to catch back up, right? 
As you then gradually drift away from your target the shame grows only gradually as well. 
You&#8217;re back in &#8220;one more day won&#8217;t matter&#8221; akrasia-addled fantasy land. (I speak from experience.)
</p>
<p>
  What sites like StickK and Beeminder offer, in addition to tangible and immediate consequences for going off track, is setting a bright line so you know exactly what going off track means.
</p>
<p>
  To return to the specific case of healthcare, I would like to conclude with an example of a patient committing on Beeminder to gradually lower their fasting blood sugar (used with permission):

    Although I&#8217;m using the multiple selves terminology, I view it as no more than a rhetorical device. There are not multiple selves in any real sense.
Rather, as I will argue, there&#8217;s in fact just one true you whose decision-making is sometimes distorted in the presence of immediate consequences, which act like a drug.
Which is to say (as an empirical fact) that when a decision involves some consequences that are immediate and some that are distant, humans irrationally (no amount of future discounting can account for it) over-weight the immediate consequences.
So I refer to multiple selves but I believe there is one true self: the one not under the influence of immediate consequences.

      Christmas Club accounts [were] a staple of American banking in the 1970s. The Christmas Club account was, on the surface, a bizarre idea: You gave the bank money every month.
The bank paid you no interest, and it would not let you take the money out until Dec 1. 
This was not much of a bargain. And yet Americans happily put their money into Christmas Club accounts, even though that same money in a savings account would have earned them interest.

    No-drop prosecution is an option to press charges against an abusive spouse and stipulate that you don&#8217;t want to be allowed to drop them (the charges). 
Actually I believe you don&#8217;t literally have the choice to stipulate that &#8212; you&#8217;re either in a no-drop jurisdiction or you&#8217;re not &#8212; but some economists have inferred that many domestic violence victims would choose no-drop prosecution if they could. 
In the case of an abusive relationship I could imagine strategic reasons for that (so you can&#8217;t, and your spouse knows you can&#8217;t, cave to threats to get you to drop charges) but the claim is that due to the sad psychology of domestic violence victims, it&#8217;s really about forcing your future self to follow through with what you know (when you sit back and reflect) is the right thing to do.

    The setup is that he let his students pick their project deadlines for the whole semester. Once they&#8217;re picked they fail the course (they paid thousands for this course, we presume) if they don&#8217;t meet them. So rationally they should choose all the deadlines to be on the last day, to maximize flexibility. But it was clear to students that that was a terrible idea. And sure enough, the ones who precommitted to spaced-out deadlines did better.

    In another study, students were given coupons &#8212; some of which had expiration dates &#8212; for free ice cream. The students expressed greater value for non-expiring coupons but got more value from the coupons

  Here&#8217;s a thing users really hated about Beeminder until today:
when Beeminder told them they needed to 
floss their teeth 0.23 times or 
archive 6.8 emails or 
whatever nonsensical / physically impossible thing.
I personally shrugged that off for years.
Obviously you just mentally take the ceiling of that number, right?
If you have to floss 0.23 times and your possible choices are flossing zero times and one time, then the requirement to floss 0.23 times is logically equivalent to a requirement to floss exactly once.

  No. Bad. Illusion of transparency!

  .
We think we implemented this really nicely so that you&#8217;ll only see decimal places when it actually makes sense to, namely, when you have at least some datapoints that are not integers.
But it&#8217;s possible that you really liked seeing those decimals even on your patently integery goals.
(&#8220;Integery&#8221; is what we call goals where only whole numbers make sense.)
If so, we just made Beeminder slightly worse for you.
But only slightly!
We now have a per-goal &#8220;precision&#8221; setting so you just have to go set that to however many decimal places you like.
</p>
<p>
  Most of you, however, do not in fact like decimals and for you, all the numbers should be much saner as of today.
If you did once enter a 1/2 for a datapoint value but still only want to see integers, you too can force that by setting your goal&#8217;s &#8220;precision&#8221; field to 1.
</p>
<p>
  Everyone&#8217;s happy!
</p>
<h2>
  Do I need to read the rest of this?
</h2>
<p>
  You absolutely do not!
In fact, it&#8217;s way more nitty-gritty than you can reasonably care about.
But since some of you unreasonably care about such things, you can read on for the rest of the story&#8230;
</p>
<p>
  Wait though, before you go, here&#8217;s a handy list of the main user-visible improvements:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    More consistent/correct conservative rounding so you&#8217;re never misled about how much you have to do.
  </li>
  <li>
    Goals default to integery until you enter a datapoint that&#8217;s not a whole number.
  </li>
  <li>
    We generalized the &#8220;integery&#8221; field to &#8220;precision&#8221;. Instead of integery (only available for custom goals) you can now set precision=1 on any goal.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can customize how many decimal places you see by setting precision &lt; 1.
  </li>
  <li>
    You no longer see a superfluous &#8220;.0&#8221; appended to every dang datapoint value.
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>
  Timey-Wimey Goals
</h3>
<p>
  There&#8217;s one case where we show fractional amounts without decimal points: 
goals whose datapoints and bare-min or hard-cap values are shown in HH:MM format.
That&#8217;s a separate checkbox in settings:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    [ ] Show data in HH:MM format
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  If checked then every datapoint value, bare min, hard cap, safety buffer, etc &#8212; including the &#8220;precision&#8221; field

<h3>
  Integery Goals
</h3>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;Users were genuinely baffled or walked away in disgust&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  Dealing with integery goals correctly is a special case of conservative rounding.
If you have a hard cap of turning your phone&#8217;s screen on 4.92 more times, then Beeminder better let you know you can do it up to 4 more times, not 5.
In general, we want to round up in the case of an integery do-more goal, or down in the case of do-less.
Even more generally, we want to round in the direction of the good side of the yellow brick road.
</p>
<p>
  And it&#8217;s all the same principle no matter what we&#8217;re rounding to, so behind the scenes we implemented this nice and generally.
</p>
<p>
  In particular, in addition to the &#8220;timey&#8221; field, every Beeminder goal now has two new fields:
&#8220;precision&#8221; and an internal field keeping track of whether the precision was set explicitly by the user.
</p>
<h3>
  The &#8220;Precision&#8221; Field
</h3>
<p>
  You can think of the precision as the granularity of the thing being measured, though Beeminder will always count any value you give it towards your goal.
All numbers displayed for what you need to do for the goal are rounded conservatively to the nearest quantum as defined by this field.
(Note: we never round the datapoint values themselves &#8212; those always keep whatever precision they were born with.)
If precision is 1 then the goal is integery.
For dollar amounts you might want a precision of 0.01.
Or 0.1 for a weight goal if your scale weighs to the nearest tenth of a kilogram.
</p>
<p>
  (Terminological warning: If we think of the amount to round to as the precision then it&#8217;s confusing to talk about greater precision when we mean a smaller value for the field.
Instead, we always refer to finer or coarser precision.)
</p>
<p>
  The &#8220;precision&#8221; field is found in goal settings, defaults to 1, and has explanatory/help text as follows:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Display Precision: _______
    <br>
    Determines how many decimal places to display. E.g., your weight has precision 0.1 if that&#8217;s what your scale measures to. Use &#8220;1&#8221; if you never want to see decimals.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  In theory you could have a precision coarser than 1.
We don&#8217;t know of a use case where that would be better than precision 1 so we haven&#8217;t worried our pretty heads about that so far.
(Let us know if you have a use case!)
</p>
<p>
  A precision of zero means no rounding at all &#8212; full machine precision.
No one wants that and the UI enforces a precision of 0.00001 or coarser.
</p>
<p>
  Again, if timey is true then &#8220;precision&#8221; in the above UI is also shown in HH:MM format.

  , the overwhelming majority of goals are integery or timey-wimey.
The first obvious decision was to make integery goals 
(precision = 1)
the default, 
or precision = 1/60 for timey-wimey goals.
That alone is what should make newbees never have to think about any of this!
</p>
<h3>
  Whether The User Explicitly Set a Precision
</h3>
<p>
  We also store a flag indicating if the precision field was set explicitly by the user.
It&#8217;s initially false.
The first time the user submits a value for precision in goal settings, the flag is set permanently to true.
</p>
<p>
  Every time a datapoint is added, if the flag is false, we set precision to the min of itself and however much precision the datapoint value actually has.
(But also not finer than 0.00001.)
For example, from a datapoint value of 1.23 we infer a precision of 0.01 (2 decimal places).
We worked out all the code for this &#8212; which we call conservarounding &#8212; at

  Fractional beeminding works fine. 
That&#8217;s when you have an inherently integery metric but you treat it as non-integery and enter fractional amounts. 
It&#8217;s a thing, it&#8217;s fine, none of this impacts it.

  If someone enters a fraction like 1/3 as a datapoint value, that gets macro-expanded in the UI to &#8220;0.333333333333333333&#8221;.
Similarly, datapoints submitted via the API could accidentally have a stupid amount of precision.
Decision: Tough cookies, go fix the precision if it&#8217;s messed up.
(But let us know if it&#8217;s too ugly because we may adjust the limit on how fine the precision can be.)

  What happens to the precision when you rescale your data and the graph?
If the flag that says the user explicitly set precision is true then we just rescale the precision as well.
Otherwise, set precision = 1 and then rescale all the datapoints, triggering an update for each of them.
That sets precision however makes sense according to the precision-inferring function based on the new data.
What about if rescaling yields stupidly fine precision?
This we callously ignore.
If you&#8217;re rescaling then you can set your own dang precision.

  What if you have a totally integery do-less goal with a rate of 2/7 so the PPRs are .571429 or whatever?
Do they just ruin the integeriness of your goal until you go set an explicit precision = 1?
(Deleting the PPR doesn&#8217;t help since inferred precision isn&#8217;t recomputed when datapoints are deleted.)
Answer: No, because we don&#8217;t update precision based on PPRs.
Those aren&#8217;t user-originating datapoints.

<p>
  Let&#8217;s dive in with some terminology. 
In the Yellow Brick Half-Plane New World Order, yellow brick roads have no thickness. 
We call them razor roads.
</p>
<p>
  The Days-To-Derail (DTD) function takes a yellow brick road and a (time, value) datapoint and gives the amount of safety buffer AKA the number of safe days. 
Every point on the good side of the road maps to an integer number of days greater than or equal to 1. 
(Shortly we&#8217;ll generalize that to the reals but bear with us.)
Every point exactly on the razor road maps to 1. 
You will derail tomorrow if you&#8217;re exactly on the road today (and don&#8217;t report new data). 
Any point on the wrong side of the road maps to 0. 
You will derail today at your deadline if you are still on the wrong side of the road.
</p>
<p>
  Level curves (AKA isolines) refer to curves along which a function has the same value. 
The boundaries between color-coded regions on the graph indicating how much safety buffer you have are coincident with level curves of the DTD function.
The level curve for DTD=0 is the razor road itself &#8212; the boundary between 0 and 1 days of safety buffer.
</p>
<p>
  Pessimistic Presumptive Reports (PPRs) normally refer to a

    title=\\"Very old Beeminder blog post introducing Pessimistic Presumptive Reports\\"
  >
    specific Beeminder feature for do-less goals
  </a>
  but here we&#8217;re generalizing the concept. 
Conceptually, a do-more goal has PPRs of zero because if you don&#8217;t report data on a do-more goal then your graph flatlines. 
So here when talking about PPRs we mean them in the general sense that applies to all Beeminder graphs.
</p>
<p>
  Yellow Brick Roads are defined as piecewise-linear functions and we need a name for the points where the slope changes. 
The mathematical term &#8220;inflection point&#8221; is commonly abused to mean any sudden change in slope of a graph. 
The actual mathematical term we want is &#8220;second-order discontinuity&#8221; or &#8220;critical point&#8221;. 
As is also common in math, we&#8217;re using the word &#8220;kink&#8221; since its primary definition &#8212; &#8220;a sharp twist or curve in something that is otherwise straight&#8221; &#8212; captures intuitively what we mean. 
(Yes, we feel slightly weird about it.)
If the kink is a transition from positive to negative slope we call it a peak and for negative to positive, a valley. 
Most kinks are just sudden changes in slope, neither a peak nor valley.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, we refer to do-more and do-less goals here but everything we say about do-more goals generalizes straightforwardly to weight-loss goals where the sign of everything is reversed. 
And everything we say about do-less goals generalizes to rationing goals where the road goes down and you need to stay above it. 
More technically, when referring to do-more goals we really mean goals with
  <code>
    yaw*dir &gt; 0
  </code>
  (Platonic types MOAR and PHAT) and everything we say about do-less goals generalizes to
  <code>
    yaw*dir &lt; 0
  </code>
  (Platonic types WEEN and RASH).

<h2>
  The Mathy Meat
</h2>
<p>
  In principle, you can compute days to derailment by simply stepping forward day-by-day along the PPR direction until you reach the road. 
This works fine for figuring out the current safety buffer for the user&#8217;s current datapoint. 
But in the Yellow Brick Half-Plane New World Order we&#8217;ve replaced the concept of lanes of the road with color-coded regions for how much safety buffer you have. 
(Again, DTD=0 is red, DTD=1 is orange, DTD=2 is blue, DTD&ge;3 is green, and DTD&ge;7 is&#8230; we&#8217;re not sure yet but in the examples below we&#8217;ve gone with dark green.) 
So we need a much more efficient, elegant, and continuous algorithm. 
You can&#8217;t do the step-forward algorithm again and again for every point in the (half-)plane!
</p>
<p>
  The idea for this algorithm comes from the observation that just like we can move forward along the PPR direction from any given point on the graph, we can also move backwards along the PPR for points on the road. 
Doing this would yield a mechanism for pre-computing the DTD value for every point on the graph. 
That&#8217;s not practical but at least lets us visualize the DTD field. 
In particular, we define the DTD function as follows:
</p>
<p>
  DTD: R
  <sup>
    2
  </sup>
  &rarr; R+
</p>
<p>
  such that for any [t,v] in R
  <sup>
    2
  </sup>
  , DTD([t,v]) yields days to derail as a positive real number.
</p>
<p>
  The following image illustrates how this backward propagation is done for a do-less goal where the daily PPR rate is twice the road slope. 
The black line is the razor road, red lines are along the PPR vector, and crosses indicate increasing integer steps for the PPR.
</p>
<p>
  <img
    src=\\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1292086/70180858-df72e600-16f1-11ea-8876-585b547e3e6c.png\\"
    alt=\\"image\\"
  >
</p>
<p>
  Here is a more complex do-less road with both negative slopes (for which PPR=0), and flat segments (for which PPR=2 per current Beeminder convention).
</p>
<p>
  <img
    src=\\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1292086/70184511-0385f580-16f9-11ea-9fcb-fa53f7ea0c7a.png\\"
    alt=\\"image\\"
  >
</p>
<p>
  An important observation in these graphs is that the line below each kink in the road is divided into segments, each of which result in derailment by hitting one of the road segments that come afterwards. 
The first region derails in the road segment that immediately follows. 
The second region derails two segments ahead, the third three segments ahead, and so forth. 
This is illustrated with the blue ellipses and arrows in the above graph.
</p>
<p>
  This suggests an efficient representation for these back-propagated PPR lines as simple piecewise uniform regions below every kink in the road. 
We call this the DTD array, which stores, for every kink in the road, a sequence of vertical coordinates and associated DTD values corresponding to the boundaries of these uniform regions. 
For the second example above, the DTD array looks like this:
</p>
<pre>
  <code>
    [ 
  [x=30, [y=10, dtd=0],  [y=8,  dtd=1]] 
  [x=20, [y=5,  dtd=0],  [y=0,  dtd=10], [y=-2, dtd=11]] 
  [x=15, [y=7,  dtd=0],  [y=5,  dtd=5],  [y=0,  dtd=15], [y=-2,  dtd=16] ] 
  [x=7,  [y=1,  dtd=0],  [y=-5, dtd=8],  [y=-7, dtd=13], [y=-12, dtd=23], [y=-14, dtd=24] ] 
  [x=0,  [y=0,  dtd=0],  [y=-1, dtd=7],  [y=-7, dtd=15], [y=-9,  dtd=20], [y=-14, dtd=30], [y=-16, dtd=31] ] 
]
  </code>
</pre>
<p>
  The array starts from the last kink in the road since that makes it easier to generate the array.
Also note that since the last road segment is considered to extend indefinitely into the future, only one day ahead of the kink is recorded.
The remaining days can be inferred linearly from the slope.
</p>
<p>
  A similar construction works for do-more goals, where PPR is always zero, with the PPR extensions going back in time towards the left as shown here:
</p>
<p>
  <img
    src=\\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1292086/70235427-f9550d00-1773-11ea-9d45-850d0d02ccaf.png\\"
    alt=\\"image\\"
  >
</p>
<p>
  It&#8217;s interesting that do-less goals always end up with all backward PPR extensions remaining on the good side of the road, with no intersections between them since the PPR slope is always below the road slope by construction. 
This is, however, not true for do-more goals. 
For example:
</p>
<p>
  <img
    src=\\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1292086/70235646-61a3ee80-1774-11ea-9fc5-ae08c08c9eed.png\\"
    alt=\\"image\\"
  >
</p>
<p>
  The PPR extensions for parts of the road with negative slope both traverse the wrong side of the road and overlap earlier regions of the PPR extensions. 
This poses substantial problems for efficiently constructing the level curves for the DTD function.
</p>
<p>
  For do-less goals, simply connecting points along these lines with the same DTD value yields level curves for the DTD function:
</p>
<p>
  <img
    src=\\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1292086/70266507-a9933780-17ad-11ea-9701-11f3388cc488.png\\"
    alt=\\"image\\"
  >
</p>
<p>
  We still need a computationally efficient way to construct these level curves though.
Fortunately this is possible by seeing that these level curves are piecewise linear, and their kinks occur either at the same horizontal coordinate as the kinks in the road, or sideways connections between successive DTD array components. 
In the figure above, the black circles indicate components of the DTD array along each road kink. 
Notice that the kinks of the piecewise linear curves occur either along the vertical lines aligned with the road kinks, or along the lines connecting the ith DTD array to the corresponding segment of the i+1st DTD array. 
Starting from the rightmost road segment, this lets us go iteratively leftwards, back in time, to construct the level curve associated with a particular choice of DTD =some constant. 
An example of this construction is illustrated by the green circles in the figure above for DTD=3, following the ranges within the DTD array containing DTD=3.
</p>
<p>
  Applying the same algorithm to do-more goals works similarly, but only when there are no segments with negative slope:
</p>
<p>
  <img
    src=\\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1292086/70269181-eada1600-17b2-11ea-956b-577cc0466eef.png\\"
    alt=\\"image\\"
  >
</p>
<p>
  (Why would a do-more goal have negative slope? 
Hush, we&#8217;re doing math here.
Also, it totally does happen and we&#8217;re pretty sure if we didn&#8217;t get this right in its full generality it would bite us hard.)
</p>
<p>
  The resulting level curves are much simpler than do-less goals, being simply left-shifted versions of the road itself. 
That&#8217;s because the back-propagated DTD lines are all parallel and extend leftwards. 
Unfortunately, this does not yield correct results for do-more goals with negative slopes:

<h2>
  The Home Stretch, with Garish Graphs
</h2>
<p>
  Even if we hide the parts of these level curves that fall below the road, the peaks mess up the colored regions:
</p>
<p>

</p>
<div style=\\"border-style:solid;border-width:1px;padding:10px 70px 20px\\">
  <p>
    <strong>
      Aside!
    </strong>
    Don&#8217;t panic about how weird these graphs look!
At least for the initial launch of Yellow Brick Half-Plane we&#8217;re mimicking the existing yellow brick roads as closely as possible by just drawing thin lines at the boundaries of these colored regions.
Shading the whole regions makes a ton of sense conceptually and we may do that later, especially if we can find a way to make it look less garish than these examples!
  </p>
</div>
<p>
  Colored regions to the left of the peaks in the road should not also have peaks but should be smoothed out like so:
</p>
<p>
  <img
    src=\\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1292086/70346118-9d22e380-186e-11ea-8c09-7b13802df679.png\\"
    alt=\\"image\\"
  >
</p>
<p>
  We solve this by filtering the level curves after running the above algorithm for do-more goals. 
Namely, for each peak in the road, we enforce a flat section on the level curves before and after the peak, terminating after DTD days (whatever the DTD value is for the level curve we&#8217;re computing) or at the next valley, whichever comes first.
After that, it falls back to the unfiltered level curve and continues. 
We think of it as a monotonicity filter even though the level curves can have negative slope after peaks, as seen above.
</p>
<p>
  We have to be especially careful when these flat regions overlap, handling various edge cases. 
The following figure illustrates some of these special cases, particularly for the light green region which corresponds to DTD=6:

  Phew! 
That was way more than you wanted to know but, well, correction, that was way more than almost everyone wanted to know and so they didn&#8217;t read it. 
But
  <em>
    you
  </em>
  did so you must&#8217;ve wanted to know and we sure are touched! 
But in case you skimmed over all this and are just now rejoining us, let us reemphasize that the graphs won&#8217;t actually look like above when we ship this.
This is the theory behind it.
And it&#8217;s going to be amazing!
Well, from our perspective it will be amazing.
From your perspective, as a normal user, it will almost seem like nothing happened.
Rest assured that a ridiculous amount of work is going in to make it seem that way!
In fact, this whole post is just one small piece of it.

<p>
  By 2 PM yesterday, I was jumping out of my skin. 
I haven’t been further than the balcony in twelve days and I’m going just a little stir-crazy. 
Waiting for the end of anything, especially something of an undetermined length, can feel pretty long. 
Heck, I find even the feeling of anticipating something enjoyable a little aversive. 
A master of patience, I am not. 
As our city and province strengthen their not-quite-a-lockdown-yet guidelines, I’m starting to think about ways to keep myself feeling healthy, happy, and patient while we&#8217;re all doing our parts to practice maximal social distancing and flatten that curve. 
 
 
Here’s what I plan on doing and why, in case it’s helpful to others.
</p>
<p>
  I like to distract myself from thinking about an upcoming event that I’m looking forward to with something I’d prefer to have more time for. 
I find this helps tip the scales a little and make the wait not feel so long.
One of my favourite ways of doing that is to take on a challenge, to pick something I&#8217;ll try to accomplish or complete before the arrival of the date or hour I’m looking forward to. 
That way, I’m almost rooting for having more time so that I can meet that challenge and satisfy my completionism, and that’s one way I plan to weather waiting things out now.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;I’m almost rooting for having more time&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  If we need to stay home longer than it takes me to complete whatever I set out to do, I’ll have achieved something that I wanted to achieve, which’d be a boost, and I can pick another to ride out the remaining time. 
If things go better than we expect and I don’t win the race to the finish, I’ll be excited about the state of the world. 
Either way, I win.
</p>
<p>
  I like to pick something I’d be doing by choice. 
Picking something I already have to get done in that time won’t really add anything extra, so I avoid aiming at those things.
</p>
<p>
  If you want to try something similar, here are some ideas of the kinds of challenges you could take on:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      A project that’s been on your to-do list for ages and that isn’t urgent, but that you’d feel great having off your back. 
(For example, getting through any digital or paperwork backlogs.)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Something that has a deadline that falls outside of the range of time you think social distancing measures will need to be in place and that you want to try to complete more quickly. 
(Finishing the first draft of your thesis or dissertation, maybe.)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      A stretch goal that you’d never need to do, but that it would be fun or exciting to have done. 
(Finishing something you’ve been writing for fun, for instance, or trying to walk the distance to your dream vacation spot, which also keeps you moving.)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Learning something you haven’t had time for. 
(You could watch a self-selected curriculum of online courses or even take a self-paced massive open online course from a top university, or you could get through the next level of a language-learning course.)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Something purely for fun. 
(Like finishing the full storyline of an especially long video game, watching all of the Star Wars movies, or reading that trilogy gathering dust on your bookshelf.)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      A competition with a friend. 
(Which of you will take more steps, get to inbox zero first, learn more new recipes, read the most books&#8230;?)
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  I want my own first challenges to include something that’s on my to-do list, but never makes its way to the top. 
I’m going to try to eliminate the non-urgent paperwork backlog that’s been back-burnered by more important things and that just keeps growing, like a colony of tribbles.

</a>
<p>
  I also want something that’ll be a bit of silly fun while being more active, so I’m going to try to play through all of Ring Fit Adventure on the Switch.

  >
</a>
<p>
  Finally, the biggie: 
I’m going to try to finish the first draft of my dissertation. 
I’m going to restart it from zero, rewriting the parts that are already written and drafting the remaining pieces that are still just collections of notes. 
I&#8217;m also going to give myself a hefty reward if I beat the clock on this one!

  I&#8217;m hoping these challenges will help keep the time from passing too slowly, and I hope something in here is useful to you too.

<p>
  Everything’s a bit of a mess right now. 
Okay, you can say that any time, but this time I think people all over the place are going to agree. 
The problem for me is that it’s hard to segment that off from my normal everyday life, which I still have to live: 
dishes have to get into and out of the dishwasher, 
I still need to drink more water, and 
all your emails still need answering. 
It’s already quite hard for me to block out worries (hooboy, that anxiety disorder) and now&#8230; well.
</p>
<p>
  So I need a safety bubble, to help me keep things in context and face the situation with some degree of dignity. 
So how am I doing it? 
Using Beeminder, of course! 
There are basically four categories to my response:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    How are my existing goals feeling? 
Do they need dialling up or down to help me respond to the situation?
  </li>
  <li>
    What do I need to do less of now that I never thought of beeminding before?
  </li>
  <li>
    What do I need to boost my feelings of happiness and fulfillment?
  </li>
  <li>
    Is there anything else I need to beemind to boost my physical health?
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Let’s break it down further, and add in some tasty examples&#8230;
</p>
<h3>
  How are my existing goals feeling?
</h3>
<p>
  The UK government has, at the time of writing, issued instructions that we should only leave our homes for one form of exercise per day. 
My usual form of exercise is walking supplemented by some bodyweight workouts, so I had a step goal&#8230; dialled as if I’d be going out for walks three times a day. 
Alas, my step goal, we hardly knew ye &#8212; archive! 
I just can’t guarantee the lockdown isn’t going to mess this up entirely.
</p>
<p>
  Then I have
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/shanaqui/reassurance\\"
    title=\\"This goal has definitely had its ups and downs\\"
  >
    a long-standing goal called reassurance
  </a>
  that has always been aimed at helping with my anxiety. 
For some people with anxiety, there’s a cycle: 
ask for reassurance about a thing, 
receive reassurance about the thing, 
require more reassurance about the thing. 
For me, that circle tends to get tighter and tighter, with the reassurance required more and more often
  <em>
    and
  </em>
  more promptly.
</p>
<a href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/shanaqui/reassurance\\">
  <img
    class=\\"aligncenter\\"
    width=\\"225px\\"
    alt=\\"Shanaqui's reassurance goal on Beeminder\\"
    title=\\"Shanaqui's reassurance goal on Beeminder\\"
    src=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/shanaqui/reassurance.png\\"
  >
</a>
<p>
  So how do I want to dial this goal for this situation? 
Maybe I want a little more leeway; maybe it’s okay to seek reassurance right now to help balance out everything else. 
Maybe I want to be stricter than ever: no spirals here! 
It’s worth a good long think about goals that cut both ways like this one. 
I’ve opted to leave it the same and see how things go. 
That’s the beauty of Beeminder: 
you’re not locked into a goal for any longer than seven days. 
I definitely advise people to make room for reviewing their goals to suit their needs on a regular basis.
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/shanaqui/weeklyreview\\"
    title=\\"I totally beemind it\\"
  >
    You could even beemind it&#8230;
  </a>
</p>
<h3>
  What do I need to do less of now, that I never thought of beeminding before?
</h3>
<p>
  It doesn’t matter whether you format this as a do-less goal (for which you need premium) or a do-more goal that requires +1 every day to say you’re keeping up with it: 
the point is, for a lot of people we’re now engaging in really unhealthy behaviours. 
Maybe people newly working from home are learning that if they stay in their jammies all day, they feel ick. 
(I’ve been
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/shanaqui/upanddressed\\"
    title=\\"My wife says Beeminder is my operating system\\"
  >
    beeminding that
  </a>
  since September 2018.)
</p>
<p>
  For me, the no-brainer here is my habit of checking the news. 
It’s another of those anxious cycles. 
Wait! A wild Beeminder goal appears, and now I can only check the news twice per day.

</a>
<h3>
  What do I need to do to boost my feelings of happiness and fulfilment?
</h3>
<p>
  When times are tough, it’s good to have something to look forward to, and it’s also good to keep your mind working on other things. 
I’ve gone with boosting both with my new goals. 
On the end of pure fun, I have my readalong of
  <em>
    The Priory of the Orange Tree
  </em>
  by Samantha Shannon, 
alongside the other workerbees. 
Heck yeah, we’re all beeminding that! 
I also have a goal to attend rehearsal for the
  <a

    title=\\"It&#39;s like choir, only socially distant!\\"
  >
    Great British Home Chorus

  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"

    href=\\"#GBHC\\"
  >
    [1]
  </a>
  every single day (except weekends, when there&#8217;s no rehearsal). 
It doesn’t matter if I have to play it back later, but I’ve got to keep up!
</p>

</a>
<p>
  But it’s not just about things that directly make you happy. 
It’s good to have goals which make you feel like you’re making the best of your time &#8212; and for me, the best goals for that are always about learning something. 
And even though this is Operation Safety Bubble, that doesn’t mean never thinking about what’s going on: 
I’ve picked up courses on FutureLearn and Coursera all about our very best friend, COVID-19, because understanding it will help me better evaluate the news.

<p>
  If you have some long-term career goals, maybe now’s the time to work on those! 
I’m not beeminding it yet, but I have an application for an MSc I should be working on&#8230; I just need to figure out the best way to shoehorn this into a goal.
</p>
<h3>
  What do I need to beemind to boost my physical health?
</h3>
<p>
  There are some unique challenges right now, like the restrictions on exercising out-of-doors I mentioned earlier. 
What’s more, I live in an upstairs flat with a crotchety downstairs neighbour who would not thank me if I ordered a treadmill, though goodness knows I’m tempted. 
I miss stretching my legs!
</p>
<p>
  So I need some new goals. 
This one isn’t
  <em>
    brand
  </em>
  new, but it’s a recent one: 
I’ve got to do six bodyweight workouts per week.
</p>
<a href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/shanaqui/bodyweight\\">

    src=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/shanaqui/bodyweight.png\\"
  >
</a>
<p>
  I’m thinking about adding in a goal for following
  <a
    href=\\"https://yogawithadriene.com/calendar/\\"
    title=\\"Time to get all bendy!\\"
  >
    one of
    <em>

    ’s calendars
  </a>
  . 
Some of those themes look apropos &#8212; anyone else

  >
    feeling the need for a reset
  </a>
  ?
</p>
<p>
  The point is, you need to remember to make space in your current routine for your physical health as well as your mental health. 
It’s not about coming out of quarantine looking ripped (unless you want it to be), so maybe your goals for health would be more about remembering to turn your screens off a couple of hours before bed, or remembering to drink enough water.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
  So that’s it; those are my four steps for re-evaluating my Beeminder goals to support me &#8212; and push me! &#8212; during Britain’s lockdown. 
Don’t forget that this is an ongoing process: 
what’s working for you now might not work in a month’s time. 
It’s always going to be worth trying out a goal and seeing how it feels.

Well, one particular dream, which will have come true in another year or so of hard work.]
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  When I was 9 years old I went to a beach party.
As the sun set and the bonfire was lit a guy broke out his guitar and started playing familiar songs.
People gathered close to the fire, but closer to him, and broke into song as the music moved them.
At that moment I realized that I wanted to learn how to play guitar.
</p>
<p>
  It&#8217;s now 22 years later and I am finally on track to achieve that dream.
Over the last 3 months I have practiced 50 hours on my steel string acoustic guitar.
This has been the most challenging goal I have ever set for myself and I have had to draw on all my experience, knowledge, and discipline to make progress.
But that wasn&#8217;t enough and it wasn&#8217;t until I discovered Beeminder that my progress really accelerated.
</p>
<h2>
  You Don&#8217;t Need More Stuff
</h2>
<p>
  I received the guitar as a gift from my wife on my 31st birthday.
It is one of the best gifts she has ever given me because it signaled to me that she supported my growth and it inspired me to start learning.
Along with the guitar she also gave me a case, tuner, picks, and instructional DVD.
</p>
<p>
  Of course, I started practicing immediately and I watched the DVD and I tried to play chords and make some music.
I realized very quickly how hard it was to create chords.
I couldn&#8217;t even figure out how I was supposed to hold the guitar in my lap.
It felt so foreign.
</p>
<p>
  I thought that the problem was that I needed a guitar strap, so I hopped online and spent an hour researching and subsequently buying a strap.
Then I went on to buy 4 music books, a music stand, a metronome, a capo and another box of picks.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;This is a trick the brain pulls to protect you from failing at something new or challenging.&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  I actually thought that I needed more stuff and I researched buying an electric guitar, an amp, more picks, different strings, additional books, lessons, a better acoustic.
My steel string acoustic was so hard to play that I actually thought that maybe it was the guitar&#8217;s fault&#8230;
I thought I had already learned this lesson but I fell right into the trap.
This is a trick the brain pulls to protect you from failing at something new or challenging.
It provides excuses that allow you to justify why you aren&#8217;t doing something.

<h2>
  You Do Need a SMART Goal
</h2>
<p>
  I know goal setting is kind of dorky and apparently the new hip thing is to not set goals while in fact you are setting goals.
If you read
  <a href=\\"http://zenhabits.net/best-year/\\">
    Zen Habits
  </a>
  then you know what I am talking about.
</p>
<p>
  I have had some experience with SMART (Specific, Measurable, Action-Oriented, Realistic, Time-based) goals and I have found them surprisingly powerful.

  .]
I had not taken the time to really outline what I was trying to accomplish every time I picked up the guitar.
</p>
<p>
  How long does it take to get good enough to play around the campfire and entertain your friends?
I turned to Google and found 2 years of consistent practice was often tossed out as a normal amount of time to go from Beginner to
  <a href=\\"http://j2jenkins.com/2012/01/04/who-wants-to-be-a-master-i-want-to-be-good-enough/\\">
    Good Enough
  </a>
  .
</p>
<p>
  So: practice 30 minutes every day for two years and I should be good enough to play guitar and impress my friends.
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    People often use the excuse, &#8220;there is no way I will ever be an expert&#8221; for why they aren&#8217;t working toward their goal.
The truth is that you don&#8217;t need to be an expert, you just need to be Good Enough.
  </em>
</p>
<h2>
  You Don&#8217;t Need More Time
</h2>
<p>
  Now, I already knew that if I was going to learn I would need to find a window of time to practice on a regular basis.
This is one of the most challenging and overlooked parts of changing any habit.
We are all busy.
</p>
<p>
  I thought about practicing in the morning before my wife and baby were awake, but I quickly realized that the guitar is way too loud and that I would wake them up.
Besides, I wasn&#8217;t really in the mood to play in the morning.
I thought about adding it after everyone went to bed, but the issue of noise came up again.
</p>
<p>
  I realized that I was going to have to squeeze it in during the prime hours of After Work and Before Bedtime.
Since I cook dinner and do dishes while my wife watches the baby and does bathtime I realized that this was when I was going to have to carve out some time for myself.
</p>
<p>
  I tried to figure out ways to be more efficient while I was cooking dinner.
I started washing dishes as I cooked and I focused on keeping the work space clean to reduce the amount of cleanup afterwards.
All of a sudden I was wrapping up the kitchen just as they were heading off to bath.
</p>
<p>
  Now I had a solid 30 minutes of time to practice guitar.
Since I had worked so hard in the kitchen to create this time I was a little extra motivated to hop right into practicing.
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    People often use the excuse, &#8220;there is not enough time&#8221; for why they aren&#8217;t learning a new skill.
The truth is that you have to create time for the things you want to do.
  </em>
</p>
<h2>
  You Do Have To Keep Trying
</h2>
<p>
  I started practicing and I started to make some headway.
It was intermittent though.
</p>
<p>
  I practiced every day for a week, and then it was every other day, then I let a couple days go by, and then a couple weeks, and then a couple months went by.
Even though I had bought all the stuff, clearly defined the goal, and carved out time in my busy day I failed at making guitar practice a daily habit.
</p>
<p>
  I know I am not alone in this area.
Garages and storage sheds all across the country are filled with the debris of failed goals like mine.
I could have packed all my guitar stuff up and buried it in a closet so that it would stop quietly mocking me but I knew that I wasn&#8217;t done with the guitar.
I just needed to tweak my formula a little bit.
</p>
<p>
  I thought deeply about why this was happening.
I really wanted to learn how to play the guitar.
It had been a life-long dream of my mine and yet I couldn&#8217;t consistently sit down and practice guitar.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;I had all kinds of reasons why tonight was not the best night to practice and why tomorrow would be better.&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  What I was doing was letting myself off the hook each night.
I was too tired, I had chores to do, I didn&#8217;t want to annoy my wife, etc.
I had all kinds of reasons why tonight was not the best night to practice and why tomorrow would be better.
Besides, tomorrow I could do a double session and catch up, right?
Never mind the fact that I could barely squeeze in one practice session a night.
How was I going to fit in two?
</p>
<p>
  My system went out the window as my present self failed to hold up his part of the bargain.
Sit down and practice 30 minutes a day.
Present self didn&#8217;t have to be a good guitar player.
That responsibility falls on future self.
Present self just had to show up every night to play.
And yet he consistently failed.
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    People often use the excuse, &#8220;I tried that once and failed&#8221; as a reason to stop trying.
The truth is that you learn something about yourself every time you fail.
  </em>
</p>
<h2>
  You Do Need To Make A Commitment
</h2>
<p>
  Luckily for me I discovered Beeminder.
</p>
<p>
  I took the data I had so far and uploaded it into a Beeminder graph.
One thing I love and hate about graphs is that they don&#8217;t lie or pull punches.
Now that I was looking at my graph I saw how many days had gone by between practice sessions.
I had estimated that I was already at about 20 hours of practice but now realized that I had grossly overestimated and that it was more like 8 hours.
</p>
<p>
  I set the rate on
  <a href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/j2jenkins/guitar\\">
    my Beeminder graph
  </a>
  at 30 minutes a day and the Yellow Brick Road was laid out for me.
Shit, that line was steep.
Luckily they give you a week head start on any goal so I had time to ramp up and get ready.
I hadn&#8217;t put any money on the line yet.
I just saw that line and knew I didn&#8217;t want to drop below it.
</p>
<p>
  <a href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/j2jenkins/guitar\\">
    <img
      class=\\"aligncenter\\"
      title=\\"Jake's yellow brick road to musical mastery\\"
      alt=\\"Jake's yellow brick road to musical mastery\\"
      src=\\"http://www.beeminder.com/j2jenkins/guitar.png\\"
    >
  </a>
</p>
<p>
  I started practicing on a more regular basis and entering my data into Beeminder.
I loved entering new data and watching my graph update instantly.
</p>
<p>
  I quickly realized that Beeminder allowed you some flexibility in achieving your goals that I had never considered.
Before, if I had been really engaged and practiced for 60 minutes straight on Saturday, I would have counted that as one practice session and would have felt like I needed to practice again on Sunday to meet my goal.
</p>
<p>
  With Beeminder I could now visually see that by having an extra long practice session I had created a whole extra day of safety buffer.
That means I can skip a practice that week or have shorter practices on a number of days.
</p>
<p>
  I find that it is harder to find time on weekdays and often can only play for 20 minutes.
So that means I am 50 minutes behind my goal by the end of the work week.
Since I have built up a buffer I am able to draw on that and still stay above the yellow brick road.
On the weekends I can practice for longer and rebuild my safety buffer.
</p>
<p>
  Beeminder triggers all of these thoughts just by graphing my data AND providing the yellow brick road to keep me on track.
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    People often use the excuse, &#8220;I am not disciplined enough&#8221; as a reason for avoiding goals.
The truth is that you just haven&#8217;t found the right way to hold yourself accountable.
  </em>
</p>
<h2>
  You Don&#8217;t Need A Lot Of Discipline
</h2>
<p>
  Whenever I tell people about the progress I&#8217;ve made towards my dream of learning guitar they often say &#8220;you must have so much discipline.  I could never do that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
  They couldn&#8217;t be more wrong about me or themselves.
</p>
<p>
  I am a classic
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/wantcanwill/\\">
    Akratic
  </a>
  who struggles to take a multi-vitamin in the morning, floss every day, or eat healthy on a regular basis.
I struggle with all of these goals because they are actions I Want to complete, not actions I Need to complete.
</p>
<p>
  I am also a person who procrastinates all the time.
I pack in a rush before a flight and I complete projects by pulling all-nighters.
I put off writing thank you notes until the guilt is overwhelming and I let my clothes pile up on the dresser until the mess is unbearable.
</p>
<p>
  These things eventually get done because they Need to be completed.
</p>
<p>
  So, how do you turn something you Want to do into something you Need to do?
</p>
<p>
  Try making a commitment.
To yourself, to a friend, to Beeminder, or to StickK.
Pick one and try it.
If you fail at first then try a different technique or raise the stakes.
Keep tweaking the commitment until you start making progress towards your goal.
</p>
<p>
  You will know you are on the right path when someone says to you, &#8220;you must have so much discipline.&#8221;

<p>
  In April this year I began working with the Beeminder team to redesign their interface. Over three months, I tracked a total of a 167 hours towards the project. But let&#8217;s start at the very beginning.
</p>
<h2>
  Why a Redesign?
</h2>
<p>
  It took me a little while to understand Beeminder when I first started using it. Once I figured it out, it became indispensable. I started and followed through on new habits, projects, and routines more successfully than I ever had before.
</p>
<p>
  My friends liked the idea of Beeminder, or at least found it interesting enough to try, but most of them couldn&#8217;t understand how to use it.
</p>
<p>
  I got in touch with Beeminder to ask if they planned to redesign the site, because I had some ideas.
</p>
<p>
  To make sure this wasn&#8217;t just my friends, I bought some remote user testing credits to see how strangers handled the interface. I asked the testers to sign up and commit to two different goals and then change their commitment for one of them. None of the participants were able to complete the tasks in the 20 minutes allotted.
</p>
<p>
  This convinced me that Beeminder was too focused on people who were already familiar with the idea of Quantified Self and commitment contracts. I wanted to make it easier for anyone (like my friends) to start using Beeminder.
</p>
<p>
  It turned out my timing was perfect because the Beeminder founders felt the same way and liked the idea of working with someone who already understood Beeminder.
</p>
<h2>
  The Sitemap
</h2>
<p>
  Beeminder is a complex application and there were a lot of bits that needed to be gathered before the project began.
</p>
<p>
  We collected concerns, jobs to be done, and problems to avoid and began sorting them by the type of users they pertained to.
</p>
<p>
  The existing sitemap listed out 211 pages. Many of these pages overlapped and a lot of similar functions spread across multiple pages were consolidated.
</p>
<p>
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/josh1.png\\">
    <img

      src=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/josh1.png\\"
    >
  </a>
</p>
<h2>
  Flowcharts
</h2>
<p>
  We focused on building flowcharts that linked the most critical functions first.
</p>
<p>
  For example, this is an early flowchart that connects signing up to starting your first goal:
</p>
<p>
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/josh-flow.png\\">

      src=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/josh-flow.png\\"
    >
  </a>
</p>
<p>
  We worked outward until I had all the functions mapped and each of the sequences interlinked. This was our first working draft:
</p>
<p>

    >
  </a>
</p>
<h2>
  Wireframes
</h2>
<p>
  Once we had an overview of how everything was going to fit together we began to lay out the most important elements for each of the screens.
</p>
<p>
  We started with mobile screens. The lack of digital real estate forced us to only focus on the essential elements for each screen:
</p>
<p>
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/josh-wire.png\\">
    <img
      src=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/josh-wire.png\\"
      class=\\"aligncenter\\"
      title=\\"Wireframes for mobile\\"
      alt=\\"Wireframes for mobile\\"
    >
  </a>
</p>
<p>
  The wireframes were not supposed to look good, they were just meant to work. We stitched them together to create a  low-fidelity prototype so we could see how well the new signup process worked with real people.
</p>
<p>
  Each time we showed the prototype to a new user they were asked to complete three tasks. There was significant variance in the age and occupational background of these early testers so I only changed something if 3 people brought it up.
</p>
<p>
  This process went on for about two weeks until people could finish all their tasks without any problems or questions.
</p>
<p>
  With the mobile wireframes stabilised, we progressed to wireframing the screens for tablet and desktop resolutions:
</p>
<p>
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/josh-tabletwire.png\\">
    <img
      src=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/josh-tabletwire.png\\"
      class=\\"aligncenter\\"
      title=\\"Wireframes for tablets\\"
      alt=\\"Wireframes for tablets\\"
    >
  </a>
</p>
<h2>
  Typography
</h2>
<p>
  Most of what you see on a screen is type. Type is in the content, navigation, on buttons, in headings, and everywhere else. Given how much space words occupy, we worked on selecting the typefaces before we got involved in designing the individual components.
</p>
<p>
  The display font we selected is Trueno Semi Bold. We wanted a typeface that was indistinguishable from the old logo typeface. Of all the options shortlisted, Trueno letterforms had the most space inside the letters, making it the most readable.
</p>
<p>
  The display typeface was for headers, titles and buttons. At first we paired it with Roboto Regular as a body typeface. We needed something that matched the display font but was also legible at small sizes and in large blocks of text:
</p>
<p>
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/josh-type.png\\">
    <img
      src=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/josh-type.png\\"
      class=\\"aligncenter\\"
      title=\\"Lorem ipsum\\"
      alt=\\"Lorem ipsum\\"
    >
  </a>
</p>
<p>
  Eventually we moved to Source Sans for the body. We didn’t want to use a third typeface to bridge the two fonts so we went with Source Sans pro so that we could use the body font in ALL CAPS as a third font.
</p>
<h2>
  Components
</h2>
<p>
  With the wireframes and typography in place we began focusing on designing the smallest and most common components on every page. Starting with the smallest bits first helped establish visual rules that we could then follow for the rest of the design.
</p>
<p>
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/josh-bits.png\\">
    <img
      src=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/josh-bits.png\\"
      class=\\"aligncenter\\"
      title=\\"UI elements\\"
      alt=\\"UI elements\\"
    >
  </a>
</p>
<p>
  For example, setting the margin spaces on the smallest components decided things like spacing patterns when the components came together to form larger chunks.
</p>
<p>
  We drew on examples of how other applications in the system solved equivalent problems. We needed elements that behaved the same to look the same. At the same time it was important for elements that behaved differently to appear different and be inconsistent. In most cases we followed conventions to prevent unnecessary confusion.
</p>
<p>
  We tried to keep Beeminder&#8217;s nerdy, data-centric aesthetic while adding a touch of sporty to the mix. Sporty because of the 2 out of 6 goals types, and 8 out 21 integrations, are fitness related.
</p>
<h2>
  Colour
</h2>
<p>
  Up till this point we were relying on proximity and contrast to distinguish elements. Designing everything in grayscale meant that we could now use colour as a tool to draw attention to the most important parts of a page.
</p>
<p>
  We used a high contrast yellow and black for the typeface. Beeminder is an application that takes your money if you don&#8217;t get things done. This is serious and it&#8217;s important that the interface doesn&#8217;t try and hide this.
</p>
<p>
  One approach was to limit the interface to two colours. Orange for alerts and a single yellow hue at different intensities to indicate the severity of a goal.
</p>
<p>
  We also tried the existing 4 colour palette but adjusted it so that the colours were more accessible for the colour blind.
</p>
<p>

    alt=\\"Stoplight colors\\"
  >
</p>
<p>
  In the end we balanced the existing palette so that the colours complemented the high contrast yellow and black used for the typeface.

<h2>
  Layouts
</h2>
<p>
  With the wireframes set, the typography decided, the components designed and the colour in place the last step was to finalise each of the 70+ webpages.
</p>
<p>
  Initially there were three types of screens. The first were the main screens. Dashboard and goal pages, where people spend most of their time.
</p>
<p>
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/josh-main.png\\">

      class=\\"aligncenter\\"
      title=\\"Main screens\\"
      alt=\\"Main screens\\"
    >
  </a>
</p>
<p>
  Then there were the transition screens. Anything that is part of a process. Signing up, setting up a goal, connecting your card, etc.
</p>
<p>
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/josh-transition.png\\">
    <img
      src=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/josh-transition.png\\"
      class=\\"aligncenter\\"
      title=\\"Transition screens\\"
      alt=\\"Transition screens\\"
    >
  </a>
</p>
<p>
  The idea was to make these pages jarring. They represent being in the middle of a process and the point was to either move forwards or backwards, but not hang around.
</p>
<p>
  The last type of screen is any kind of setting screen.
</p>
<p>
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/josh-settings.png\\">
    <img
      src=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/josh-settings.png\\"
      class=\\"aligncenter\\"
      title=\\"Settings\\"
      alt=\\"Settings\\"
    >
  </a>
</p>
<p>
  People spend more and more time on settings pages as they transition from beginners to regular users. The idea was to make things much easier on the eyes than transition screens but still distinguish them from the main pages.
</p>
<h2>
  Design as an Error Correcting Process
</h2>
<p>
  At this point we started testing the new designs on existing users. We needed to understand how the changes affected usability for Beeminder power users.
</p>
<p>
  Testing the new design with existing users led to a huge round of changes.
</p>
<p>
  For example, the dashboard and gallery pages had been merged into a single dashboard. This new dashboard looked a lot like the gallery but it became clear that there was a preference for the table layout from the the old dashboard.
</p>
<p>
  Another major change was that the goal setup process focused on the purpose of the goal before it asked you about integrations. This made it easier for beginners to design goals without being overwhelmed by all the third party integrations. For existing users this meant too much hand holding, so we moved the integrations page to the front of the process.
</p>
<p>
  These changes necessitated a new round of user tests since all the tests up to this point were invalidated. We no longer knew how difficult the new setup process was for newbees. Rather than testing the site as a mockup, we began coding the designs and decided to run the next round of tests on an early build of the actual platform.
</p>

<h2>
  Some Things I Learned
</h2>
<p>
  As a web designer, I am horrible at justifying design choices and formulating persuasive arguments for why something should be done a certain way. My approach so far has largely been based on the unsupported belief that good design should speak for itself.
</p>
<p>
  As a web designer it is my responsibility to be able to explain basic principles of design and then communicate the benefits of using them. I have to outline how and where these principles have been implemented and then connect the benefits back to the larger goals for the project. This process takes a huge amount of time to do. However, if a few extra hours of clear communication prevents something from being designed by committee then it will save everyone a lot more time and money redoing the work. It is therefore my responsibility as a web designer to prevent it from happening.
</p>
<p>
  Another thing I learned is that I should have designed a pattern library. Beeminder added lots of new features and changed their entire pricing structure in the time that it was being redesigned. Now I have committed to shipping an HTML and CSS UI library of all the components with any design work I do. This way my clients have all the blocks to rearrange and build new elements as they need to.
</p>
<p>
  This was by far the most interesting design project I have worked on so and I am incredibly grateful to the Beeminder team for giving me the opportunity.
</p>
<p>
  I would also like to thank everyone who took the time to test the interface as it was being designed. Your feedback was essential, and I appreciate your help.

  “I can’t believe 2017 is almost over.”
</p>
<p>
  If you haven’t heard that yet, prepare yourself. 
It’s coming. 
It’s the twin to 
“Can you believe it’s June already? 
I feel like it was just New Years!” 
Time goes by fast, oftentimes shockingly so.
</p>
<p>
  Now think about something that you’ve been wanting to do that will take you a long time to accomplish. 
For me it was writing a book, and given that millions of people have the same goal, you may well want to write one too. 
But it is a big mountain to climb. 
So big, in fact, that most people never get around to getting the words out of their head.
</p>
<p>
  The difference between getting that book out of your imagination and into the world lives in that “I can’t believe it’s already June” space. 
You can write a full-length novel in six months. 
That may sound daunting if you haven’t done it before, but I promise, it goes by fast.
</p>
<p>
  Now here’s the guy-in-a-shiny-suit sales pitch: 
you can write that book of your dreams with just a few small payments of 500 words each. 
I wrote my first two novels at a pace of 500 words a day. 
That’s 200,000 words 500 words at a time. 
By the third book, writing 500 words was easier so I kept going, cutting my completion time by two months.

  Give up the idea that writing happens when you feel the artistic urge to sit down and work
</h4>
<p>
  BEGINWC[BODY2]
There is one thing I had to give up to make this happen:
the idea that writing happened when I was feeling the artistic urge to sit down and work. 
With my new goal, I didn’t have to write a lot, but I had to do it every day. 
It’s not always easy.
Sometimes the right words don’t find their way to the forefront of my mind, but there is no negotiation. 
If the word count isn’t 500 words more than what it was yesterday, I don’t get to go to sleep.
</p>
<p>
  This takes willpower and determination, two things I didn’t have enough of to get me through a full novel, let alone the three I wanted to write for this trilogy. 
When I was in high school, I had a teacher tell me I was “the queen of that’s good enough.” 
Some people are born with an internal drive to push themselves to do their best work. 
I had to work at it, and I needed help.
</p>
<p>
  This is where Beeminder comes in&#8230; 
Of course, there are the financial repercussions of falling behind, but I also got to see my progress. 
Every dot on my graph really felt like a step up that mountain. 
Every entry became a reward. 
Every gap a representation of stagnation.
</p>
<p>
  Here&#8217;s what it looked like for my first book &#8212; 90,169 words in six months in 2015:

I’m writing this to take the elusiveness out of writing that book in your head.

  Not so bad, right?

  I just completed one of the biggest projects of my life: a jazz art event for over 500 students from the
  <a
    href=\\"http://pdxjazz.com/education/jazz-in-the-schools/\\"
    title=\\"Jazz hands!\\"
  >
    Jazz in the Schools program
  </a>
  and several hundred of their biggest fans. 
It involved multiple community partners, a team of volunteers, a radio interview, 250 works of art, a grand piano, and every bit of my brain power. 
I am proud to say the event was a success. 
I am exhausted, relieved, and overwhelmed with gratitude for my awesome coworkers and volunteers.
Amazingly, I also still have friends and a partner who remember what I look like.
My teeth are still shiny white, my fitness improved during this time, and I didn’t drink too much.
</p>
<p>
  I have Beeminder to thank for all of that.
</p>
<p>
  Beeminder is the accountability tool that helps me maintain my me-ness. 
It keeps me doing all the things I consider crucial to my happiness or health. 
I have never had trouble getting work accomplished but in the past I have struggled with caring for my own basic human needs during big projects. 
It turns out, I
  <em>
    can
  </em>
  do both!
</p>
<p>
  Here are the goals that helped me most during the time leading up to the big event:
</p>
<h3>
  Running
</h3>
<p>
  This one is simple. 
I’m planning to run three marathons in 2018, so maintaining a solid mileage base is critical. 
This goal is automatically linked to my Garmin watch. 
I appreciate the data magically appearing on my graph with zero effort or thought on my part.
</p>
<h3>
  BK Fitness
</h3>
<p>
  This fitness goal helps me stay in shape while simultaneously spending quality time with my partner, Brad. 
We meditate, run, and do strength training sessions. 
Even if my days were really long, I knew that we would have a dedicated time to connect each day.
And these fitness-based goals kept me energized, strong, at a healthy weight, and allowed me to begin marathon training
  <em>
    during
  </em>
  the last weeks leading up to the big event.
</p>
<h3>
  Gratitude
</h3>
<p>
  Keeping a

    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/gratitude/\\"
    title=\\"Old Beeminder blog post about gratitude journaling\\"
  >
    gratitude journal
  </a>
  maintains my focus on the positive things in my life. 
I used to do this online but now have a handy section in my
  <a
    href=\\"http://www.passionplanner.com/\\"
    title=\\"Thanks, Celeste\\"
  >
    Passion Planner
  </a>
  that allows me to write out all the wonderful things that happen each week. 
(Can I say, I sure am passionate about my Passion Planner!?) 
Gratitude journaling is one of those things I’ve done off and on for years, but with Beeminder I am much more consistent.
</p>
<h3>
  Flossing
</h3>
<p>
  I am absolutely obsessive about dental hygiene but after a few 20 hour workdays, even I think it might be ok to skip the important step of flossing daily. 
Beeminder makes it so I stay on top of this. 
After reading Brent Yorgey’s

  &#8212; 
especially &#8220;don&#8217;t get rid of easy goals&#8221; &#8212; I am even more committed to keeping this goal. 
Thanks for sharing, Brent!
</p>
<h3>
  Alcohol
</h3>
<p>
  This is mostly for tracking rather than accountability but it&#8217;s handy for reminding me to only have one drink or less. 
I do a lot of socializing and I live in Portland, Oregon, a town famous for its boozy bounty. 
This is an easy way to keep track of every alcoholic drink I have had.
It really makes me aware of having even just one glass of wine which can lead to two which often leads to poor sleep and sluggish runs the next day.
</p>
<h3>
  PalPower
</h3>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;Beeminder kept me aware that it was time to touch base with my support network&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  This is my absolute favorite goal because it is time I spend with friends
  <em>
    not
  </em>
  working. 
This social time used to be the first thing I neglected when I was down to the wire on a deadline. 
Beeminder kept me aware that it was time to touch base with my support network.

  Here is photo evidence of said happiness and satisfaction:

  Having all the jazz (and eating it too)
</h2>
<p>
  It might have been hard to stay on top of all these personal things, despite Beeminder’s nagging, if I hadn’t integrated them into my existing workflow alongside my work responsibilities. 
Now, I self-identify as the least tech-savvy Beeminder user, but much to my surprise, it was super easy to connect my Beeminder alerts to my Google calendar by using this handy
  <a
    href=\\"https://ifttt.com/applets/EN6eKxwH-add-beemergency-days-to-your-google-calendar\\"

    title=\\"Beeminder&#39;s If This Then That integration, aka, ifthismindthat.com\\"
  >
    IFTTT
  </a>
  .
My calendar alerts me when a Beeminder goal is in the red. 
This has been incredibly helpful when I am letting emails slide and I have all notifications silenced on my phone to focus on my work. 
Having that second layer of warning allowed me to note when I was going to have a beemergency and plan accordingly.
</p>
<p>
  I wasn’t perfect. 
Well, actually, I was practically perfect. 
The only time I derailed was because of a tracking problem. 
I had done the work but failed to get it logged. 
If I had taken the time, I could have replied to the 
&#8220;

    explained
  </a>
  that I had done the task but forgotten to log it and the fine folks at Beeminder would have corrected the derailment. 
If you’ve never interacted with support, you might not realize just how friendly and helpful they are! 
(Trust me, they’re all wonderful!) 
This time, I chose to take the derailment because I really don’t mind paying a little to an app that clearly gives me so much value (and it was
  <em>
    only
  </em>
  $5).
</p>
<p>
  Now that Beeminder helped me achieve my greatest professional accomplishment to date by prioritizing the things that make me a healthier, happier, and more productive Kim, I am ready to tackle my next project with confidence. 
Thanks Beeminder! 
I honestly could not have done it without you!

    killing off auto-widening yellow brick roads

<h2>
  Background: Yellow Brick Whatnow?
</h2>
<p>
  To start at the very beginning&#8230; 
The Yellow Brick Road is the path on your graph that starts at the current value of the metric you&#8217;re minding and ends at where you want it to be, or perhaps soars upward indefinitely. 
(Related reading:

    Why Beeminder likes cumulative graphs
  </a>
  .) 
Historically the yellow brick road has been defined in terms of the centerline and then so-called lanes on each side of that. 
The lane on the good side of the road we called being in the blue and represented two days of safety buffer. 
On the bad side of the centerline was being in the orange which was one day of buffer. 
(If you&#8217;re thinking of a standard do-more goal then &#8220;good&#8221; means above the road and &#8220;bad&#8221; below, but this is reversed for do-less or weight loss goals.)
</p>
<p>
  That turned out to be a horrible design choice, brutally complicating all sorts of things that should be simple, like computing how much safety buffer you have, especially when the slope of the road changes.
</p>
<p>
  Yellow Brick Half-Plane means scrapping the concept of lanes. 
Instead of defining the road in terms of the centerline, it&#8217;s defined in terms of the critical edge. 
Then you can still have colored zones defined in terms of the number of safe days. 
This has a million implications for the implementation but the primary user-visible difference will be that the thing you&#8217;re editing with the 
road dial (in the Commitment tab under your graph)
or the
  <a
    href=\\"http://road.beeminder.com\\"
    title=\\"Experimental visual road editor\\"
  >
    experimental visual road editor
  </a>
  is the one bright line that you can&#8217;t end the day on the wrong side of.
(Also it&#8217;s fixing a lot of bugs and inconsistencies. 
I don&#8217;t want to oversell it or anything but it&#8217;s going to be better than a box of kittens.)
</p>
<h2>
  The Thing We&#8217;re Changing Now&#8230;
</h2>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;A wider road is conceptually no different than a razor thin road that&#8217;s shifted to wherever the critical edge of your custom-width road was&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  &#8230;is simply that you can&#8217;t pick the width of your yellow brick road.
But that never really made sense.
The only thing that ever matters is where the critical edge is &#8212; the bright line that you can&#8217;t let your datapoints cross.
Or, technically, can&#8217;t be on the wrong side of when your daily deadline hits.
So a wider road is conceptually no different than a razor thin road that&#8217;s just shifted to wherever the critical edge of your custom-width road was.
</p>
<p>
  There&#8217;s one aesthetic sense in which that&#8217;s not quite true and that&#8217;s the visual indicators and the colors of the graph.
If you think of orange as &#8220;danger zone&#8221; then previously you could customize what that means exactly.
So that&#8217;s a tiny step backwards
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"PDP1\\"
    href=\\"#PDP\\"
  >
    [1]
  </a>
  that will soon be more than made up for as we complete the Yellow Brick Half-Plane transition.
The Yellow Brick Half-Plane is all about focusing only on that bright line.
</p>
<p>
  I guess we can also mention one other ridiculous sense in which it&#8217;s not true that this change is functionally inconsequential.
Namely, cheaters.
We had never gotten around to implementing any constraints on changing your road width so unscrupulous users could&#8217;ve &#8212; not that anyone would ever do this &#8212; cheat by widening their road when they were about to derail.
Which is a good place to rest our case on killing this abomination of a feature.
</p>
<h2>
  What If I&#8217;m Already Using Custom Lane Widths
</h2>
<p>
  It turns out there aren&#8217;t actually too many of you so we&#8217;re emailing all of you and making sure the transition is smooth.
Stay tuned!
</p>
<p>
  UPDATE: That happened, y&#8217;all should&#8217;ve gotten emailed, and custom lane widths are now fully and completely a thing of the past.
Hooray!

<h3>
  The problem with language learning
</h3>
<p>
  This is not an inspirational blog post about how it only takes thirty
days to learn a language.
Learning a language takes serious time and effort!
I&#8217;ve studied languages and worked with others in their own learning journeys. 
My experience has been that common problems in this process relate less to language itself and more to things like motivation, accountability, and structure of various kinds.
</p>
<p>
  Luckily for all of us, we have Beeminder! 
The best practices of language-learning encourage students to be specific in their goals. 
It&#8217;s hard &#8212; dare I say impossible? &#8212; to make a Beeminder goal without being specific about what exactly you want to do and how often you want to do it. 
In fact, one of the biggest problems for language learners using Beeminder seems to be too much ambition. 
(A few too many

<h3>
  Systems, not goals
</h3>
<p>
  One of my favourite Beeminder blog posts to share with students and friends has always been 
&#8220;
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/systems/\\"
    title=\\"An old Beeminder blog post on setting up systems to incrementally progress towards targets\\"

    Systems Not Goals
  </a>
  &#8221; 
from 2015. 
Language learning is certainly an arena where you need to have solid time expectations &#8212; this stuff takes time &#8212; though it doesn&#8217;t hurt to have some short-term sprint goals early on.
</p>
<p>
  In fact, having more sprints earlier on in your overall trajectory is probably a good idea. 
Once you are at an intermediate level in your language studies, it is far less likely you&#8217;ll forget all of your vocabulary or syntactical structures. 
If you give up earlier on &#8212; because you&#8217;ve been ploughing along with Duolingo on a backburner-level five-points-per-day rate, perhaps &#8212; then you&#8217;re more likely to lose all of your progress completely.
</p>
<p>
  Beeminder, like many of the most useful tools, is what you make of it. 
It relies on its users&#8217; best sense and instincts as much as it relies on a particular design impulse or workflow. 
The same is true for language learning. 
You will have to have an honest conversation with yourself about what you specifically hope to do with a language.

  Say you have a hard deadline in a month and you know you&#8217;ll end up down to the wire. 
You check the exact time of the deadline and see that it&#8217;s 9am. Groan! 
That portends a brutal all-nighter. 
Why (oh why) couldn&#8217;t they have made it 9pm the previous night? 
(Same story for deadlines that are timed so as to ruin a holiday.)
</p>
<p>
  Note that that lamentation is patently crazy.
</p>
<p>
  Nothing prevents you from setting your own deadline 12 hours ahead of the real one. 
But I&#8217;ve heard such lamentations often, including from myself. 
Such people are classic
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/akratics\\">
    akratics
  </a>
  and should derive huge value from forcing themselves to make steady progress as the deadline approaches, eliminating that all-nighter. 
They rarely do though.
Instead they (we) resolve to pretend the deadline is earlier, and then throw that pretense out the window and pull the all-nighter on the last night anyway.

  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/competitors\\">

  ) are offering something hugely valuable for such people.
</p>
<p>
  Next week we&#8217;ll blog about one such person solving that problem beautifully with Beeminder. UPDATE:
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/gandalf\\">

  </a>
</p>
<h2>
  Layaways
</h2>
<p>
  Here&#8217;s another example of
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/akrasia\\">
    akrasia
  </a>
  : failure to save up for an important purchase, like a new washing machine.
This is a real problem for people living on a limited income and with poor credit &#8212; a combination which has been more common since the financial crash of 2008.
What&#8217;s needed for akratics such as these is a way to force yourself to gradually set aside small amounts of money until you&#8217;ve saved up enough for the big purchase.
  <a href=\\"http://www.newyorker.com/talk/financial/2012/01/02/120102ta_talk_surowiecki\\">
    As James Surowiecki points out in The New Yorker last month
  </a>
  , an old solution to that problem is regaining popularity in the current recession:
  <a href=\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layaway\\">
    layaway
  </a>
  .
</p>
<p>
  As with all commitment devices, using a layaway is superficially irrational.
You&#8217;re strictly better off setting the money aside in a bank account, earning interest and retaining flexibility to reevaluate the purchase.
But you&#8217;re akratic, so the money won&#8217;t stay in that bank account long enough.
Thus a commitment device, even a somewhat

<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;Here&#8217;s our rule of thumb&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  But what are good criteria for deciding if a derailment is legitimate?
Sometimes the circumstances that led to a derailment make it ambiguous.
Here&#8217;s our rule of thumb:
If you had thought to spell it out in your fine print for the commitment contract, would you have chosen to have an exemption for circumstances like these?
</p>
<p>
  Ideally we want two things to be true any time someone goes off their yellow brick road and loses a pledge:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    It was due purely to
    <a
      href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/akrasia\\"
      title=\\"Inaugural post on the Beeminder blog about &#39;How To Do What You Want&#39;\\"
    >
      akrasia
    </a>
    .
  </li>
  <li>
    The motivation that Beeminder provided up until the derailment was worth more than the amount paid.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  The ideal might be unreachable because we need objective criteria for when the pledge should be forfeit.
(Though even that we&#8217;re not sure about &#8212; would it work to just ask you if you felt the derailment was akratic? 
(UPDATE 2021: Our answer is now no. We&#8217;ve had some users over the years who&#8217;ve tried to use that as their criterion and it&#8217;s pretty awful.))
</p>
<p>
  As a bare minimum so far, we&#8217;ve been using this policy:
Is there anything the platonic ideal of Beeminder could&#8217;ve done to prevent this derailment?
Maybe better reminders, like separate SMS reminders just for emergency days?
</p>
<p>
  If so (if you can tell us so with a straight face) then we don&#8217;t count it as a legit derailment.
Unless of course you checked the &#8220;weasel-proof me&#8221; box.
</p>
<p>
  UPDATE: The &#8220;weasel-proof me&#8221; checkbox is something you have to opt in to in the goal&#8217;s settings.
(A previous update clarified that this was different from the &#8220;I swear not to weasel&#8221; checkbox that everyone had to check as part of goal creation.
We got rid of that, mostly because of this confusion. 
There&#8217;s always an implicit promise not to weasel when you create a Beeminder goal.
The &#8220;weasel-proof me&#8221; checkbox is specifically authorizing us to be hard-nosed in the face of ambiguously extenuating circumstances.
We now, in 2021, have further plans to replace weaselproofing with something we&#8217;re calling &#8220;no-excuses mode&#8221;. Stay tuned!

  :
We&#8217;ve renamed the Set-A-Limit goal type to Do Less. 
The names &#8220;do more&#8221; and &#8220;do less&#8221; sometimes confuse people, like if you just want to maintain a steady rate of something, or not do something at all.
The idea is that you use a Do More or Do Less goal to do more or less than what you&#8217;d otherwise do if left to your own devices.
</p>
<p>
  Beeminder&#8217;s been very do-more-centric. 
We&#8217;re great at encouraging you to do more of the good stuff, like exercising or writing.
Unfortunately, we were bad at setting a limit on undesirable behaviors, which seems like it should be part of our bread and butter!
So bad in fact that our own esteemed cofounder and Queen Bee, wanting to do less gorging on sugary treats, devised a rather convoluted way to turn that into a Do More goal. 
She
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/box\\"
    title=\\"Beeminding Outside the Box, in which we describe this and other creative beeminding\\"
  >
    has a goal
  </a>
  that keeps her doing more
  <em>
    not
  </em>
  eating sugar.
</p>
<p>
  It&#8217;s been long overdue that we overhaul the inner workings of limiting / Do Less goals.
We&#8217;ve changed a few things and now they are (nearly?) analogous with Do More goals (hence the name change).
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      We came up with an equivalent to Do More&#8217;s week of initial
      <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/glossary/#flatspot\\">
        flat spot
      </a>
      to ease you into the goal. 
Do Less goals give you a starting week of buffer by starting the road above you. 
If you want to drink 1 cup of coffee per day, then you start at 0 and the road starts at 7 &#8212; giving you one week of buffer. 
If you keep to your goal and drink only one cup of coffee per day you&#8217;ll still have an extra 7 cups of leeway.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If you cross the centerline of your Do Less goal, we send you a warning email.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If you ignore us and don&#8217;t report, you will eventually derail.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  This is the biggest change, and most important to making Do Less goals really stick.
</p>
<p>
  Until now, if you forgot to report to Beeminder for a given day, the default thing was to assume that you
  <em>
    didn&#8217;t
  </em>
  have any coffee, or whatever behavior you are limiting. 
This
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/glossary#flatline\\">
    flatlining
  </a>
  behavior where we assume that by default you did nothing, is the reasonable thing to do in the case of a running or blogging goal.
But with a Do Less goal you could weasel your way out of your commitment just by being forgetful, which,
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/weasels\\">
    as we&#8217;ve already established
  </a>
  is dangerous, particularly for Beeminder users.
Beeminders are surprisingly non-weaselly but they are often weasels of omission.
</p>
<h2>
  Pessimistic Presumptive Reports
</h2>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;Edit me, slacker!&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  So now we&#8217;ve changed the game. 
At the end of the day if you haven&#8217;t entered a datapoint on a Do Less goal, then we add one for you, and we assume the worst. 
This pessimistic presumptive report is twice whatever the current daily rate of the yellow brick road is.
That has the nice property that you&#8217;ll transition from green to blue to orange to red, one per day, just like with flatlining on a Do More goal.
We also annotate the datapoint with the comment &#8220;PESSIMISTIC PRESUMPTION. Edit me, slacker!&#8221; so they&#8217;re easily distinguishable.
This means that if you ignore your Do Less goal, instead of slowly gaining more and more safety buffer, you instead climb closer and closer to the road, and will eventually derail for lack of reporting data.
</p>
<p>
  This also means that if you really
  <em>
    didn&#8217;t
  </em>
  drink any coffee today, you need to enter an explicit &#8220;0&#8221; datapoint. 
If you simply forgot to enter your data you can go back and edit it to the correct amount.
</p>
<p>
  Our intent is to light a fire under your butt to keep paying attention to those Do Less goals. 
Prior to now they were all too easy to forget about and let slide. 
This is on by default for new Do Less goals (excepting autodata goals, since they already report on you whether you&#8217;re paying attention or not).
If you want it on for one of your existing goals, look for it in your goal settings.
If you want to opt out of it, again, it is in settings. 
Of course, in our quest to keep all our users&#8217; cranial orifices free of
  <a

  >
    sand
  </a>
  , 
we think you should leave it on.
</p>
<p>
  UPDATE: Pessimistic presumptive datapoints now automagically self-destruct when you add a real datapoint!
So that&#8217;s slightly easier than editing them.

We take efforts like that as very strong votes for an official, built in autodata integration.
Since Lichess also has a beautiful API, that put it over the top.

You create a Lichess-playing Beeminder goal on a screen like this:
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
  Yes, you have to specify a fraction if you want to commit to less than one game per day.
The math all checks out though.

  Here&#8217;s Robert Perce with more on Lichess vs Chess.com:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
    Lichess is an open-source nonprofit with no paywalled features.
Chess.com is a for-profit company with a freemium model. 
On the free plan you get only limited analysis of games.
The flip side is that Chess.com&#8217;s income stream means they can do a lot more sponsorship of tournaments, clubs, and players.
They do a lot for the growth of chess.
The marketing budget for Chess.com means they have a larger userbase as well.
    <br>
    &nbsp;
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
    Elo ratings are not directly comparable between the Lichess and Chess.com. 
Mid-range Elo is typically about 200 points higher on Lichess but it diverges widely on the ends.
    <br>
    &nbsp;
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
    I personally strongly prefer Lichess&#8217;s interface but both are good.
    <br>
    &nbsp;
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
    There&#8217;s a perception that Lichess has more cheaters because it&#8217;s free but that&#8217;s broadly unfounded.
    <i>
      Playing
    </i>
    is free everywhere, and bots don&#8217;t need computer analysis of their games.
    <br>
    &nbsp;
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
    And, yes, &#8220;the cool kids version of Chess.com&#8221; is how I think of it.

  Their (meta) goal is the same as ours.
They want to &#8220;eliminate willpower as a factor in achieving goals&#8221;.
</p>
<p>
  Our approaches, however, are quite opposite. Or at least they have opposite sign.
Lift emphasizes in their
  <a href=\\"http://blog.lift.do/post/25435255834/everything-there-is-to-know-about-lift\\">
    pre-announcement blog post today
  </a>
  that they believe firmly in positive reinforcement.
Beeminder, of course, is all about negative reinforcement.
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"REN1\\"
    href=\\"#REN\\"
  >
    [2]
  </a>
</p>
<p>
  We&#8217;re not arguing that negative reinforcement is better, just that positive reinforcement is not really something you can use on yourself.
If you&#8217;re shaping other people&#8217;s (or animals&#8217;) behavior then by all means, reward desired behavior.
Why not on yourself as well?
Because the positive reinforcement &#8212; the reward &#8212; has to come from somewhere. 
If you yourself have access to it then, well, it&#8217;s yours already. 
So you can pretend you&#8217;re giving it to yourself to reward your successes but really all you have the power to do is abdicate it if you fail. 
Which makes it, ultimately, negative reinforcement.
</p>
<p>
  That&#8217;s not to say you can&#8217;t go a long way with myriad tricks and techniques, like environmental triggers and feedback loops and social support.
Beeminder tries to encompass all of those &#8212; daily bot reminders, data visualization, encouraging you to make your goals public and even
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/chirpify\\"
    title=\\"Yay Chirpify!\\"

    tweeting your failures

  .
</p>
<p>
  But the real point of Beeminder, as with our biggest competitor,
  <a href=\\"http://stickk.com\\">

  </a>
  , is that it&#8217;s a
  <a href=\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commitment_device\\">
    commitment device
  </a>
  , which is where the negative reinforcement comes in.
For some people that&#8217;s more of a sledgehammer when they just need a chisel but if you&#8217;re the type who tries a menagerie of chisels only to eventually fall off the wagon &#8212; and, come on, you&#8217;re reading a blog post arguing with another blog post about principles of behavior change, so probably you&#8217;re exactly that type &#8212; then maybe the idea of just breaking out a sledgehammer is appealing.

  So, Beeminder users, by all means, use Lift to help you stay on your yellow brick roads.
And Lift users, try Beeminder if you find yourself falling off the Lift wagon.
Or as insurance to make sure you don&#8217;t!
</p>
<p>
  There&#8217;s one way in which Beeminder and Lift are very much on the same page: our attitudes toward gamification.
Lift originally was all about gamification, &#8220;making you as addicted to living a good life as you might be to playing video games or slot machines.&#8221;
They&#8217;ve now dropped all the points and levels and badges to focus on the core psychology.

  I&#8217;ve had swiss cake rolls on my mind since Kevin McGowan&#8217;s
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/foodhabits\\">
    delightful guest post last week
  </a>
  .
Then today I saw a special: four boxes of Little Debbie snacks for $5. So cheap!
</p>
<p>
  If only it were possible to buy them and not immediately start shoving them into my maw one after the other until stopped by physical pain. If then.
You can perhaps guess where this is going. I bought 8 boxes &#8212; that&#8217;s 96 treats, 15,000 calories! &#8212; and am beeminding my consumption.
These babies are going to last till May or I owe you, Dear Reader, $100.

<p>
  Per usual with Beeminder goals, I have to stay on or below that road every single day.
No inhaling all but one cake roll, saving that one till May 1st, and claiming the stash technically lasted.

  Addendum
</h2>
<p>
  I&#8217;m sufficiently home-free on this goal now that I might as well declare early victory.
It really worked like a charm. (There were many times when, the moment the clock struck midnight, I snarfed up exactly as many of these things as would take me right to the top edge of the yellow brick road.)

  and I are actually thinking of making a Beeminder-aware cookie jar (&#8220;Beemind your Gluttony!&#8221;) that sends a &#8220;1&#8221; to your sugar graph every single time you open the lid, and glows the appropriate color for how much safety buffer you have.
</p>
<p>
  There was one downside to rationing these treats: The remaining swiss cake rolls are actually slightly stale now. I never knew that could happen. How could I? I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever had a box of swiss cake rolls last overnight before, let alone 2 months.

  Beeminder&#8217;s solution to the problem of akrasia is to increase our short-term motivation for actions that are in our own long-term interest (but wouldn&#8217;t get done otherwise because they require a certain amount of unpleasant effort). 
It does that by punishing failure. 
This is a great solution for a wide variety of problems, especially anything that can be framed as a &#8220;do more&#8221; goal.
</p>
<p>
  For some &#8220;do less&#8221; goals (eat less candy, browse social media less often, etc.) there is another strategy available, however: 
Making it harder or outright impossible to do these things in the first place.

Lock My Phone does exactly what its name promises. 
Just tell it when &#8212; and where &#8212; you&#8217;d like your phone to be unavailable. 
Want to lock yourself out in the evening so you have an easier time going to bed? 
(That’s what I do.) 
Or maybe in the morning when you&#8217;re at work so you can get more things done? 
No problem, just enter the time and address of your workplace and feel like Ulysses resisting the sirens.

<p>
  While this strategy works surprisingly well, I soon noticed a big drawback: 
If you&#8217;re a Beeminder user with multiple goals in need of daily updates you better make sure you put in the data before your phone gets locked in the evening. 
Otherwise you&#8217;re not only causing more unnecessary work for yourself tomorrow &#8212; but also for

    Automate
  </a>
  that conveniently lets you add datapoints from the notifications bar. 
This works because Lock My Phone never prevents you from interacting with the notifications on your lock screen, even while your phone is locked. 
(You can also always receive calls and call the police or emergency contacts. 
You just cannot unlock your phone to text back, open apps, etc.)

      This is part 1 of a two-part series.
First we explain loss aversion and how it&#8217;s distinct from the endowment effect.
(Spoiler: loss aversion is a generalization of the endowment effect.)
Asking Google how those things are different currently yields a fog of opaque logorrhea, so we hope this is enlightening.
We&#8217;ve also collected some cute examples to convince you how irrational loss aversion is.

      Part 2 might be embarrassing.

    </em>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  The endowment effect is like a &#8220;but it&#8217;s miiiine&#8221; bias &#8212; an irrationally increased value for the feeling of owning something.
Not that valuing anything &#8212; even (especially) vague feelings &#8212; is necessarily irrational.
It&#8217;s only irrational if you&#8217;re inconsistent.
The most familiar example of irrational/inconsistent preferences may be addiction,
  
where you want something but you don&#8217;t
  <em>
    want
  </em>
  to want it.
The endowment effect is a bit like that.
</p>
<p>
  Imagine you&#8217;d pay up to $100 for a snozzwobbit.
So your value for it &#8212; including the warm fuzzy feeling of owning it &#8212; is $100.
That means losing the snozzwobbit &#8212; and the concomitant warm fuzziness &#8212; should drop your utility by that same $100.
If not, then something fishy has happened.
</p>
<p>
  Of course there are a million ways to rationalize such asymmetry.
Maybe you didn&#8217;t know how much you&#8217;d like the thing until you experienced it, or you just don&#8217;t want to deal with transaction costs or risk of getting scammed.
But if we control for all those things &#8212; and many studies have tried to do so &#8212; we can call the asymmetry the endowment effect.
</p>
<p>
  Loss aversion is more general.
Technically it means having an asymmetric utility function around an arbitrary reference point, where you think of a decrease from that reference point as a loss.
Again, the weirdness of a utility function isn&#8217;t itself irrational. 
You like what you like!
But the arbitrariness of the reference point can yield inconsistencies which are irrational.
You can reframe gains and losses with a different reference point and people&#8217;s utility function will totally change.
</p>
<p>
  Consider the
  <a
    href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allais_paradox\\"
    title=\\"Includes a nice color-coded table of the choices that the paradox presents people with\\"
  >
    Allais paradox
  </a>
  .
Imagine a choice between the following:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    A certain million dollars
  </li>
  <li>
    A probable million dollars, a possible five million dollars, and tiny chance of zero dollars
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  People mostly prefer the certainty, which is entirely unobjectionable.
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"RISK1\\"
    href=\\"#RISK\\"
  >
    [1]
  </a>
  Now imagine this choice:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    A probable zero dollars and possible million dollars
  </li>
  <li>
    A slightly more probable zero dollars and slightly less possible five million dollars.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Now people feel like they might as well go for the five million.
And &#8212; here&#8217;s the paradox &#8212; you can put numbers on those &#8220;probables&#8221; and &#8220;possibles&#8221; such that the choices are inconsistent.
Rationally, either five million is sufficiently better than one million to be worth a bigger risk of getting nothing, or it&#8217;s not.
But it doesn&#8217;t feel that way.
In the first choice you can guarantee yourself a million dollars. 
You don&#8217;t want to risk losing that by taking option 2 and ending up with bupkis.
In the second choice, neither option has any guarantee.
You&#8217;re choosing between different possible gains with different probabilities.
</p>
<p>
  Thus is your reasoning distorted.
</p>
<p>
  If you&#8217;re talking about your utility for snozzwobbits then the obvious reference point is the number of snozzwobbits you currently own.
If your utility for an additional snozzwobbit is much less than your disutility for giving up one of your snozzwobbits, that&#8217;s suspicious.
Still not inherently irrational;
maybe you have just the number of snozzwobbits you need and one more would be superfluous.
But if we see that same asymmetry &#8212; how much you&#8217;d pay for an additional snozzwobbit vs how much you&#8217;d sell one for &#8212; regardless of how many snozzwobbits you own, that&#8217;s irrational.
</p>
<p>
  So there you have it.
The endowment effect is a kind of loss aversion where your arbitrary reference point &#8212; as in your value for snozzwobbits &#8212; is however many you currently own.
And the Allais paradox example shows that literal endowment/ownership isn&#8217;t required for this cognitive bias to appear.
</p>
<p>
  Let&#8217;s drive this home with some less abstract examples.
</p>
<h3>
  Garage Space
</h3>
<p>
  Here&#8217;s a partially real-world example, courtesy of my sister.
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    World A
  </em>
  : 
Your car doesn&#8217;t fit into your garage. 
By spending $1000 you can have the garage widened or something. 
No way, you say, we&#8217;ll just keep the car outside.
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    World B
  </em>
  : 
Your car
  <em>
    does
  </em>
  fit in your garage and you&#8217;re offered $1000 to have it not fit anymore. 
Maybe your neighbor offers you that to store their car in your garage. 
No way, you say, can&#8217;t give up that garage space.
</p>
<p>
  But those are inconsistent. 
What&#8217;s the value to you of having your car fit? 
If less than $1000 then you were right in World A but wrong in World B. 
If more than $1000 then it&#8217;s the other way around. 
There&#8217;s no good way to rationalize saying no in
  <em>
    both
  </em>
  worlds, but people do.
</p>
<p>
  I say &#8220;no good way&#8221; which invites a lot of nitpicking and well-actuallying.
There are uncertainties to account for, or social dynamics with your neighbor, blah blah blah.
But when the discrepancy between willingness-to-pay and willingness-to-accept is big enough, it&#8217;s pretty suspect.
A factor of two seems to be common in some experiments.
</p>
<h3>
  Lawn Mowing
</h3>
<p>
  You know how people will mow their own lawn or change their own oil because it seems extravagant to pay someone $20 to do something they can perfectly well do themselves?
But if a neighbor offers to pay
  <em>
    you
  </em>
  $20 to mow
  <em>
    their
  </em>
  lawn then you say no. 
That&#8217;s inconsistent! 
I mean, at some point you&#8217;d run out of time but if it makes sense to turn down the neighbor&#8217;s offer to mow your lawn then you should also accept when your neighbor offers $20 to mow theirs. 
Either it&#8217;s worth $20 to get out of a lawn mowing or it isn&#8217;t.
</p>
<p>
  And, again, you can always find excuses. 
Maybe you don&#8217;t trust someone else to do as good a job, or don&#8217;t know if they&#8217;ll be happy with how good a job you do.
It makes sense for there to be a gap between willingness-to-pay and willingness-to-accept.
Just that people seem to have nonsensically high gaps.
</p>
<h3>
  Buying vs Getting Bumped From Flights
</h3>
<p>
  This is an example Bee and I spotted in the Boston airport
  <a
    href=\\"https://forum.beeminder.com/t/beeminder-boston-meetup/9623\\"
    title=\\"Beeminder Boston meetup\\"
  >
    one Sunday
  </a>
  in August.
</p>
<p>
  First, imagine you&#8217;re buying flights and there&#8217;s a flight at a much more convenient time, saving you basically a day of wasted travel time, but it costs $800 more.
Almost everyone (in my socio-economic circles) chooses to save the $800.
</p>
<p>
  Then you get to the gate for your flight and the flight is overbooked and they&#8217;re asking for volunteers to be bumped to a flight that&#8217;s 8 hours later and they&#8217;ll pay you $800 in actual money, not those  scammy airline vouchers.
Almost everyone chooses to stay on the flight they have (we checked!).
</p>
<p>
  This means people are probably being irrational, either to save the $800 in the first case or to not take the $800 in the second case!
</p>
<p>
  Can we rationalize this one?
Easily. An unexpected 8-hour travel delay may be much worse than a similar delay you can plan for. 
But plenty of people are plainly being inconsistent/irrational in these situations.

  You have to twist yourself into especially tangled knots to rationalize this one.
</p>
<h3>
  Decluttering
</h3>
<p>
  I personally very much suffer from the endowment effect bias and I try to consciously override it. 
When cleaning house and it feels hard to throw something away, I can sometimes snap myself out of it by reframing the question: 
&#8220;What would I pay to acquire this? Oh, right, zero dollars. 
So my loss aversion is irrational and this is zero skin off my nose to throw away!&#8221;
</p>
<h3>
  Beeminder
</h3>
<p>
  What if Beeminder is telling me to, I don&#8217;t know, publish a blog post and I&#8217;m staring bleary-eyed at a pile of notes and I really don&#8217;t want to?
But also I&#8217;m really averse to being charged money, and so I get the dang post out the door?
Is that not fighting irrationality with irrationality, for the greater good?
</p>
<p>
  Nope, we&#8217;re doubling down.
</p>
<p>
  In part 2 we&#8217;ll make our case for fighting irrationality with rationality instead.
(Spoiler: that still means using Beeminder.)

<p>
  I&#8217;m worried this whole blog post will sound banal but I&#8217;m gradually learning to tell that inner critic to shut up.
This is hard-won wisdom, people!
In fact, it&#8217;s been a helpful guiding principle for us for years now and we&#8217;ve caused ourselves a lot of grief by violating it in the past, before we got our heads around it.
</p>
<p>
  The Anti-Magic Principle says software shouldn&#8217;t do anything seemingly magical.
It should be as simple and transparent and predictable and convention-following as possible. 
This can apply to big things like

    title=\\"Feature Unannouncement: Auto-Widening Yellow Brick Roads Have Gone Manual\\"
  >
    the auto-widening yellow brick road
  </a>
  . 
(Facepalm!)
And more commonly it applies to little things like suppressing the display of a checkbox in the UI when it&#8217;s not applicable.
(When a user remembers that a checkbox used to be somewhere and now it&#8217;s not, that&#8217;s confusing and frustrating!
Better to gray something out than to have it magically disappear.)
</p>
<h2>
  More Examples
</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      It turned out to be a bad idea to let the default date for the add-data form magically update to the new day when the deadline hit.
It seemed so reasonable at the time but led to confusion and frustration when coming down to the wire on adding data.
Dumb and predictable and slightly wrong can be better than impeccably right but surprisingly clever.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Having data magically know to display in HH:MM format because you used the string &#8220;hours&#8221; as your goal units: bad idea.
(And, embarrassingly, we haven&#8217;t yet fixed this! 
Long story, and all the more reason to have the principle to prevent us from doing things like that in first place!)

      if you had more than 10 goals.
That&#8217;s the only time it makes sense to have a search button, sure, but it&#8217;s better to just always have the button, even if you only have one goal.
Otherwise you&#8217;ll have users thinking they&#8217;re crazy because they saw the button last week and now they have 9 goals, having crossed a threshold wholly opaque to them, and, rage-emoji.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Now our heuristic is to follow anti-magic slavishly, at least at first.
It&#8217;s easier, implementation-wise, anyway.
Deploy it that way and see how it feels.
Only then consider adding the magic, like not showing both thingies if they&#8217;re identical or whatever.

<p>
  We don&#8217;t think so!
For example, in the last example above, POLA could suggest that users won&#8217;t expect a search button when they only have one goal.
Anti-magic makes it more clear: just be dumb/consistent, user-surprise be damned.
Or check out the standard

  . 
Trying to minimize user surprise by doing what they meant instead of what they said tends to backfire.
</p>
<p>
  Likewise, anti-magic goes beyond mere simplicity.
In the third example above, our whole motivation was to make things simpler for newbees.
But it violated anti-magic and anti-magic was correct.

    Worse is Better
  </a>
  &#8221;?
That takes anti-magic to a seemingly ridiculous extreme but I&#8217;m kind of a believer in that too.)
</p>
<p>
  You can well object that a magically appearing/disappearing search button is what&#8217;s more surprising or that magically suppressing confusing UI elements because we think you&#8217;re a newbee is less simple, and in one sense you&#8217;re right.
Either POLA or KISS might always give the right answer if you look at them the right way.
But that&#8217;s what it means to be a guiding principle: 
it&#8217;s the thing that actually induces you to look at it the right way.

  , 
and is certainly an admirably full work week, especially considering that&#8217;s 87 hours of tagged time, i.e., time that was unambiguously on task, and not just 87 hours at the computer.
I pushed 69 commits to GitHub, compared to 16 in the previous week, closed 19 Trello cards, and did 50 45-minute chunks of focused work (or 37.23 hours). 
Out of 122 TagTime pings at the computer, only 6 of them were
  <em>
    not
  </em>
  working on Beeminder, and of those, only 3 were labeled as &#8220;smack&#8221;.
The other 3 were switching music and entering my own Beeminder data.
</p>
<p>
  Here&#8217;s my Beeminder hours graph, to compare last week with this:

</p>
<p>
  So despite the more qualified success compared to Nick Winter&#8217;s epic 120-hour work week, I got a lot out of this, enjoyed it more than my average work week, and intend to do it again.
It&#8217;d be great to experiment over the summer with more non-traditional work-hour arrangements with Danny. 
Maybe trade weeks of intense work with weeks of vacation or something.
</p>
<p>
  My biggest frustration during my maniac week was not having a good enough task list to work on. 
There were several things that would have been fun to dive into but weren&#8217;t sufficiently well spec&#8217;d out and required further discussion with Danny about how they should be implemented, etc. 
It was also hard to keep sitting at the desk. 
A standing desk surely would be nice for mixing up working posture. 
Getting up and stretching and walking around the room were not anti-productive in the way that being distracted by non-work is, but nontheless took away from total working hours.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to all the work I accomplished, I made some discoveries about why my productivity sucks (when it sucks). 
So, here are some productivity tips! Or, the reasons why this was an awesomely productive work week for me.
</p>
<h3>
  1. Don&#8217;t ever read email
</h3>
<p>
  This might have been the biggest thing. 
I
  <em>
    closed my email tab
  </em>
  . 
And then I only opened it again a few times throughout the week. 
The rest of the time I got to just not care about what was rolling in.
Maybe Danny and I can try out being each other&#8217;s secretary for a week at a time. 
If that works out I might consider

    title=\\"Maneesh Sethi explaining how he outsources his email\\"
  >
    outsourcing it permanently
  </a>
  .
</p>
<h3>
  2. Do a large number of Pomodoros (or Tocks as we call our 45-minute variant)
</h3>
<p>
  Also, announce the tocks
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.rescuetime.com/2014/05/14/a-little-hack-that-made-our-remote-team-not-feel-so-remote-anymore/\\"
    title=\\"RescueTime blog post about related Hipchat hacks\\"
  >
    publicly (and automatically) on Hipchat
  </a>
  to ensure against weaseliness about what&#8217;s worth counting as a tock.
</p>
<p>

    title=\\"TagTime is a nerdy tool for stochastic self-sampling -- time-tracking for space cadets, as we call it\\"
  >
    TagTime
  </a>
  -based 
hours goal. 
There&#8217;s so much unfocused futzing that legitimately counts as Beeminder work.
</p>
<h3>
  3. Put your phone across the room, turn off notifications, and sign out of messengery apps
</h3>
<p>
  I signed out of Google chat in my browser and on my phone. 
I turned off the sound on my phone, closed out my email tab, put my phone physically far away from me, and face down so I couldn&#8217;t see notification lights. 
I turned off notifications for our Beeminder Hipchat. 
This all meant that I had to consciously engage in external stimuli. 
I also told everyone I knew that I was going off the grid for a week, so there weren&#8217;t nearly as many notifications to begin with. 
This was awesome because checking on the external world became a conscious decision that I had to get up from the computer to do. 
Obviously it would be easy to slowly stop the habit of putting your phone far away from you. 
But that&#8217;s fixable with a commitment device.
</p>
<h3>
  4. Decide today what you&#8217;re going to work on tomorrow
</h3>
<p>
  One evening partway through I found myself kind of frustrated and not sure what to do next. 
So as my final tock for the day I carefully curated a list of tasks to do
  <em>
    tomorrow
  </em>
  . 
This seems like a great idea. 
And it made it really easy to get started the next morning because I sat down and my list told me what to do.
</p>
<p>
  Theoretically I could have spent my tock curating a list of tasks to work on, and then started in on them the next tock. 
But it was nice to close out with a little planning ahead for tomorrow and then take a break and sleep.
</p>
<h3>
  5. Hack your /etc/hosts to block flow-breaking or distracting sites
</h3>
<p>
  This is a really basic thing, and is really just an extension of #3: 
I put a line in my /etc/hosts file that redirected my most-visited distracting sites to localhost. 
Then even if I did make the mistake out of habit of launching one of those sites in a tab, it didn&#8217;t resolve to the site and let me get sucked in. 
Not that I couldn&#8217;t have gone and edited my /etc/hosts file again to get around it. 
But what it did for me was raise the bar of distraction to taking intentional action. 
I couldn&#8217;t launch a beloved comic and start reading and find myself 15 minutes later completely off task when TagTime pings. 
Instead I launch the beloved comic, get an &#8220;oops&#8221; page from Chrome, and remember that I&#8217;m supposed to be doing something else. 
I also had #6 working for me in this regard&#8230;
</p>
<h3>
  6. Take a screen shot every minute
</h3>
<p>
  This obviously exerted huge constant pressure to stay on task.
Key of course is the expectation that you&#8217;re going to show it off in a blog post!
</p>
<h3>
  7. Walk away from the computer when you are done
</h3>
<p>
  This was lovely. 
I know it was billed as a week of solid work.
But I found that really difficult to deliver on, working every waking hour, but I was incredibly efficient while I was working at the computer.
There were a few days I was worn out and didn&#8217;t feel like I had any stamina left for thinking about things and coding, but wasn&#8217;t exactly tired.
Because of the Maniac commitment (and the screenshots enforcing it), on those days I stepped away from the computer and wrote, or even read some poetry one night. 
It was really nice to
  <em>
    stop work
  </em>
  intentionally and leave the computer to do anything else. 
I&#8217;m so often fussing and futzing over Beeminder things in every spare moment.
</p>
<h3>
  8. Live at your office
</h3>
<p>
  This is something Danny and I have debated for a while, and it turns out he&#8217;s right and I&#8217;m wrong. 
I think I still have some value for leaving my house to work in general. 
There was something distracting about working out of our actual house when we did that for a year. 
But Danny is right that our current commute is too much. 
It means that we frequently make sub-optimal decisions about where/when/how to work.

<h3>
  Beeminding weight loss
</h3>
<p>
  Our rationalization of auto-widening starts with weight loss.
Beeminder and weight loss go way, way (weigh) back.
The first lines of code that would eventually become Beeminder 
(
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/beenamer/\\"

  >
    12 years ago!
  </a>
  ) were to draw a yellow brick road to your goal weight on a graph.
But we noticed that one of the biggest problems with losing weight is that your progress is rarely steady from day to day, so that it doesn&#8217;t feel like a measurement that is wholly under your control.
There are causes behind these fluctuations that careful attention can tease out.
For one person it&#8217;s eating salty foods, or drinking a beer; for another it is having a uterus.
But they commonly make weight loss bewildering and frustrating.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;It was circular logic&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  Beeminder used to try to mitigate the pain of that for you, with the afore-mentioned elaborate magic to adjust the width of the road.
But that doesn&#8217;t make it any easier to lose weight.

    title=\\"Alternate title: Catch-up Unmustered\\"
  >
    Making goals easier makes them harder!
  </a>
  Tampering with the road width just makes the failure condition more murky.
Ultimately, we decided that it&#8217;s much more valuable to have a single, predictable, immovable bright line.
And

</p>
<h3>
  &#8220;Stay below this line and you won&#8217;t derail tomorrow&#8221;
</h3>
<p>
  Without getting too far into the depths of the Rube Goldbergian auto-widening concept, we claimed to give you a guarantee that if you kept your weight below a particular bright line &#8212; the centerline of your yellow brick road &#8212; then we&#8217;d guarantee, by auto-widening your road, that you wouldn&#8217;t derail tomorrow.
This was circular logic! 
If you can actually stay below that bright centerline then you can just as well stay below the even brighter you-actually-derail-if-you-cross-this-line line. 
If you
  <em>
    can&#8217;t
  </em>
  actually stay below the centerline, which, of course you can&#8217;t, then the whole point is right out the window and you&#8217;re skating the real line anyway.
</p>
<p>
  Also, realistically, no one was motivated by that guarantee anyway, not even us, since it was so hard to understand.
</p>
<p>
  The one thing that auto-widening did for you was let you postpone choosing the right amount of initial safety buffer.
But it&#8217;s much cleaner to just make you guess your maximum daily weight fluctuation at the start,

    Stanford Marshmallow Experiment
  </a>
  concluded that preschool kids who could resist gobbling a marshmallow for 15+ minutes in order to earn two marshmallows went on to become more successful adults.
The original explanation was that kids with the ability to delay gratification 
(like by coming up with beeminder-y tricks to distract themselves from the tempting marshmallow) 
are served well by that skill for the rest of their lives.
This was based on the original experiments

  plus multiple followup studies over decades to track the kids&#8217; life outcomes.

  that the kids who were able to delay gratification as preschoolers got better SAT scores in high school.

  >
    a study by Kidd et al
  </a>
  called that explanation into question.
It suggested that those seemingly impulsive kids are just the kids who don&#8217;t trust the adults who promise the second marshmallow. 
They&#8217;re thinking &#8220;yeah, I&#8217;ve heard that before&#8221; and gobble while the gobbling&#8217;s good.
In other words, they&#8217;re not failing to delay gratification, they&#8217;re responding to the situation perfectly rationally based on their past interactions with adults.

  So flaking on your kids ruins their lives?

<p>
  Well, those diligently patient 2-marshmallow kids did grow up to be markedly more successful.
If that can be attributed to kids learning very early in life to rely on promises from adults, then heck yes, be diligent about following through on everything you promise to your kids.

    title=\\"Revisiting the Marshmallow Test: A Conceptual Replication Investigating Links Between Early Delay of Gratification and Later Outcomes\\"

    a study by Watts et al
  </a>
  came out aiming to disentangle Mischel et al&#8217;s claims &#8212; learning to delay gratification as a preschooler makes the rest of your life better &#8212; from Kidd et al&#8217;s claims, that the kids with the impressive outcomes are merely the ones brought up by more impressive adults.
</p>
<p>
  If the second claim is true then the whole cottage sub-industry in education involving teaching kids self-control would be a waste of time.
</p>
<p>
  The good news is that Watts et al used a much bigger sample size and focused on more disadvantaged kids.
The bad news is that the conclusions are all quite nebulous and mostly not statistically significant.
Also the way they separated their sample into kids whose mothers completed college or not sure looks suspicious
(they have excuses for doing that; I&#8217;m not sure if they&#8217;re legit).
They conclude that the correlation between self-control and life outcomes is there but at most half as strong as Mischel et al claim.
They don&#8217;t seem to address Kidd et al&#8217;s theory that the 1-marshmallow kids are behaving perfectly rationally given their history with unreliable authority figures.
</p>
<p>
  The biggest problem with all of this research is that there are no randomized controlled trials anywhere to be found.
No causation can be established.
Maybe it&#8217;s all just that kids delay gratification simply because they&#8217;re literally smarter and everything else follows from that.
  <a
    href=\\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2005.01641.x\\"
    title=\\"Self-Discipline Outdoes IQ in Predicting Academic Performance of Adolescents\\"
  >
    Other research
  </a>
  suggests self-control matters as much or more than intelligence in predicting life outcomes, but either way, we just don&#8217;t have good evidence for the efficacy of any particular interventions.
</p>
<p>
  My tentative conclusion from all this is that, first of all, sure, self-control as a kid is predictive of good life outcomes.
Second &#8212; and this is based more on common sense than any of the research &#8212; parents and educators should give kids tools to augment self-control.
(Like Beeminder! At least when they&#8217;re old enough to grok money.)
Finally, modeling reliability for your kids sure can&#8217;t hurt.

  astutely pointed out that the &#8220;gobble while the gobbling&#8217;s good&#8221; rationale doesn&#8217;t hold too much water.
As long as there&#8217;s even a
  <em>
    probability
  </em>
  of getting the second marshmallow, that&#8217;s worth the wait.
Unless you view the adult as so unreliable that they&#8217;re liable to snatch the first marshmallow back from you if you don&#8217;t gobble it.
I&#8217;m glad that possibility didn&#8217;t occur to my 11-year-old.
Look how much trust and reliability we&#8217;re modeling!

  For the sake of technical correctness (the best kind of correctness) I should point out that correlation doesn&#8217;t imply causation and even if that interpretation of the marshmallow experiment is correct, it needn&#8217;t be that flaking on your kids ruins their lives. 
It could be that flaky parents just have flaky kids and it&#8217;s all genetic so there&#8217;s nothing you can do about it!
But maybe be accountable for things you say to your kids just in case, is my point.

  This is an interesting case study.
Martin put $5k at risk on a very conservative goal &#8212; spending at least 8 hours a week on a house renovation project for a total of 249 hours by May 5.
He actually signed the contract on Oct 21, right before he started shooting up above his yellow brick road.
He maintained a blazing pace until the holidays.
Then sometime in January he hit the 249 hours, making his $5k safe, and you can see what happened to his productivity since then:

<p>
  You may have heard the term &#8220;Maniac Weekend&#8221; around these parts before.
It refers to a focused, concentrated 2.5-day period where one tries to cram in as much focused work time as possible.
Sometimes these weekends have actually been Maniac Weeks, requiring as much focus as possible over the course of a week 
(requiring locking oneself in the basement, or in Bee&#8217;s case
  <a

    title=\\"The story of Bee&#39;s first Maniac Week\\"

  </a>
  ).
</p>
<p>
  This ritual usually involves a timelapse of your screen during your Maniac Time, as pioneered by Nick Winter in his

<p>
  The timelapses look great and the proposal of getting all the productivity in is tantalizing, but clearing the hurdle of finding an entire free weekend to schedule and send the kids to Canada is relatively challenging. 
So Danny proposed this compromise: Doing a maniac week in pieces.

  to join in on Maniac Mornings / Midnights in the Month of May.
</p>
<p>
  This means each day you carve out a 2-hour &#8220;maniac morsel&#8221; when you can ignore the outside world to do focused work
You do the screen captures and images of yourself working your butt off. 
At the end of the month you stitch it all together to make a single timelapse.
</p>
<h2>
  It&#8217;s totally not too late to dive in with us!
</h2>
<p>
  Here are the rules:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    You should use this time for focused work - here at Beeminder we&#8217;re defining that as &#8220;creating things&#8221; like code or writing - but you can choose whatever makes sense for you.
  </li>
  <li>
    Mornings are great but you should pick a 2-hour chunk of time when you&#8217;re most awake. Any time before midnight. (If it&#8217;s after midnight then it counts as morning of the next day.)
  </li>
  <li>
    You just need 60 total hours in the month so you get one freebie day. If you haven&#8217;t started yet, that would be yesterday!
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  This used to require a

  </a>
  that takes the screenshots every 30 seconds and displays the nice clock on your screen.
</p>
<p>
  At the end of the month, we&#8217;ll do a short post on how you can pull together your fancy timelapse in under 30 minutes from the Maniac Clock folders. 
And then we&#8217;ll show off all our timelapses!
Don&#8217;t worry too much about the end result timelapse though, focus on getting your work done! 
Worrying about the video editing is putting the Maniac Cart before the Maniac Horse.

<p>
  I&#8217;ve always struggled with a systematic approach to my workflow, so when I saw Beeminder mentioned on some blog years ago I thought it sounded worth a try.
It didn&#8217;t take long before I was in deep.
I even got a fancy premium plan for features like
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/glossary/#autoratchet\\"
    title=\\"Beeminder glossary entry for auto-ratchet. In short, it automatically shifts your yellow brick road every day so you can never accumulate safety buffer.\\"
  >
    auto-ratchet
  </a>
  and pledgeless goals (no money at stake).
</p>
<p>
  In fact, nowadays almost all of my goals are pledgeless.
It turns out that works for me.
Maybe I just need a small nudge to be sufficiently systematic, maybe I don’t really need Beeminder anymore, or maybe I’m just geeky enough to be motivated by a nice-looking graph more than by financial penalty.
But it doesn&#8217;t matter why &#8212; it works, so I&#8217;m not changing it!
</p>
<h2>
  How and what I beemind
</h2>
<p>
  For things I want to do every day, here&#8217;s the simple scheme I&#8217;ve settled on:
Create a binary do-more goal &#8212; entering a 0 or 1 each day, depending on whether I did what I needed to or not &#8212; with a slope of 0.8 per day and a maximum safety buffer
of 2 days.
That gives me some leeway, but not too much.
In my experience, this works really, really well.
</p>
<p>
  Most of my other goals, though, are do-more goals with “minutes spent” as the datapoints.
</p>
<p>
  As for what I beemind, well, here&#8217;s a small sample of the things I&#8217;ve accomplished thanks to Beeminder:

  Caution! Nerds only beyond this point! (or: How I automate data entry with Emacs)
</h2>
<p>
  One problem I had with Beeminder was its user interface.
The web UI is, let’s say, not the best one imaginable (although I generally hate web apps’ UIs).
The Beeminder Android app&#8217;s UI is the best by far, and from the very start I used it the most.
</p>
<p>
  But it has one big drawback.
It’s not Emacs.

<p>
  The thing is, I live in Emacs.
Non-Emacs users won&#8217;t understand but we Emacsers tend to hate doing anything digital in any other application.
Emacs is much more than a text editor: it’s almost an operating system, and a general way of approaching UIs.
Its main features are discoverability and extensibility unmatched by any other thing in IT.
My Emacs, with all add-ons I&#8217;ve installed, has about 15000 variables determining its behavior, and almost 200 of them contain settings suiting me personally.

  I use Emacs as my text editor for both code and prose.

<p>
  One of the killer apps for Emacs is Org-mode.
It started in 2003 as a note-taking mode for Emacs, and grew to include a hypertext authoring system, a to-do list, a time-tracking tool, a spreadsheet, and a lot more.
It is difficult to describe Org-mode in a paragraph, but the internet is full of blog posts, tutorials, and videos about how it can transform your life.
As a simple example: while reading an email in Emacs, I can press some key combination to pop up a window with a link to the very message I’m reading, add a deadline, and quickly transform it into a to-do item which will pop up in my agenda a predefined number of days before the deadline, complete with the link to the email.
While working on this task, I can attach subtasks to it, then tell Emacs when I start and stop work on these subtasks, and after I finish, have Org-mode generate a report with a breakdown of how much time each subtask took.
</p>
<p>
  Needless to say, I really wanted to have the task duration information generated by Org-mode be automatically sent to Beeminder.

  It is perfectly suited to how I use Beeminder, but it appears to be general enough for others to use it too.
I strongly encourage you to give it a try, especially if you are already an Emacs user.
It has an extensive readme, so I&#8217;ll only mention some of my favorite features here.
You can sort your goals, not only by the deadline, but also by the
  <em>
    hour
  </em>
  of the deadline
(e.g., a goal with a deadline of 13:00 tomorrow will appear earlier on the list than a goal with a deadline of 14:00 today).
You can filter goals by how much you&#8217;ve done today so that, e.g., you can display only the goals for which you have not done your daily norm.
You can filter by the deadline or by the deadline hour so that you can just display goals with a deadline within 2 days, or only goals due within 2 hours.
You can submit datapoints automatically, e.g., when you clock out (stop tracking the time) in Org-mode.
You can view goal details, including historical datapoints.
This may be especially nice when combined with Emacs’s search capabilities, using strings or regular expressions.
You can also edit past datapoints (and unlike the web and Android clients, this also works for
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/glossary#autodata\\"
    title=\\"An autodata goal is one that Beeminder automatically fetches data for from an external service\\"
  >
    autodata
  </a>
  goals &#8212; occasionally useful when the external service somehow messed up).
</p>
<p>
  You probably could achieve much of what I do without Emacs by integrating Beeminder with some cloud-based time-tracking tools.
I prefer my way, though.
If anything works in a suboptimal way, I can just tweak my (or Emacs’s) code to make it work the way I want.
One example is a proof-of-concept hack I implemented some time ago, where I can have goals called “encrypted-1”, “encrypted-2” etc., with description containing the real title and description, but encrypted using GPG and then base64-encoded.
This way I can have really private goals, which are still displayed “normally” by my client.
Not even Beeminder&#8217;s admins have any way to know what I&#8217;m really beeminding!
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"CC1\\"
    href=\\"#CC\\"
  >
    [2]
  </a>
  Also, with Org-mode all my data are really mine, not sitting there on someone else’s computer without me having access to them.
Yes, you can easily export all your data from Beeminder, but not all services are like that!
</p>

  But wait, there&#8217;s (going to be) more

    It&#8217;s common to use a less nerdy version of this trick by just naming your goals obliquely/esoterically.

    investigated daily streak tracking among modern meditators
  </a>
  .
I was interviewed for the article, but I’m glad I wasn’t quoted now that I&#8217;ve seen her angle:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Type-A people are descending on the ancient practice of meditation and tweaking the quest for inner peace to suit their hard-charging needs &#8212; racking up streaks and broadcasting their running tallies to the world. 
The result, for some: Meditation has never been more stressful.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  She blames self-tracking for defeating the point of meditation, but her examples seem like outliers. 
I suppose my needs are less &#8220;hard-charging&#8221;, but logging and setting goals has only improved my meditation practice. 
Gamerman didn&#8217;t discuss
  <em>
    why
  </em>
  her subjects meditate nor
  <em>
    why
  </em>
  self-tracking is part of their practice, but I find the why much more interesting.
</p>
<p>
  From the outside, meditation looks relaxing, but the actual moment-to-moment experience is often frustrating (especially for beginners). 
Try to close your eyes for just one minute and concentrate on the physical feeling of your breath. 
You&#8217;ll see that your focus is hard to maintain, that your ongoing stream-of-consciousness fights for your attention.

  </a>
  &#8212;
distracts you from the present moment by imposing subjective meaning on your experience. 
Meditation trains you to experience the inner monologue of aversions and desires without accepting them uncritically. 
It can be literally uncomfortable. 
If an itch distracts me from my breath, I focus instead on the
  <em>
    desire
  </em>
  to scratch without acting on it.

a strenuous exercise that raises your baseline capacity for equanimity. 
Like all things that are difficult but good for me, I’m great at making excuses to not do it. 
That’s where Beeminder comes in.

<p>
  I started meditating in 2009, but my practice was on-and-off for years. 
I’d have stretches of near daily meditation, but then travel or illness would get in the way and I’d forget to pick it back up for weeks. 
I joined Beeminder in late 2015 and set a meditation goal with a commitment of five minutes a day. 
Since then,
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/dehowell/meditate\\"
    title=\\"dehowell/meditate\\"

    I&#8217;ve done my daily meditation on six out of every ten days
  </a>
  , 
which is
  <em>
    profoundly
  </em>
  more consistent than before.
</p>
<p>
  Contrary to Gamerman&#8217;s caricature of the quantified meditator, I’m not bothered by missing a day. 
I meditate because it helps me live according to my values.

activities that are direct expressions of my values and would be absurd to sacrifice in favor of some silly streak. 
I can make these trade-offs in peace, because I trust my Beeminder goals to get me back on the cushion within a few days.

<blockquote>
  <p>
    “I’m fairly certain that there is no precedent for this in traditional Buddhist practice,” said Benjamin Brose, associate professor of Chinese religions at the University of Michigan. “Many monks meditate every day for decades, and I have never heard of anyone keeping track.”
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Life in a monastery is structured precisely to make its residents accountable for their spiritual practice &#8212; monastic vows are a commitment contract!
If I was a monk, I wouldn’t need Beeminder to keep my practice on track. 
However, I have a family and an engaging job that occupy the bulk of my days. 
I have to carve out time from the margins for meditation, exercise, reading &#8212; all the things that keep me feeling whole.

<p>
  Ellen Gamerman overlooked how apps like Beeminder and Headspace enable people like me to maintain their spiritual practice among the other demands of our lives.

  There&#8217;s a huge irony in us shipping this feature during the coronavirus lockdown.
Namely,
  <em>
    none of us need it for the foreseeable future
  </em>
  !
Our calendars are like an infinite Euclidean half-plane covered in fresh snow.
</p>
<p>
  (Ok, fine, I floated that claim among some hardcore Beeminder users and they vehemently disagreed.
Examples of why this is great during a pandemic &#8212; which I did not make up &#8212; include
planning a mental health day, 
running a virtual event/conference, and 
getting furloughed from your job and scheduling 3 weeks to study Proust.)
</p>
<p>
  The point is, this new feature is extremely useful when you have something coming up on your calendar that changes your normal routine.
For me, in the Before Times, that was most commonly trips, but it could be anything.
</p>
<p>
  How it works is you click the main menu and look for BREAKS like so:
</p>

</p>
<p>
  You can click those column headers to sort your goals alphabetically or, more usefully, by how much safety buffer they have 
(or by how you&#8217;ve capped their safety buffers, if that matters for some reason).
Then you just click the Take A Break checkbox on every goal you want a break for and fill in the dates.
You can also specify the rate. 
By default that&#8217;s zero to have a full break, but you may just want to make your goal a bit easier while on staycation or whatever.
</p>
<p>
  There&#8217;s a separate section at the bottom for Do Less goals. 
For these, you probably want to allow for a higher rate than usual, rather than a lower one, so that you can relax your &#8220;eat less ice cream&#8221; goal while pouring over Proust.
But the whole page is perfectly general and you can use it for an anti-vacation and make all your productivity goals harder &#8212; and with no ice cream &#8212; for a couple weeks if you want to!

  In the beginning, God created the heavens and the Earth and derailing on a Beeminder goal meant getting a week of respite.
That is still in fact the default.
After derailing you get a week of safety buffer.
It gives you

  to re-evaluate how the goal is working, and time to adjust your Yellow Brick Road or even quit if you&#8217;re over it.
The default week off makes this possible because things that make the road easier have a one-week

    added such an option

  .
</p>
<p>
  For convoluted technical reasons 
(not that the technical reasons are insurmountable; just not on the table quite yet because, well, it&#8217;s technical) 
&#8220;no-mercy&#8221; actually allows 2 safe days that you can do nothing after derailing before you&#8217;ll derail again.
And the original week of respite is actually 9 days of safety buffer.

  The point is, until

The first bit of news is that now you can choose any amount of mercy in between.

<h3>
  Different Types Of Safety Buffer
</h3>
<p>
  What we&#8217;ve said so far applies to Do More goals and glosses over the situation with Do Less.
Do Less goals don&#8217;t take
  <em>
    days
  </em>
  of buffer.
A keen-eyed Beeminder user might have noticed this when
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/glossary/#retroratchet\\"
    title=\\"Beeminder glossary entry for retroratcheting -- tl;dr: getting rid of excess safety buffer\\"
  >
    ratcheting
  </a>
  a goal.
For ratcheting most goals we ask how many days of safety buffer you want to keep, and then move the road in the x-direction, to the left.
</p>
<p>
  But for Do Less goals we talk about your buffer in terms of your goal units (pages, hours, servings, etc) and the hard limit, not days until derailment.
For example &#8220;limit +2 cups of coffee today&#8221; for a coffee goal.
When we recommit such a goal, we give you buffer in the y-direction by moving your road up, above your datapoint.
</p>
<p>
  The recommit buffer setting for Do Less goals is not restricted to integer values from 2 to 9. 
You can give any non-negative value.
</p>
<h3>
  But Weight, There&#8217;s More
</h3>
<p>
  Most goals take either x- or y-buffer, but for weight goals we now give you both. 
Weight goals are special snowflakes.
</p>
<p>
  Needing a configurable y-buffer for weight road recommits was actually the whole instigator for General Mercy.
It all started with a footnote
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"FDD1\\"
    href=\\"#FDD\\"
  >
    [1]
  </a>
  on a now long-overdue blog post about the changes we&#8217;ve been making to weight roads.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;Weight goals are special snowflakes&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  Without getting into the why (I swear, that blog post is coming, now that this one is done!), if you&#8217;ve started a weight road
  <a
    href=\\"http://beeminder.com/changelog#2474\\"
    title=\\"This was a big change to weight loss goals where we use the user-specified max daily weight fluctuation for determining how much safety buffer you start with. And here we&#39;re really stretching the definition of &#39;recently&#39;.\\"
  >
    recently
  </a>
  ,
you might have noticed that they are now razor thin and ask you for an explicit amount of buffer to start you off with &#8212; your maximum daily weight fluctuation.
We give you that buffer when you start, by starting your razor road that much above your initial datapoint.
It&#8217;s up to you to maintain that much buffer if you want to stay robust to your max possible weight fluctuation.
</p>
<p>
  But we didn&#8217;t restore any safety buffer in the y-direction when you derailed and were recommitted. 
We only gave you the x-buffer, and put your razor thin road exactly on top of the derailing datapoint.
</p>
<p>
  Personally I love that.
I hated how in the old version with wide roads, if I derailed my weight goal my road moved to put my offending datapoint right in the middle of the road, with a big wide buffer above me. 
That meant that one bad day not only cost me money, it was allowed to compound into many bad days in a row, which made it easy to backslide. 
Now if I screw up, the road recommits with me right on the edge.
I get a little buffer above where the road previously was (because my derail point is necessarily above the old road), while still having to stay in the game and making progress.
</p>
<p>
  But not everyone loves that. 
Some people want to be more careful around the edge and get a merciful recommit even on weight roads.
With a razor-thin road, x-buffer was no longer sufficient to give you that. 
We needed to introduce y-buffer to the weight road recommits and we needed to let you choose how much you wanted.
So we generalized the concept of mercy (normal derails with a week of respite) vs no-mercy and let you specify how much mercy to get.
</p>
<h3>
  Global Mercy
</h3>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;We generalized the concept of mercy vs no-mercy and let you specify how much mercy to get&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  If you know you want all your goals to always have 3 days of buffer after a recommit (or 5 or 2 or whatever), we&#8217;ve got you covered there too.
There&#8217;s a default mercy setting in the New Goal Defaults section of your account settings that replaces the former &#8220;new goals default to no-mercy&#8221; checkbox. 
It asks for the number of
  <em>
    days
  </em>
  you want by default after a derail. 
That&#8217;s straightforward for goals that take x-buffer, but for goals with y-buffer, it works a little differently.
We don&#8217;t collect a separate value for default-y-buffer in the New Goal Defaults, because any single amount wouldn&#8217;t make sense across all your Do Less goals.
(Consider a &#8220;milligrams of caffeine&#8221; goal which allows 200mg per day vs an &#8220;hours of distracting time&#8221; RescueTime goal which allows 0.5h per day.)
</p>
<p>
  Instead we use the daily rate of the goal, and multiplication technology to set a default that&#8217;s reasonable for each goal&#8217;s own unit-magnitude.

    class=\\"footnote\\"

  This is actually doing as we do for the initial starting buffer on a Do Less goal. 
When you start a new Do Less goal we give you a y-buffer of

  You might have noticed that we&#8217;ve referred only to Do More, Do Less, and Weight goals in this post. 
If you want to get super technical, well, first learn about 
\\\\(\\\\mathit{dir}\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\mathit{yaw}\\\\) 
in our

  .
All clear on the Four Platonic Goal Types? Great!
So goals with 
\\\\(\\\\mathit{dir}\\\\cdot\\\\mathit{yaw}&gt;0\\\\) 
(Do More, Odometer, Weight Gain, Weight Loss, Inboxer, Net Calories) 
get x-buffer and goals with
\\\\(\\\\mathit{dir}\\\\cdot\\\\mathit{yaw}&lt;0\\\\)
(Do Less and Rationing)
get y-buffer.
But also so-called noisy goals (where the datapoints have random fluctuation) get y-buffer.
So Weight goals get both x-buffer and y-buffer.
Inboxer or

    title=\\"Beeminder help article on Whittle Down aka Inboxer goals -- commonly for whittling down the number of messages in your inbox\\"
  >
    Whittle Down goals
  </a>
  are actually conceptually/structrually almost identical to Weight Loss goals but since we haven&#8217;t considered them noisy, they don&#8217;t get a y-buffer.
(As you can perhaps tell, this was all surprisingly intricate to pick apart, refactor, and put back together.
Especially for something that initially seemed eminently straightforward &#8212; generalizing a boolean parameter to a numeric one!)

It was a good discussion, with more than one person averring that posting dummy posts isn&#8217;t as slippery a slope as it seems.
You&#8217;re operationalizing what counts as a blog post as &#8220;anything I&#8217;m not embarrassed to publish!&#8221;
Without Beeminder you might well let your blog go totally moribund, so it&#8217;s still a win.
I guess the point is that it&#8217;s a
  <em>
    little
  </em>
  bit like a fake datapoint but ultimately it isn&#8217;t.
A blog post is a blog post.
And the social accountability of it being public limits how far it can degenerate.

<p>
  We don&#8217;t
  <em>

  So this is embarrassing but we kind of want to do that ourselves today!
Because in the last weekly beemail we ran a poll and promised that the next blog post would be whichever topic won.

  Imagine if signing up for Beeminder meant committing to use Beeminder.
As part of signing up, you&#8217;d create a meta goal measuring the number of total datapoints added on all your other goals.
Now the clock would be ticking to get an object-level goal created and to start adding data to it!
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"AUTOCANCEL1\\"
    href=\\"#AUTOCANCEL\\"
  >
    [1]
  </a>
</p>
<p>
  That vision may be reality soon, now that we have a rough version of a Beeminder Meta integration.
In the meantime, we&#8217;ll let you power users set up such goals yourselves if you want them. 
We do think it makes for a nice Quantified Self metric, to see a graph of the total number of datapoints you&#8217;re adding across all your goals.
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"TEDIUM1\\"
    href=\\"#TEDIUM\\"
  >
    [2]
  </a>
</p>
<p>
  Backing up, the Meta integration means treating Beeminder itself as an official integration where the metric is &#8220;number of datapoints added on any of a list of Beeminder graphs&#8221;.
</p>
<p>
  The most canonical use case for this is probably a weigh-ins goal to pair with your weight loss goal.
This has been a pretty huge pain point for many people (including ourselves) with beeminding weight.
Namely, you hit your goal weight and want to beemind keeping your weight stable, but there&#8217;s a massive loophole.
You can just stop reporting your weight and have infinite safety buffer.
</p>
<p>
  (This can also apply to beeminding the size of your email inbox.)
</p>
<p>
  Even if you just have a very shallow bright red line on your graph &#8212; which we think people should for weight loss &#8212; a milder version of the problem still applies.
You get weeks or months of safety buffer whenever you dip a bit below the line, and then you gradually gain weight while avoiding the scale.
When you finally have to weigh in, you&#8217;ve backed yourself into a corner!
</p>
<p>
  The solution is a meta goal tracking how often you weigh in.
Here&#8217;s mine, which has been connected to my weight goal by IFTTT until now:
</p>
<p>
  <img
    class=\\"aligncenter\\"
    alt=\\"Screenshot of Danny's weigh-ins goal\\"

  >
</p>
<p>
  And of course this is more general than weight and weigh-ins.
Any time you want to beemind a thing and also beemind how often you enter data for that thing, you can now hit up

<h2>
  Gotchas
</h2>
<p>
  One potential thing to watch out for in this initial implementation is that if you have an autodata goal pushing to a meta goal and the autodata goal has plenty of safety buffer but it&#8217;s a beemergency on the meta goal, Beeminder is unaware of the urgency on the autodata goal and may not fetch data fast enough. 
(Normally Beeminder is careful to do a final fetch of autodata before derailing you.) 
As long as you&#8217;re aware of this you can just hit the fetch button on the autodata (main) goal to make sure it&#8217;s fresh in time.
</p>
<p>
  This is really the same principle of 
“this goal is red, what does it need / where does its data come from? I better make sure that data is the latest data!”.
And to be clear, there&#8217;s no delay between the main goal getting data and the meta goal getting its +1 so this is only an issue for an autodata goal that may be waiting on data from the autodata source and a meta goal waiting on that autodata goal. 
We&#8217;re working on making the main goal aware of the meta beemergency and do more frequent auto-fetches so you can safely think about this potential gotcha even less than this.
</p>
<p>
  For manual-data goals &#8212; and some autodata integrations where the integration pushes new data to us immediately &#8212; there&#8217;s no issue here at all.
</p>
<p>
  We&#8217;ve also helped avoid any possible freshness problem by making the choice of deadline be part of goal creation for meta goals &#8212; something we plan to do for goal creation in general anyway.
The UI encourages you to set the deadline on the meta goal slightly after the deadline on the source goal.
</p>
<h2>
  The Future
</h2>
<p>
  We&#8217;re pretty motivated to keep improving this, since we need it for a million crazy use cases for ourselves, Beeminder power users that we are.
High on the list (after smoothing out the above-mentioned gotcha) is the ability to echo datapoints from one goal to another.
We were tempted to start with that version, since technically you can achieve the +1 use case by applying an
  <a
    href=\\"https://help.beeminder.com/article/97-custom-goals\\"
    title=\\"Help doc on custom goals which also documents all the aggday functions. An aggday function determines how all the datapoints for a given day are turned into the official datapoint that&#39;s actually plotted on the y-axis of your graph for that day. For standard do-more goals, that function is just the sum of the datapoints. For odometer goals, it&#39;s the most recent datapoint. For weight-loss goals, it&#39;s the minimum.\\"
  >
    aggday
  </a>
  .
But that&#8217;s pretty deep down the Beeminder rabbit hole and we wanted to make sure the more common use cases &#8212; like the weight + weigh-ins case and the &#8220;beemind entering data&#8221; case &#8212; were accessible to newbees.
(Also we took a straw poll in a daily beemail and 75% of you agreed that +1&#8217;s are the better metric to start with.)
</p>
<p>
  As soon as we have mirroring of data from one goal to another you can have use cases like having both an ambitious goal with a low pledge and a bare-minimum goal with a high pledge, both with the same data that only has to be entered in one place.
</p>
<p>
  Another simple improvement is to let you select multiple source goals all at once when creating a meta goal.
The current workaround is to go to the settings of each source goal and paste in the URL of the meta goal as the destination to push to.
</p>
<p>
  After that we may want to replicate what you can currently do with
  <a
    href=\\"https://forum.beeminder.com/t/ifttt-macros/804\\"
    title=\\"These include time of day, hours/minutes/seconds, extracting numbers from blurbs of text, summing numbers, multiplying them, counting words, and counting characters\\"
  >
    IFTTT macros
  </a>
  to extract and transform data in fancier ways.
Maybe you want to beemind the wordcount from all your Beeminder datapoint comments?
Beemind the time of day that datapoints are submitted?
Or apply exotic functions to your datapoint values?
Tell us your use cases!

We&#8217;ve actually had complaints about auto-canceling subscriptions because auto-repeating subscriptions are a kind of commitment device to get yourself to keep using the service. 
Well we sure as heck have a better solution to that problem!
An overarching meta goal to beemind your beeminding also helps with the common problem that people feel overwhelmed or paralyzed upon signing up.
Having a starter goal like that could really help.
Besides, you&#8217;re signing up for Beeminder because you want to commit to things so why not dive in by committing to use Beeminder itself?

  In the current implemention this is a bit tedious:
you have to go to each source goal and point it at your meta goal, and you have to remember to do that for any new goals you create.
Plus you can&#8217;t currently push data from a source goal to more than one meta goal, so you couldn&#8217;t do this and also have, say, a weigh-ins goal for your weight goal.
We&#8217;re excited to lift these restrictions and hope you&#8217;ll holler at us if you are too!

  , complements Beeminder. 
Complice&#8217;s approach to goals is relentlessly qualitative; Beeminder&#8217;s is relentlessly quantitative.

  Backstory
</h2>
<p>
  It all started when a user messaged me about using the Complice API to build an integration with
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/taskratchet\\"
    title=\\"Beeminder blog post about Beeminder&#39;s TaskRatchet integration\\"
  >
    TaskRatchet
  </a>
  , a to-do list app that bills users for not-done tasks. 
I immediately got dollar signs in my eyes and concluded I should build that into Complice itself.
No, honestly, my main motivation was to implement it in a way that worked with Complice&#8217;s design principles.
</p>
<p>
  One of the core principles of Complice is freshness, as opposed to staleness. 
You&#8217;re never burdened with your past self&#8217;s idea of what you should be doing today. 
You can only set intentions (Complice&#8217;s take on tasks) for today (or tomorrow, once you&#8217;re done with today) &#8212; not further into the future.
</p>
<p>
  So clearly any commitment devices in Complice should work the same way. 
No arriving at a deadline two weeks in the future cursing your past self for committing to something that you&#8217;re totally out of touch with the purpose of now.

    For those sufficiently interested, here&#8217;s an edited transcript of my conversation with Danny when I showed him a protype of the new micro-commitment-contracts feature.
I think it makes a nice case for how I ended up implementing it.
(Danny also thought it might lend credence to his claim in the intro that there&#8217;s no contentiousness here!)

        <b>
          Danny
        </b>
        : I love your Complice stakes feature. 
So much so that I think you should make it opt-out. 
Assume that any task will want some stakes and make the user drop it to $0 if they really don&#8217;t want that.
Opinionated software, etc.

          Malcolm
        </b>
        : First response to that is &#8220;oh god no&#8221;. 
Upon reflection, I can maybe see something beautiful about $-by-default. 
Would need a ton of revamping to actually make it work, but it would sorta make the act of intending way more punchy. 
Though lots of people (including me, half the time) use Complice in a much more open-ended way, like &#8220;here&#8217;s a menu of things I might want to do today&#8221; so this wouldn&#8217;t be a fit for them / that workflow.
        <br>
        <b>
          Danny
        </b>
        : Maybe there&#8217;s two distinct categories: mustdos and maybewannados? 
 
The meta advice could be: agonize until you&#8217;ve decided whether people ought to set stakes by default. 
If so, push it hard. 
If not, don&#8217;t clutter things up by making it an option. 
Kinda related to the

        <br>
        <b>
          Malcolm
        </b>
        : Definitely not. Some things are worth putting money on, others aren&#8217;t. Seems pretty obvious to me.
        <br>
        <b>
          Danny
        </b>
        : That&#8217;s persuasive.
        <br>
        <b>
          Malcolm
        </b>
        : Too many hard constraints means inflexibility. 
Also it would be forcing way
        <i>
          too many
        </i>
        choices. 
Since the current UI has it so you have to pick the time of day it&#8217;s due and that seems correct; 10 tasks due at midnight is a shitshow.
        <br>
        <b>
          Danny
        </b>
        : Ooh, yeah, making stakes part of picking a specific deadline maybe is the best of both worlds?
        <br>
        <b>
          Malcolm
        </b>
        : Exactly. If you want something due at a particular time of day, make it real. 
Gotta have a real consequence, otherwise the deadline isn&#8217;t a deadline it&#8217;s just uhhh a &#8220;time at which we ping you and you feel guilty or something&#8221;.
        <br>
        <b>
          Danny
        </b>
        : Like that&#8217;s the dichotomy. 
It&#8217;s either just a maybewannado or it has a deadline+stakes.
And that can be where you can set the stakes to $0 if you want but it defaults to something positive.
Or get more opinionated and say if there are no stakes then there&#8217;s no deadline.
        <br>
        <b>
          Malcolm
        </b>
        : I am opinionated about that &#8212; no stakes, no deadline. 
Currently $1-100 range.
        <br>
        <b>
          Danny
        </b>
        : Love it. 
You definitely convinced me this is a good design; I retract my initial objections.
        <br>
        <b>
          Malcolm
        </b>
        : The $100 max was partially because the feature is new, but on reflection I think it&#8217;s also just maybe correct, in the sense that this is only for things on the scale of a day, and mostly those shouldn&#8217;t be &#8220;worth&#8221; more than $100. 
And if they are, then the answer is to break it down into a few steps and put $100 on each step and force earlier steps to be due slightly sooner. 
Yeah, that seems right &#8212; just thought that through live right now.
        <br>
        <b>
          Danny
        </b>
        : Smart. No objections there.
        <br>
        <b>
          Malcolm
        </b>
        : Baha I just realized the &#8220;break it into smaller steps and stake them each hour&#8221; is literally the Beeminder principle but applied on the scale of hours rather than days/weeks/months.

  How it works
</h2>
<p>
  What I came up with was a really simple 3-step workflow where you take an intention you&#8217;ve already set for the day, and press a button (or the
  <code>
    $
  </code>
  hotkey) and then you choose:
</p>
<h3>
  1. What time of day you want to finish the intention by
</h3>

</p>
<h3>
  2. How much money you want to stake on doing so
</h3>

</p>
<h2>
  How this complements Beeminder
</h2>
<p>
  Beeminder is a system for moving some gradual needle, measurably, over time. 
It&#8217;s about keeping you on track towards something via doing the same thing repeatedly.
</p>
<p>
  You basically
  <em>
    can&#8217;t
  </em>
  use Beeminder for committing to something later today, and certainly not without committing to the same thing every day for the next week.
</p>
<p>
  Complice is sort of the opposite. 
It&#8217;s about making progress towards what you care about long-term by freely and improvisationally doing whatever makes sense today.
</p>
<p>
  So while the commitment device makes Complice
  <em>
    look
  </em>
  more like a Beeminder competitor, there&#8217;s almost never a situation in which you&#8217;d be choosing between the two.
</p>
<p>
  They have the &#8220;pay money if you don&#8217;t do it&#8221; in common, but it&#8217;s like comparing a bike and a plane as modes of transportation; for any given trip you want to make, you almost certainly are not actually going to feel like you have a serious choice between the two.
</p>
<p>
  You might think (Danny did initially) that this use of Complice or TaskRatchet displaces
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/mustdo\\"
    title=\\"Old Beeminder blog post about beeminding the one must-do task each day\\"
  >
    beeminded must-do goals
  </a>
  but I claim it doesn&#8217;t, since Complice doesn&#8217;t have a way to force you to
  <em>
    set
  </em>
  such a must-do!
</p>
<p>
  It has no ongoing monetary commitment, just one-offs, and always within 48 hours (usually much less) &#8212; which is in keeping with Complice&#8217;s anti-staleness philosophy. 
There&#8217;s no &#8220;I&#8217;ve gotta do this but I&#8217;ll set the deadline in the future so it feels less scary now but freaks me out then&#8221;. 
Instead it&#8217;s purely for that last minute push to say &#8220;no really,
  <em>
    today&#8217;s the day!
  </em>
  &#8221;

  Earlier this year we completed a lovely Beeminder book club to read behavioral scientist Katy Milkman&#8217;s new book,

    title=\\"Like Beeminder, this book has an insect as a mascot. Confession: I read the whole book before I noticed why that makes sense. PS: Wait, no, that wasn&#39;t my fault.

  .
The discussion all happened in the amazing
  <a
    href=\\"https://forum.beeminder.com\\"
    title=\\"Powered by Discourse.org\\"
  >
    Beeminder forum
  </a>
  but as a private group of 18 of us, so we could trash talk the book guilt-free (or just to be able to talk more freely about our own changing, I suppose).
Of course the cost of entry in the book club was to beemind reading the book.
We made a little

  if you&#8217;re curious.
</p>
<p>
  In case you&#8217;re not sure yet how much you care about this, I&#8217;ll start with an overly brief summary of each chapter:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Fresh starts, as in temporal landmarks, are powerful.
  </li>
  <li>
    Temptation bundling is a clever and useful lifehack.
  </li>
  <li>
    Commitment devices are the best of all, especially monetary commitment devices, though sadly, for Beeminder in particular, most people are not sophisticated enough to use them. 
(You&#8217;re rolling your eyes at me but I&#8217;m pretty sure this is a fair characterization of Milkman&#8217;s chapter on commitment devices!)
  </li>
  <li>
    Trigger-Action Plans!
  </li>
  <li>
    Nudging and defaults and the power of tracking.
  </li>
  <li>
    Believe in yourself or whatever (there are some actual useful things in this chapter too).
  </li>
  <li>
    Conformity and social pressure are influential. Everyone knows this.
  </li>
  <li>
    Akrasia is like diabetes &#8212; you don&#8217;t take insulin for a month and assume you&#8217;re cured. You&#8217;ve got to apply and maintain these systems and tools your whole life.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  My consternation at how little Milkman talks about Beeminder in the book was abated by the fact that it&#8217;s practically a Beeminder paean.
Or, another way to say that is Milkman is at the cutting edge of the science of behavior change, and so are we, and we&#8217;ve done our best to incorporate it into Beeminder.
So when Milkman describes the practical lessons from all that science, she&#8217;s kind of describing Beeminder.
Which makes this an easy book for us to review.
But there are plenty of Beeminder-orthogonal ideas in the book which I&#8217;ll get to as well.
</p>
<p>
  Let&#8217;s dive in.
</p>
<p>
  Milkman sets the stage in the introduction with a fun anecdote about Andre Agassi&#8217;s tennis renaissance (tennaissance?).
The lesson is that it takes a whole bag of very personalized tricks to effect personal change.
She comes back to this in the final chapter.
</p>
<h3>
  Chapter 1 on the power of Fresh Starts
</h3>
<p>
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/schelling/\\"
    title=\\"Schelling Fences on Slipper Slopes, by Scott Alexander\\"

    Temporal landmarks
  </a>
  like round dates or momentous/memorable life transitions are good excuses to initiate life changes and they offer at least some modicum of motivation. 
This is the Fresh Start Effect. 
Also there are more such temporal landmarks than you&#8217;d think (every Monday can count as one). 
Getting vaccinated felt like a pretty good one when our book club was happening.
And now New Year&#8217;s is around the corner.
</p>
<p>
  Of course Beeminder lets you turn on the Fresh Start Effect like a faucet.
Just create a graph!
(Having trouble getting yourself to do that? 
Like you need a meta-Beeminder to get you to use Beeminder?

  >
    have a tip
  </a>
  for that.)
</p>
<p>
  Continuing the theme of the book being a Beeminder infomercial in disguise, Milkman also talks about how fresh starts can be poison.
If you&#8217;ve built up a good habit, it can fall apart after a vacation.
This is why you schedule breaks in your Beeminder goals and don&#8217;t just
  <a

    title=\\"Make A Plan To Forget\\"
  >
    try to remember
  </a>
  to resume your routine when you get back.
</p>
<p>
  My biggest beef with this chapter is just that it fails to use Milkman and her students&#8217; original term, &#8220;temporal landmarks&#8221;.
She has at least
  <a
    href=\\"https://faculty.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/2015_PsychSci.pdf\\"
    title=\\"Put Your Imperfections Behind You: Temporal Landmarks Spur Goal Initiation When They Signal New Beginnings (2015)\\"
  >
    one paper
  </a>
  about this in which she uses the term &#8220;temporal landmark&#8221; 40 times and &#8220;fresh start&#8221; zero times.
I guess she changed her mind on the best term to use.
We shall allow it.
</p>
<h3>
  Chapter 2 on present bias and temptation bundling
</h3>
<p>
  Here&#8217;s a bit of
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/incentalign\\"
    title=\\"This is our generalization of commitment devices\\"
  >
    incentive alignment
  </a>
  wisdom from Mary Poppins and her spoonful of sugar:
Make things you
  <em>
    need
  </em>
  to do be things you also
  <em>
    want
  </em>
  to do, in the moment.
Milkman makes this concrete with some nice examples of what I consider her biggest claim to fame, temptation bundling:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Get a page-turner of an audiobook that you can only listen to while at the gym
  </li>
  <li>
    Get a pedicure while reading a boring work document
  </li>
  <li>
    Watch a particular Netflix show only while doing housework
  </li>
  <li>
    Eat at your favorite burger place only while mentoring a problem student (probably she can&#8217;t use this one anymore now that she used the example in a best-selling book?)
  </li>
  <li>
    Only drink wine while cooking meals
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  She rounds out the chapter with some discussion of symbolic awards and praise being motivating, and how gamification backfires if you&#8217;re not bought into it.
Fair enough.
</p>
<h3>
  Chapter 3 on commitment devices
</h3>
<p>
  It would be weird if this chapter didn&#8217;t mention Beeminder, and it does, barely.
(Mostly the book mentions
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.stickk.com/\\"
    title=\\"Take a contract out on yourself. (StickK may be too timid to still use this tagline but we still love it.)\\"
  >
    StickK
  </a>
  , since Milkman is friends with the founders of StickK.
Fair enough again.)
But of course this chapter is just all about why things like Beeminder are the unchallenged king of behavior change.
Which is nothing new for this audience.
Our favorite part of this chapter is the story of
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/nick/\\"
    title=\\"Nick&#39;s classic guest post on the Beeminder blog: Spiraling Into Control\\"
  >
    Nick Winter
  </a>
  and his banana-pants collection of commitment devices that he details in
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.nickwinter.net/the-motivation-hacker\\"
    title=\\"This book of course features Beeminder heavily, though Beeminder was quite new at the time\\"
  >
    The Motivation Hacker
  </a>
  .
</p>
<p>
  Milkman goes on to talk about softer commitment devices like
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/zipit\\"
    title=\\"Social Reality And The Canard About Keeping Your Goals To Yourself\\"
  >
    public pledges
  </a>
  : they&#8217;re better than nothing but don&#8217;t hold a candle to cash commitment contracts.
</p>
<p>
  She emphasizes the value of smaller and more frequent commitments.
This is Beeminder&#8217;s whole schtick, turning a long-term commitment into a continual, daily commitment.
</p>
<p>
  The tragic conclusion of this chapter is that, as far as commitment devices go, the world is divided into sophisticates and naifs.
Most people are the latter and are just not cut out for Beeminder.
We made this point in 
&#8220;

<h3>
  Chapter 4 on forgetfulness and cues
</h3>
<p>
  This chapter mostly talks about trigger-action plans. 
I call them trigger-action plans (or TAPs) because that&#8217;s what people in the rationality community call them.
Milkman doesn&#8217;t use that term. 
She refers to cues rather than triggers. 
Same difference. 
Also these are called &#8220;implementation intentions&#8221; in the psychology literature but I think we can all agree that that&#8217;s a horrible name and move on.
</p>
<p>
  (Actually we&#8217;ve mentioned implementation intentions on the blog a couple times. 
Like Bee&#8217;s weight loss tip #3 in her

  </a>
  .)
</p>
<p>
  My 
[favorite trigger-action plan](
  <a href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/should/\\">
    https://blog.beeminder.com/should/
  </a>
  &#8221;
  &#8220;I Resolve Not To Resolve; Or, The Anti-Resolution Resolution&#8221;
) &#8212; serving me very well for over 6 years and counting &#8212; is the following:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    <strong>
      IF
    </strong>
    I hear myself saying &#8220;I/we should do X&#8221;
    <strong>
      THEN
    </strong>
    I take some immediate action that gets me slightly closer to X happening.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  At our house, especially with our kids, we&#8217;ve been getting more and more mileage out of a meta-TAP,
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/forget\\"
    title=\\"Yes, we linked to this above already, for the phrase &#39;try to remember&#39; which is one of our triggers to employ this meta-TAP\\"
  >
    planning to forget
  </a>
  . 
When you catch yourself planning to remember to do something (pick something up after work, etc) or making a request prefaced with &#8220;remember to&#8221;, that&#8217;s your trigger to create a specific TAP that will prompt you to take a specific action at the specific time.
</p>
<p>
  Which is another point from this chapter: that timeliness is key.
Timely as in T minus seconds. 
If you remind someone about something that&#8217;s even minutes in the future, it flies right out of their head immediately.
</p>
<p>
  Another thing that helps is vivid, weird, or catchy cues.
Milkman also makes the point &#8212; another very Beeminder-y one &#8212; that making plans (trigger-action or otherwise) makes you get specific and break big goals down.
That alone is one of the most powerful change-achievers in the book, she says.
Finally, as any pilot will tell you, checklists are lifesavers.
</p>
<p>
  So I liked this chapter and I&#8217;d especially recommend it to anyone not already familiar with TAPs.

<h3>
  Chapter 5 on nudges and tracking
</h3>
<p>
  This chapter ends with something that might&#8217;ve made more sense in chapter 4, since it&#8217;s a nice corollary of the TAP concept.
Namely, chaining habits together. 
Piggybacking, Milkman calls it.
You can use an existing habit as the trigger for a new habit.
Maybe you&#8217;re trying to get yourself to floss regularly so you put the floss on top of your toothbrush in a way that you&#8217;re prompted to pick up the floss when you go to brush your teeth.
</p>
<p>
  The chapter begins with all the usual stuff about nudging and defaults. 
See our old post on
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/nudge/\\"
    title=\\"I feel slightly awkward using nudge terminology since our friend Jacob Falkovich of PutANumOnIt despises it passionately. And I think I agree with his points, just that we&#39;re talking about different aspects of it.\\"
  >
    Cranial Silicosis and Paths of Least Resistance
  </a>
  for how we learned some of this the hard way. 
As we say when discussing UI design, defaults are the most powerful force in the universe.
</p>
<p>
  Next comes elastic habits and the so-called limits of the power of routine.
There&#8217;s a story of Routine Rachel vs Flexible Fernando. 
I was unimpressed with all this.
Beeminder doesn&#8217;t need to care about your routines. 
You just commit to staying on track overall and then you can balance routine vs flexibility however you like. 
With the commitment in place, you don&#8217;t have to stress about those tradeoffs.
(Much) more on this in the next chapter.
</p>
<p>
  After that comes the so-called Seinfeld hack and the power of tracking. 
(Milkman loses points here for credulously repeating the myth that this has anything to do with Seinfeld.)
This is another case of being the babiest baby step towards Beeminder&#8217;s power. 
See our old
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/seinfeld/\\"
    title=\\"Aka Don&#39;t Break The Chain\\"
  >
    Seinfeld Hack
  </a>
  post. 
And tracking, I mean, look at us.
</p>
<p>
  My favorite bit in this chapter (already likely familiar to the uterus-having half of you) is the birth control pill placebo hack:
You don&#8217;t need to take the pills during the week of your period but you don&#8217;t want to get out of the habit of taking the daily pill so there&#8217;s just a week of placebos in there every month. 
(I hope mentioning this isn&#8217;t an infohazard!)
</p>
<p>
  Finally, there&#8217;s one thing in this chapter that I&#8217;m not sure I understand or appreciate.
Milkman emphasizes that you need to drill habits until they&#8217;re automatic, like a paramedic drilling a life-saving protocol.
Does she mean to literally schedule time to walk through the motions of habits you aim to cultivate?
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"DRILL1\\"
    href=\\"#DRILL\\"
  >
    [2]
  </a>
  She doesn&#8217;t give examples of actually doing this so I&#8217;m uncertain whether there&#8217;s a specific behavior change protocol here or if she&#8217;s just emphasizing that habits, both good and bad, can be, well, habituated.
This is pages 122-127 if anyone can better extract the wisdom here.
</p>
<h3>
  Chapter 6 on confidence and advice and believing
</h3>
<p>
  This was a very self-helpy chapter.
The first bit of ironic meta advice is that giving advice helps the advice-giver but backfires for the advice-receiver.
(This is related to something we&#8217;ve discovered with customer support.
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/upsidedown\\"
    title=\\"Upside-down support is what we call it when we turn a support request from a user upside-down and ask for the user’s help to improve the app or website the user needs support with.\\"
  >
    Upside-down support
  </a>
  , we call it.)
Taking that idea to its logical conclusion leads us to Advice Clubs.
Normally, unsolicited advice shakes a person&#8217;s confidence, but also giving someone else advice helps you by creating cognitive dissonance if you aren&#8217;t following your own advice.
An Advice Club gets the best of both worlds.
All the advice is solicited, by virtue of being given in Advice Club, and, most importantly, advice-givers are getting a commitment device.
You feel like a hypocrite if you don&#8217;t follow the advice you&#8217;re giving someone else.
</p>
<p>
  (Side tip that I picked up somewhere in the rationality community: 
Instead of offering advice to someone, pose an equivalent thought experiment. 
So instead of &#8220;you should do X&#8221; you can say &#8220;what do you think would happen if you did X?&#8221;)
</p>
<h4>
  Mulligans
</h4>
<p>
  So that was all pretty solid.
Also in this chapter is what psychologists call, with an apparently straight face, the what-the-hell effect.
Nothing earth-shattering here, just the observation that sometimes when you screw up with, say, your diet, you throw up your hands in dismay and upend your whole refrigerator directly into your gaping maw.
Milkman&#8217;s conclusion is that you should set ambitious goals but allow mulligans.
This is related to elastic habits, from chapter 5.
</p>
<p>
  I hated that in chapter 5 and I hate it here.
Mulligans are unbeemindery.
Or, rather, Beeminder has something better. 
In fact, multiple better ways of getting the advantages that Milkman claims mulligans have.
(There&#8217;s a study that Milkman&#8217;s mulligan claims are based on that we tore to shreds in the book club and which I&#8217;ll gloss over here. 
More about Milkman&#8217;s credulous citing of bad studies at the end.)
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    In Beeminder you can aim to stay in the green and eat into that safety buffer for emergencies.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can cap your pledge at something affordable and choose to pay for the derailment and subsequent respite sometimes.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can schedule breaks or shallow spots in your red line if you plan ahead a bit for times when you expect more disruption.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can even schedule a random flat spot for no reason other than to give yourself breathing room if you&#8217;ve been skating the edge.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Beeminder is all about flexibility.
</p>
<p>
  The idea of aiming to do something 7 days a week but excusing up to 2 days a week does seem psychologically powerful. 
But if you&#8217;re very akratic then it degenerates to just doing it 5 days a week and you might as well be clear that that&#8217;s the actual commitment.
</p>
<p>
  This is Beeminder&#8217;s

    title=\\"We didn&#39;t think to call it that back in 2013\\"
  >
    Anti-Leniency Principle
  </a>
  . 
Anything that makes your goal easier in the short-term backfires. 
Grace periods, mulligans, 3-strikes policies, the &#8220;wrong lane&#8221; of the old yellow brick road &#8212; it&#8217;s all a bad idea. 
If you want more leniency you should set your bright red line more conservatively &#8212; maybe with a
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/achilles/\\"
    title=\\"Beeminder’s Achilles Heel\\"
  >
    long initial flat spot
  </a>
  &#8212; but it is and must be bright. 
Things like mulligans fuzz it up. 
It amounts to trying to psychologically trick yourself into maintaining safety buffer by pretending the bright line is closer than it is. 
This works for a while and then eventually fails.
</p>
<p>
  What mulligans are really trying to accomplish is to specify two rates:
  <em>
    This
  </em>
  is how much I ideally want to do and
  <em>
    this
  </em>
  is the bare minimum.
Beeminder focuses on the bare minimum and doesn&#8217;t give you much guidance on how you&#8217;re doing with respect to your aspirational rate.
A workaround is to have two Beeminder goals:
one for the ambitious rate with a low pledge cap and one for the bare minimum with a high pledge cap.
</p>
<p>
  And Beeminder may streamline that in the future.
But I think part of the appeal of mulligans is similar to the appeal of setting your watch 5 minutes fast.
It&#8217;s a psychological trick you&#8217;re trying to play on yourself, hoping that your future self won&#8217;t wise up to it.
Beeminder refuses to play such tricks.
It&#8217;s all about an unambiguous bright red line.
</p>
<h4>
  Deep in self-help land
</h4>
<p>
  I mentioned this was a self-helpy chapter. 
There&#8217;s a fair bit of woo in it.
Self-affirmation, etc.
I&#8217;m clearly the wrong person to review anything like that, so if you like such things, assume I&#8217;m skipping over some good stuff here.
But it did lead to one insight that I appreciated:
Overconfidence is a huge cognitive bias but that&#8217;s because it&#8217;s so vital to ambition and getting things accomplished. 
Underconfidence is disastrous for agency and has no upsides. 
So you want to fight underconfidence and err on the side of overconfidence.
</p>
<p>
  Oh yes, and growth mindset, which

</p>
<h4>
  Housekeepers and magic milkshakes
</h4>
<p>
  Let&#8217;s move on to my least favorite part of the whole book, starting with a study on hotel housekeepers who magically lose weight by believing that their jobs count as exercise.
Or an even more implausible study claiming that if you believe your milkshake is low-calorie, your body produces different gut peptides or something.
Milkman cites all of this completely non-sarcastically.
It&#8217;s pretty bad.
There&#8217;s no way this stuff replicates, right?

Generously paraphrasing her:

  Chapter 8 on sustaining change
</h3>
<p>
  I already led with the main message of this chapter and the diabetes analogy.
There&#8217;s not much more to say.
Akrasia is a chronic condition!
Even after ingraining something for years, when you take away the treatment, the effect decays pretty fast, says Milkman.
So don&#8217;t do that.
</p>
<p>
  That&#8217;s why most Beeminder goals are open-ended.
Really

  But does it replicate?
</h3>
<p>
  I mentioned that my least favorite part of the book was Milkman&#8217;s citing of what seem to me like horrible studies.
More generally, I&#8217;m disappointed by her lack of appreciation of the
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/ego/\\"
    title=\\"A Beeminder blog post about a particularly Beeminder-relevant bit of the replication crisis\\"
  >
    replication crisis
  </a>
  . 
She acknowledges it when asked but makes zero mention of it in her whole book, citing probably hundreds of social science papers. 
I checked and there&#8217;s only one instance of the words &#8220;replicate&#8221; or &#8220;reproduce&#8221; in the book: 
mentioning that a study from the 1800s has been replicated. 
That&#8217;s kind of worse than never mentioning replicability. 
It implies that you need to mention that a study from the 1800s replicates but you don&#8217;t need to mention it for more modern studies. 
Someone who didn&#8217;t know would assume that that means that modern studies generally replicate!
It feels almost dishonest to blithely cite all these studies to back up your claims, knowing that the ones that haven&#8217;t replicated are maybe literally more likely than not to be bogus.
</p>
<p>
  Here&#8217;s a trimmed transcript of Milkman responding to a question about the replication crisis
  <a

<blockquote>
  <p>
    I didn&#8217;t put in any studies that I believe are unreliable into my book and in fact, took some out as I learned things that made me question them. So, I tried to be pretty careful &#8212; which doesn&#8217;t mean that it&#8217;s all perfect. But, that was really important to me.
    <br>
    &nbsp;
    <br>
    I will say, I&#8217;ve sort of been at the center in some ways of watching the replication crisis unfold. 
I&#8217;m in a department at Wharton with 
[Simmons and Simonsohn, studying p-hacking, etc].
 
I think it&#8217;s so important &#8212; I&#8217;m so glad that we&#8217;re getting things cleaned up. I guess I will say, I think there are plenty of things that aren&#8217;t true. But, there&#8217;s also lots of things that do replicate and are really robust.
    <br>
    &nbsp;
    <br>
    For instance, present bias. That replicates. Commitment devices are valuable. That replicates. And, it&#8217;s not shocking that some of the things replicate that do. Because, honestly my sense is a lot of the things that don&#8217;t replicate are the things that looked like magic in the first place. So, when you constrain yourself, when you incentivize yourself to be differently, better things happen.
    <br>
    &nbsp;
    <br>
    So, I tried really hard when writing the book to stay away from anything that felt or smelled like magic. 
I&#8217;m sure there will be something in the book that doesn&#8217;t replicate because almost certainly there&#8217;s always something. 
There are a lot of studies in there. 
I think about a seventh of the pages are my reference section. 
But, I stand by it.
In general the themes are so robust and the things I focus on &#8212; many, many, many studies have shown them to be true. 
So, hopefully there&#8217;s not much in there that people should be worried about.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  I think she&#8217;s absolutely sincere there but she&#8217;s ultimately saying that unless an unreplicated study smelled fishy to her, she assumed it was legit.
That&#8217;s insufficiently appreciative of the breadth and depth of the crisis.
</p>
<p>
  Even though Milkman believes in everything she cites (except maybe the magic weight loss stuff in chapter 6?), I think intellectual honesty should require more explicit asterisks when making claims based on social science studies that haven&#8217;t yet been replicated. 
It&#8217;s not enough to filter out studies that have failed replication.
</p>
<p>
  (But it&#8217;s nice how the one thing she points out definitely does replicate is the most Beemindery stuff &#8212; present bias aka akrasia and commitment devices!)
</p>
<p>
  <br>
  &nbsp;
  <br>
</p>
<p>
  Ok, requisite replication rant written.
I&#8217;m still an academic at heart so I was compelled to say all that but most of you are reading this for perfectly pragmatic reasons.
Like strategies for, I don&#8217;t know, how to change?
Even if we wanted to be maximally cynical and assume that every study we don&#8217;t know replicates doesn&#8217;t replicate &#8212; as I largely did in the bulk of this review &#8212; the book is still full of important insights.
For those already deep in the Beeminder community there won&#8217;t be too many surprises.
But for everyone else, Milkman delivers.

then the posterior probability is far above 50%.

  There&#8217;s also a good chance you can successfully use Beeminder if you&#8217;re reading this footnote but mostly think of shampoo and butts when we say things like &#8220;conditioning&#8221; and &#8220;posteriors&#8221;.

  I&#8217;ve had a Beeminder account since 2012, and in that time I&#8217;ve used it for everything from practicing Baroque recorder to learning Cued Speech to finally passing a 260 WPM stenography test on the fourth try. 
When I&#8217;m trying for a particularly high stakes goal, I find the escalating pledge system invaluable; even though my steno test goal got up to $90 at one point, passing it kept me from spending another $160 in registration fees, so it was definitely worthwhile from a financial perspective.
These days, though, my life is in more of a maintenance phase. 
My wife and I are currently trying for a kid, I&#8217;m trying to move more of my business online so that I can work mostly from home, and all in all, we&#8217;re both sort of treading water while waiting for the next big thing to come along. 
I don&#8217;t need the knuckle-biting stress of waking up in the red every day; making sure my good habits don&#8217;t atrophy is enough for me right now. 
To that end, I&#8217;ve narrowed down my goals so that they fit into three major categories: 
Staying healthy, keeping up my household, and looking after my business.
</p>
<p>
  Most of my work this summer has involved hanging out at my desk on standby, waiting for a client to text me. 
I keep my cell phone in a little dock with its screen perpetually on, and this is what sits in my peripheral vision throughout the workday:
</p>

</p>
<p>
  See those nine squares up in the left hand corner? 
Those are my nine active Beeminder goals, and for the first time ever, I&#8217;ve managed to keep them in the green for more than a few days in a row. 
Nine is the perfect number for me. 
It&#8217;s symmetrical, it&#8217;s compact, I can take it in at a glance, and most importantly, whenever any one of those nine squares is out of the green, it drives me absolutely bananas. 
None of these goals is high stakes enough to have a top dollar pledge. 
They&#8217;re all about the long term. 
So color has become a bigger motivator for me than money. 
I love green, like blue, hate orange, and despise red. 
Before I had the widget grid on my phone, I let most of my goals drift into the blue or orange as a matter of course, because I didn&#8217;t usually look at my Beeminder dash unless I was on an emergency day. 
Now, though, it&#8217;s the first thing I see when I get up in the morning, and waking up in the red is enough to throw off my whole day, so I&#8217;m forced to plan ahead and stay far more disciplined than before.
</p>
<p>
  These are my current goals:
</p>
<h3>
  Business
</h3>
<p>
  Reply Zero
: Answer all emails tagged with a @reply label. 
Beeminder has cured me of Inbox Sprawl by training me to achieve Inbox Zero several times a day, so my only remaining challenge is to reply to everything requiring an answer in a timely manner.

    You Need A Budget

This is a reverse odometer custom goal that keeps me under a set amount spent on groceries + restaurants + delivery.
</p>
<p>
  Cheaper Groceries
: I love expensive grocery stores. It&#8217;s a terrible habit. 
This goal gives me a point whenever I go to an affordable grocery store, and takes away a point whenever I go to one of the absurdly pricey fancypants stores that abound in New York City.

Every night I press the little moon widget to start sleep tracking, and every morning when I turn my alarm off, my sleep duration gets sent to Beeminder. 
I&#8217;ve been getting to bed way earlier and sleeping way more since I started tracking it!
</p>
<p>
  There are no words to describe how happy it makes me to see those nine green squares every day, and how annoyed with myself I get when one or more of them is another color. 
Even though the difficulty is cranked pretty far down right now, it&#8217;s been having a considerable influence on my life. 
I&#8217;ve found myself eating fewer cookies, bringing lunch to work, tidying up barely messy rooms, and dragging myself off the couch just so I can keep all my greens for another day. 
Someday soon I&#8217;ll crank up the difficulty on my goals a bit, or add another goal that I need to start pledging big money on, but for now I&#8217;m just exulting in the green.

<h3>
  Beeminder Reprise
</h3>
<p>
  What&#8217;s special about Beeminder is that we combine Quantified Self &#8212; i.e., self-tracking, data collection, and visualization &#8212; with commitment contracts.
So in addition to reminders to move, we add graphs of your cumulative progress and a penalty if you don&#8217;t keep up.
You can adjust how hard your goals are along the way, but if you ever fall behind we charge you.
Long-time Beeminder users find that those stings are well worth it for all the awesomeness we induce the rest of the time.
But if the thought of having to pay money is too scary, that&#8217;s perfect: you&#8217;ll be very motivated to get out and get moving.
</p>
<h3>
  Misfit
</h3>
<p>
  If you&#8217;re into Quantified Self but don&#8217;t identify as a nerd, you&#8217;re probably super excited by Misfit.
They make what is probably the only activity and sleep tracker that anyone&#8217;s ever refered to as &#8220;stylish&#8221; or &#8220;elegant&#8221;.
I admit to thinking that is a pretty big deal.
We&#8217;re impressed with the clever design that allows you to swap the tracker into different housings, so you can clip it to your bra, wear it as a modern-looking watch, pop it into a necklace pendant that makes it look like a flower, or even wear it on a piece of scrap yarn around your neck! (That&#8217;s how our CEO wears his.)
It is small and attractive, and thanks to the design you can wear it to any event.
</p>
<p>
  Even better than looking pretty, it&#8217;s also waterproof and uses a watch battery, with an expected life of about 6 months. 
You never have to charge it. 
In fact you could literally never take this off (and we don&#8217;t).
And sleep is auto-detected.
Talk about low friction.
</p>
<h3>
  Getting Started
</h3>
<p>
  Here&#8217;s how it works using your Misfit with Beeminder.
</p>
<p>
  It&#8217;s really pretty easy. 
Once you authorize us to read your data from Misfit, Beeminder will automatically pull in all of your new Misfit data.
All you have to do is keep syncing your Misfit per usual &#8212; there are no hoops Beeminder makes you jump through other than perhaps literally, if that&#8217;s your method of choice for upping your step count.
We&#8217;ll send you reminders if you&#8217;re approaching the edge of your road, meaning if you haven&#8217;t been doing enough you&#8217;ll get notified.
Misfit does a nice job of telling you how you&#8217;ve done today compared to yesterday, and our graphs show you the bigger picture of how you&#8217;ve done overall. 
Maybe yesterday you hardly got out of your chair, but that&#8217;s just one day! 
Beeminder will make sure that you stick to the goal you set in the long run.
And if you do fall behind, we&#8217;ll charge you money (or ask you to add a credit card so that we can charge you next time).

<h2>
  Non-Nerd Version of This Harrowing Tale
</h2>
<p>
  Bethany and I woke up at 7am on March 7th to a text message from
  <a href=\\"http://beeminder.com/aboutus\\">
    Jill
  </a>
  that some graphs seemed to be fubar.
Panic ensued as we hacked away nonstop till 5pm or so, never getting dressed or leaving the house.
What was the problem?
The night before we had run a seemingly innocuous command to destroy some data points that were part of
  <a href=\\"http://beeminder.com/meta/users\\">
    meta/users
  </a>
  in such-and-such time range.
I think we were cleaning up test users so as not to inadvertantly inflate that metric.
</p>
<p>
  We used a command called &#8220;destroy_all&#8221; on the dataset we wanted to get rid of, but it turns out destroy_all can&#8217;t be qualified that way and, much worse, it silently ignores the error.
When we ran that command it just started destroying all the data points!
We canceled the command when it seemed to be taking too long, not suspecting how drastically awry things had just gone.
Until the fateful text from Jill, which triggered a frantic scramble to piece everything back together from the last backup and the logs of new data that came in since then.
</p>
<p>
  Long story short: Bethany saves the day and all is well again in Beeminder land.
</p>
<h2>
  Nerd Version
</h2>
<p>
  We hate to pile on poor Mongo but the recent
  <a href=\\"http://blog.serverdensity.com/does-everyone-hate-mongodb/\\">
    spate of Hacker News hate for Mongo
  </a>
  reminded us that we should really blog about a little experience we had six months ago.
</p>
<p>
  So here&#8217;s what not to do!
</p>
<p>
  First, fire up the Rails console on your production machine and write a little query to find the objects you want:
</p>
<pre>
  Datapoints.where(:conditions=&gt;blahblah)
</pre>
<p>
  Inspect your results. 
Confirm that is totally the set of objects you want to blow to smithereens. 
&#8220;Yes, yes it is. 
I feel totally confident (well, maybe slightly anxious, let&#8217;s be honest now) in blowing away that results set.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
  Then:
</p>
<pre>
  Datapoints.where(:conditions=&gt;blahblah).destroy_all
</pre>
<p>
  Our datapoints query was scoped within the domain of a single Goal instance (some meta goal), and it still went through destroying ALL the datapoints. 
Fuck scope.
</p>
<p>
  If you have a lot of Things, (and we do &#8212; going on half a million of them now), it turns out this will take for frakkin&#8217; ever, because it is DESTROYING EVERYTHING. 
If you wait for it to actually return, you get a handy error along the lines of 
&#8220;Can&#8217;t do destroy on a query object. (But I just destroyed everything anyway. Y&#8217;know, just in case.)&#8221;
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"ERR1\\"
    href=\\"#ERR\\"
  >
    [1]
  </a>
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;Calling destroy_all illegally on a query object destroys the entire collection!&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  First off, above is just not how destroy_all is supposed to work. RTFM, etc.
The destroy_all method is a ClassMethod that actually takes the query conditions as arguments, performs the query for you, and destroys each document returned.
So calling destroy_all on a collection with no arguments in fact destroys everything.
Where we went wrong was assuming that the scope of the previously chained query would apply. 
The problem with this may stem from the where() method actually returning a Plucky::Query object, not a results set from the database. 
This is for some very nice reasons, like being able to chain together queries, and not actually hitting the database until you need the results, etc. 
Still, it&#8217;s pretty crazy that the result of calling destroy_all illegally on a query object is to destroy the entire collection!
</p>
<p>
  Anyway, we didn&#8217;t wait for that point, so we never got that helpful error. 
We noticed that it was taking too long so we just killed it. 
Nothing was obviously amiss yet and we fell asleep, blissfully unaware of the chaos we would soon wake up to.
</p>
<h2>
  Lessons
</h2>
<p>
  Holy cow is Bethany an amazing hacker. 
She sprang to action, fingers flying, writing Ruby code from scratch to parse and piece together everything from our transaction logs and merge it with our last uncorrupted backup from the day before.
I fell in love all over again.
</p>
<p>
  <a href=\\"http://patrickrjordan.com/\\">
    Patrick Jordan
  </a>
  got the told-you-so award for the day:
Never run ad hoc commands in the production console!
I&#8217;ll claim 2nd prize for insisting on a solid, machine-parsable transaction log, which made it possible to piece everything back together.
But Bethany was still the hero of the day for doing the heavy lifting on the actual piecing together.
We won&#8217;t talk about whose fault the whole thing was in the first place (since the real answer is Fucking Mongo&#8217;s Fault!).
</p>
<p>
  Or maybe it&#8217;s Mongomapper&#8217;s fault.
We just
  <a href=\\"https://github.com/jnunemaker/mongomapper/issues/458\\">
    raised the issue there
  </a>
  in hopes of getting this fixed.
We&#8217;re embarrassed that we sat on this for so long after solving our own immediate problem.
We kept meaning to help get it fixed for posterity but failed to get a
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/tuit\\">
    round tuit
  </a>
  .
</p>
<p>
  UPDATE 2012.12.27: This was just fixed in the master branch of the
  <a href=\\"https://github.com/jnunemaker/mongomapper\\">
    MongoMapper repository on Github
  </a>
  . Phew!

  PS: Oh, Irony! 
While converting the above from a post-mortem email amongst ourselves into a blog post,
  <a href=\\"https://twitter.com/mietek\\">
    Miëtek Bak
  </a>
  kindly alerted us that when we
  <a href=\\"https://twitter.com/beemuvi/status/249182475601989632\\">
    deployed our shiny new goal creation wizard
  </a>
  we introduced a bug that set all new goals as temporary test goals, meaning they magically delete themselves after a number of days.
Oy. So we have another fun night of putting Humpty Dumpty back together again. And a bunch of apologetic emails to send.
Note that the Mongo thing happened six months ago so I guess we were overdue for another fit of ineptitude&#8230;

  about accidentally running a query that started deleting our whole database?
It&#8217;s pretty entertaining and helpfully demarcates the parts that non-nerds should skip.
If you&#8217;re a non-nerd I&#8217;d stick with (the non-nerd parts of) that post.
The executive summary of this post is that we upgraded back-end stuff and it caused everything to break and we didn&#8217;t sleep very much for 48 hours but now we think things are back to normal, sort of, but please tell us if not.
</p>

  OK nerds, backing up, Beeminder is a Ruby on

  app with Mongo as the database.
In between Rails and Mongo is the Object-Relational Mapper, or ORM.

  </a>
  It&#8217;s how Rails and Mongo talk to each other.
Back in 2011 there were two choices for this: MongoMapper and Mongoid.
MongoMapper was written by the obviously awesome John Nunemaker of GitHub so that&#8217;s what we went with.
Google searches are suggesting that that was even Mongo&#8217;s official endorsement at the time so I guess we don&#8217;t need to feel dumb about that choice.
Except for the part where, some months after we publicly launched, we found an outrageous bug that made MongoMapper try to delete our database (see aforementioned blog post from 2012) and that didn&#8217;t set off enough alarm bells to make us flee from it in terror.
</p>
<p>
  But whether or not we should&#8217;ve known better, we bet on the wrong horse.
MongoMapper went moribund over the last few years and, due to various dependencies with newer versions of other libraries we&#8217;re using, we were eventually forced to switch to Mongoid.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;Deploying this new model of modernity meant a mind-numbingly meticulous monster merge.&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  Back in October, Bethany embarked on the project of making that switch, along with other needed refactoring and upgrades of Ruby and Rails.
That was all in a separate branch of the code, of course, and the main branch of Beeminder wasn&#8217;t staying still.
So when the upgrades and ORM switch were ready, deploying this new model of modernity meant a mind-numbingly meticulous monster merge. 
Mmmm. 
I mean, gack. 
It was super hard and error-prone and there were many things related to autodata integrations that we didn&#8217;t have a good way to test outside of production.
</p>
<p>
  But finally we got impatient and bit the bullet and deployed the new hotness Monday night. 
And then everything broke.

  It was another 24 hours before we cleaned up the rest of the messes.
Frustratingly, the one issue we haven&#8217;t resolved yet is that the whole site seems to be slower now.
We may have messed up some database indices and are still profiling and investigating.
</p>
<p>
  For posterity, here&#8217;s the list of things that broke (and that we now believe to be fixed):
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    IFTTT triggers broke in a couple different ways
  </li>
  <li>
    The SMS bot and some emails started spewing broken html
  </li>
  <li>
    Several autodata integrations broke in various ways
  </li>
  <li>
    Every time a goal was saved we overwrote various settings, most noticeably the goal&#8217;s deadline (this involved painstakingly parsing our transaction log to reconstruct things and make sure no data was lost)
  </li>
  <li>
    UI icons disappeared briefly
  </li>
  <li>
    Everyone&#8217;s session expired which was especially bad because the password reset function was briefly broken (thanks to

    </a>
    for quickly solving that one)
  </li>
  <li>
    Signing in with Google broke (and led us on a wild goose chase and maybe was just a matter of Google needing confirmation of the change of IP address or something)
  </li>
  <li>
    Changing rate units silently failed
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Thanks so much for all the patience and encouragement! 
Keep telling us about problems you notice, even when you figure we probably already know. 
Getting multiple reports is a great gauge of priority.

  This was all written with not enough input from Bee, who&#8217;s still recovering from the trauma herein described.
Since this post is due at 6am (see that dogfood graph in the sidebar?) and she went to sleep shortly after midnight,
I asked her for her disutility for being woken up at 5am to vet this post before it went live.
She said she was too tired to introspect on her utility function properly but the bounds were $20 to $800 of disutility.
That&#8217;s pretty high (in expectation) so I&#8217;m going to publish this without her vetting and she can chime in in the comments if I got anything wrong!
</p>
<p>
  And huge thank you, Bee, for the hacking heroics!
Despite all these things breaking, and lots of people being sad, we avoided more than a few minutes of downtime and I believe most users didn&#8217;t actually notice any problems at all.
Which is pretty amazing.

for staying up half the night with us talking to distressed users and helping with triage.
Our Support Czar, Chelsea Miller, has been brilliant as ever in the aftermath as well.
It doesn&#8217;t hurt that our users apparently like us so much that they stay super nice even when we break everything.

<p>
  Our bodies and minds have evolved to enjoy life right here and now because it could be gone tomorrow.
We crave fatty foods because they gave us extra padding in case we couldn&#8217;t eat next week.
We crave sweets because they gave us energy to keep ourselves alive.
Then came all the conveniences of the modern world.
Sweets are no longer just healthy fruits but an endless bounty of candy, cakes, and ice cream.
Fatty foods are no longer hard to obtain. They&#8217;re right there at the local McDonald&#8217;s.
But our bodies and the primitive parts of our minds keep telling us that we need as much of these foods as we can possibly take in.
So we tend to over eat, without any of the physical work it used to take to acquire food.
The problem &#8212; for the lucky first-world readers of this blog &#8212; is how
  <em>
    not
  </em>
  to eat to excess, and how to induce ourselves to get physical exercise that is no longer a natural part of daily life.
</p>
<p>
  Traditionally, we never had to worry about things like retirement and cancer.
We were lucky if we lived to be 40.
But now, modern medicine and a shift to a very technical society means we need to think about our futures and how to get there.
You can think of yourself as actually two selves.
Your primitive monkey self wants what it needs to survive and it wants it right now.
It doesn&#8217;t care about tomorrow because there may not be one.
Your other self is your future self.
The concept of our future selves is a very abstract concept to our primitive monkey brains.
This future self sits back and reflects on all the things that have happened in your life.
Often it looks back with regret because your monkey self didn&#8217;t toe the line and ensure the happiness of your future self.
Your monkey self may be overweight, out of shape, and not accomplishing anything.
Your future self is healthy, fit, and successful.
At least that&#8217;s how your current self sees it.
But often your current self is unable to do the things necessary to create that future self.
It&#8217;s simply not how your still-primitive monkey brain is wired.
If you find the thought of your primitive mind insulting, think about life just 200 years ago.
It wasn&#8217;t much different than 2000 years ago, with the exception of agriculture.
People still had to do physical work to stay alive.
People didn&#8217;t have modern conveniences like Starbucks and McDonald&#8217;s.
If you wanted food, you worked for it.
If your clothing fell into disrepair, you fixed it.
If you needed to go somewhere, you walked or rode a horse.
 
We haven&#8217;t evolved much since the times of our great great grandparents.
But we are living much longer and have to be much more thoughtful.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;Habit is habit and not to be flung out of the window by any man, but coaxed downstairs a step at a time.&#8221;  
&#8212; Mark Twain
</h4>
<p>
  Over the years I have made many promises to myself.
I&#8217;ve promised myself I&#8217;d eat better, drink less beer, and get more exercise.
I&#8217;ve had mixed results with all of them.
As my future self comes to be, I find that ultimately nothing has changed.
Then I noticed an interesting disparity.
A few years ago I got a dog.
If my dog is neglected, he will suffer or die.
When I got him, I promised him I would always take care of him and think of his needs before anything else.
I have a serious obligation to my pet and he is completely dependent on me upholding that obligation.
Since I got my dog, he&#8217;s had healthy meals every day.
He&#8217;s gotten exercise and play time twice a day and has been taken somewhere special at least once a week.
I haven&#8217;t been nearly so thoughtful or loving with myself.
The difference is that I have a contract with my dog.
I don&#8217;t have a contract with my future self.
The problem is that my future self isn&#8217;t a present entity.
If I forget to feed my dog his tummy starts growling.
If I neglect to exercise him he can&#8217;t manage his energy levels.
However if I overfeed my self or fail to exercise my self, my future self suffers in silence.
It will be a miserable creature, and it&#8217;s no exaggeration to say that I&#8217;m risking an early death.
</p>
<p>
  We need to treat our future selves better.
We need to create contracts with our future selves so that we can both be happy.
One way of doing this is by setting goals.
A goal is a way of saying, this is who I want my future self to be.
The problem is that usually we leave it up to our future selves to figure out how to do it.
We procrastinate.
The future self is an abstract concept that the monkey self doesn&#8217;t understand or care about.
The modern human, however, has to be more evolved and overcome the akrasia created by our monkey selves.
</p>
<p>
  There are a number of tools out there to help us do better by our future selves.
Many of them fall into the category of
  <a href=\\"http://lifehacker.com/\\">
    lifehacking
  </a>
  .
Some of my personal favorites are
  <a href=\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done\\">
    GTD
  </a>
  and
  <a href=\\"http://zenhabits.net/ben-franklins-hack-tweaked-tracking-my/\\">
    Benjamin Franklin&#8217;s spreadsheet for changing habits
  </a>
  .
A great tool for Franklin&#8217;s habit system can be found at
  <a href=\\"http://www.joesgoals.com/\\">
    Joe&#8217;s Goals
  </a>
  .
</p>
<p>
  But there are some hugely important things missing from these tools:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Accountability, accountability, accountability.
  </li>
  <li>
    The ability to quantify results.
  </li>
  <li>
    The ability to create and maintain a contract with your future self.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  I&#8217;ve found all of these things in
  <a href=\\"http://beeminder.com\\">
    Beeminder
  </a>
  .
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;If you drop the ball, it&#8217;s no longer your future self who pays the price, it&#8217;s you.&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  Accountability is massive.
Your future self is, after all, in the future.
So right now there&#8217;s just you and your primitive monkey brain.
There&#8217;s nobody looking over your shoulder, waiting to throw a banana at you if you smoke another cigarette or eat another Twinkie.
Which is why having a financial incentive with Beeminder is so important.
With Beeminder, if you choose to stake a financial obligation on your goal, you&#8217;re being held accountable every day.
Failure is no longer the problem of your future self.
It&#8217;s your problem every day.
If you drop the ball, it&#8217;s no longer your future self who pays the price, it&#8217;s you.
You&#8217;re being held accountable.
</p>
<p>
  The ability to quantify results is one that I hadn&#8217;t even considered before Beeminder.
But it&#8217;s vastly important.
It&#8217;s easy enough to say I&#8217;m overweight or I&#8217;m not.
But what about all those months and years in between being successful and not successful where there are often intangible degrees?
It&#8217;s so easy to get lost and say I&#8217;m a failure because I haven&#8217;t succeeded yet.
Hence the yellow brick road.
Every day that you stay on it (or on the good side of it) you can say you are successful even if your goal has not yet been fully realized.
</p>
<p>
  And then there&#8217;s the contract.
The contract is in the graph itself.
Your monkey self and your future self can both look at it and tell whether you&#8217;ve been loyal to the program.
Adding a financial incentive seals the deal.
If you fail, both your current and your future self lose out.
But if you stay on your yellow brick road, both selves win.

  Which motivational archetype do you most identify with:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Philosopher &#8212; better understand the universe, live the life of the mind
  </li>
  <li>
    Hedonist &#8212; go on adventures, have wild romances
  </li>
  <li>
    Caregiver &#8212; have meaningful relationships, raise children
  </li>
  <li>
    Creator &#8212; make beautiful things, make enduring things
  </li>
  <li>
    Politician &#8212; lead and influence people, improve the world
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  I would call myself a Philosopher, then Creator/Politician, followed by Hedonist/Caregiver, but I aspire to exhibit all five.
</p>
<p>
  I came up with these archetypes from conversations with
  <a

    title=\\"Mostly Greek to me despite being translated to English\\"

  about what we wanted to do for the next few decades, I tried to reconstruct the archetypes from memory and ended up adding Caregivers and Creators.
</p>
<p>
  It then occurred to me that my archetypes are a bit similar to the Hogwarts Houses in

  :

  </li>
  <li>
    Hufflepuffs are Caregiver Creators
  </li>
  <li>
    Slytherins are straight-up Politicians
  </li>
</ul>

  I posed this on Facebook and to fellow worker bees, Cosmo Quiz style, and have compiled the results in a forum post along with a poll for you all:

  </a>
</center>
<p>
  What&#8217;s the point of all this?
Well, Beeminder is all about setting goals and striving toward your ideal self.
Mostly Beeminder tends to be used to keep your Hedonist side from crowding out other specific goals, though there are plenty of pro-Hedonist goals too.
But my hope is that we can use these archetypes for more principled goal setting.
Like by making sure you have at least one goal in each category or focusing on the archetypes you tend to neglect.

This comes up in the context of weight loss goals.
It can be very frustrating to have a datapoint off the yellow brick road due to a random daily fluctuation.
Fitness trainers often recommend weekly weigh-ins because daily random weight fluctuations freak people out. 
But of course the answer to that is not less data but data smoothing.

  :
an exponentially weighted moving average.
So, you ask, why not beemind that instead of the raw datapoints?
Could that avoid the heartache of beeminding such a noisy metric as daily weight?
</p>
<p>
  Ok, enough faux questions.
Here&#8217;s why it doesn&#8217;t work, despite the moving average being the right thing to look at to see the trend.
</p>
<p>
  Imagine your road is sloping down and you&#8217;re below it at first but you weigh in every day at the same weight, 100kg. 
You&#8217;re on a collision course with the road. 
After multiple days of 100kg each day, you find yourself on the wrong side of the road. 
It&#8217;s an emergency day and you need to lose a fraction of a kilogram to get back on. 
Except you&#8217;re beeminding the moving average so now you need to lose many times that to actually bring the
  <em>
    average
  </em>
  down enough. 
You&#8217;re actually requiring a bunch more foresight to keep from derailing &#8212; a much worse problem than the fluctuations!
</p>
<p>

    class=\\"aligncenter\\"

  >
</p>
<center>
  <i>
    In this example, you weigh in at 100kg every day until the eep day.
Beeminding the raw datapoints you&#8217;d need to lose less than 0.1kg.
Beeminding the moving average you&#8217;d need to lose a full kilogram.

  </a>
  and beeminding the moving average still means that you&#8217;re skating the edge and every day there&#8217;s some magic weight that you must weigh in at to keep from derailing.
That&#8217;s fundamental to beeminding weight. 
No matter how you try to smooth the data or widen the road, if you eked by yesterday then there will necessarily be a magic weight that you absolutely must hit today to stay on track. 
It&#8217;s like a no-free-lunch theorem,

Whatever we do ends up equivalent to having a single bright line that your (actual) weight is not allowed to cross every day.
</p>
<h2>
  But The Hacker&#8217;s Diet says&#8230;
</h2>
<p>
  Yes, and our moving average line is exactly as the good book recommends. 
The Hacker&#8217;s Diet then suggests that, when in intense weight loss mode, you make sure all your datapoints are below the moving average. 
That&#8217;s not too different from Beeminder&#8217;s insistence that all the datapoints be on the Yellow Brick Road.
</p>
<p>
  More and more I&#8217;m convinced that the more fundamental solution to this kind of problem is to

That is, we recommend beeminding things under your direct control, like calories, steps, miles, minutes of exercise.

  >
    my datapoints
  </a>
  you can see the variety of actions I&#8217;ve been using it for.
</p>
<p>
  To set up your own Must-Do goal, select Beeminder&#8217;s standard &#8220;Do More&#8221; goal. 
I unticked the &#8220;Start on a flat road&#8221; option because I wanted to be forced to get moving on my tasks straight away.
If you&#8217;re new to Beeminder or don&#8217;t want the immediate pressure, then beginning with a flat road is probably a good idea.
[UPDATE 2020: Starting right away is the default now; we make it obvious how to start with initial safety buffer if you don&#8217;t want the immediate pressure but mostly people do and it&#8217;s a bit more natural that way.]
That gives you a gentle, forgiving start on the road towards awesome anti-procrastination-ness. 
Whenever you&#8217;re ready for pressure, dial in a weekly rate of 7.
This will encourage you to do a Must-Do task every day.
</p>
<p>
  For each day, you&#8217;ll be choosing a task to accomplish &#8212; something you otherwise would probably not have done on that day but something you&#8217;d really like to get done. 
At the end of the day, if you did that task, you enter &#8220;1&#8221; as your datapoint. 
If you didn&#8217;t do the task, you enter &#8220;0&#8221; &#8212; and perhaps fall off the yellow brick road!
</p>
<p>
  When you enter your datapoint, use the comment to specify what your task will be for the
  <em>
    next
  </em>
  day. 
This keeps the momentum going, encourages you to think each night about what you&#8217;d really like to achieve on the next day, and records your commitment in writing.
All of these things help in the fight against procrastination.
</p>
<p>
  When I&#8217;m entering my comment, I like to use wording such as &#8220;On Monday I will clean the bath&#8221; (where Monday is the next day). 
Specifying the precise day and using a positive phrase like &#8220;I will&#8221; helps to focus my mind on the fact that this task IS something that WILL be done and the day on which it WILL be done is MONDAY. 
It leaves me with no wriggle room!
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;Sometimes I use my Must-Do goal to force myself to do easy, five-minute tasks that for some bizarre reason I have been avoiding.&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  The kinds of tasks you choose for your Must-Do goal are really up to you.
Select anything that you&#8217;ve been putting off no matter how minor or silly. 
Sometimes I use my Must-Do goal to force myself to do easy, five-minute tasks that for some bizarre reason I have been avoiding. 
Just don&#8217;t pick something too difficult or too time-consuming to be easily finished in one day (along with all the other stuff you have to fit into that day!). 
If there is something big that you really need prodding for, just enter one small step.
Instead of &#8220;On Monday I will write the TPS report&#8221; try &#8220;On Monday I will start the TPS report&#8221; or &#8220;On Monday I will write one page of the TPS report&#8221;. 
Scary monster tasks become much more manageable when you chop bits off them.
</p>
<p>
  But of course if you
  <em>
    want
  </em>
  to tackle monsters head-on, you can always chain a few tasks together:
&#8220;On Monday I will wash the sheets AND disinfect the floors AND toilet-train the dog.&#8221;
If you&#8217;re feeling up to it, be ambitious and indomitable!
</p>
<p>
  A Must-Do goal can be a useful adjunct to a normal task management system. 
I usually use Mark Forster&#8217;s

and they&#8217;re very good at helping to overcome procrastination, but even they can&#8217;t always get me moving on actions that I&#8217;m stubbornly avoiding.
The commitment of a
  <a href=\\"http://beeminder.com/money\\">
    Beeminder pledge
  </a>
  gives me the extra impetus I need.
And on days when I have so little discretionary time that I don&#8217;t get around to opening my todo list, my Must-Do goal ensures that I do achieve at least one thing of importance to me!
</p>
<p>
  You can also use a Must-Do goal to achieve a helpful state of mind during stressful times.
If you know that tomorrow will be especially difficult, perhaps from extra duties in your job or a big family gathering, then spend a bit of time the night before thinking about what you&#8217;ll need to do or how you&#8217;ll need to feel to get through the day, and base your comment around that.
&#8220;On Monday I will remain calm and will ask for help when I need it. With patience and careful work I can stay in control and fulfill my duties.&#8221;
Throughout the day, leave a browser window open showing your pretty Beeminder graph with your string of successes so far and let it be a reminder of how much you can achieve with just a little a bit of dedication.
When evening comes and you need to enter your datapoint, don&#8217;t judge yourself too harshly &#8212; if you did better than you feared, then that&#8217;s a success!
</p>
<p>
  If you&#8217;re finding yourself interested in a Beeminder Must-Do goal, give it a go.
You don&#8217;t have to pledge money straight away (or ever if the graph itself is sufficiently motivating) so it&#8217;s a risk-free experiment.
[UPDATE 2020: Beeminder is doubling down on the commitment and risk part and you now have to add a credit card from the start. Whether you can start with $0 pledged is in flux but the point of Beeminder is to hard-commit so never mind this &#8220;risk-free experiment&#8221; bit!]
For your first task, choose the first thing that pops into your head. 
For your next day&#8217;s task, choose whatever you happen to think of when you&#8217;re recording your first day&#8217;s success. 
You don&#8217;t need to plan out a sequence of tasks or keep a list for future days. 
If you discover one evening that you can&#8217;t think of a Must-Do task for the next day, that means you&#8217;ve
  <em>
    done
  </em>
  all of the important things you&#8217;ve been putting off! 
When I get to that point, I intend to enter &#8220;On Tuesday I will revel in my awesomeness!&#8221;

  , but fellow workerbee Clive pointed out that we could flip that negative formulation around. 
Derailing isn&#8217;t just
  <em>

It&#8217;s actively succeeding. 
Or, since obviously it still needs to rhyme, &#8220;Derailing It Is Nailing It&#8221;.

<p>
  At first blush, that might seem weird. 
If you derail, that&#8217;s absolutely an instance of not doing something you set out to. 
It totally makes sense that that
  <em>
    can
  </em>
  feel like failure.
</p>
<p>
  Still, if you take a look at the average Beeminder graph, it&#8217;s
  <em>
    not
  </em>
  a record of the number of times you failed. 
For most people, in most cases, it&#8217;s a record of the number of times you succeeded. 
Even derailments represent getting right back to it after sorting out whatever caused you to derail.
Each derailment is a time you reestablished your commitment to completing your goal by getting back on track.

    title=\\"Do-Zero Goals Considered Harmful\\"
  >
    suggest reframing
  </a>
  them to become Do More goals if you can &#8212; but even then, the line you see is
  <em>
    mostly
  </em>
  showing you all the times you stuck to your limits.
</p>
<p>
  Very inspirational, but never derailing is still better than sometimes derailing, right?
</p>
<p>
  Nope!
</p>
<p>
  If you&#8217;re literally never derailing, then&#8230; well, maybe your goal is just easy and the most minor of threats is enough to keep you on track. 
I&#8217;ve had a few goals turn out that way: the mere presence of the goal is enough to make me do the thing. 
My goal for brushing my teeth, for example (at least
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/toothbrush/\\"
    title=\\"Troubleshooting My Toothbrush -- previous shanaqui post on the Beeminder blog\\"
  >
    since I got that one figured out
  </a>
  ), or my inbox zero goal. 
I don&#8217;t need to be on the edge, and there&#8217;s no real scope for overachievement here. 
Don&#8217;t get us wrong: there&#8217;s definitely a place for these goals in your dashboard.
</p>
<p>
  But for many goals, if you&#8217;re literally never derailing then it&#8217;s
  <em>
    most
  </em>
  likely that your goal isn&#8217;t pushing you at all. 
Occasionally getting that little sting that makes the future consequences of your present inaction
  <em>
    real
  </em>
  .
Then you&#8217;re
  <em>
    really
  </em>
  getting pushed toward your goal. 
It&#8217;s even valuable to get that reminder in circumstances where you might feel the urge to call not-legit.
Valuable enough to pay for, in fact.
</p>
<p>
  Just as an example, lately I haven&#8217;t been calling not-legit on failures on my reading goals, even when the issue is mental health. 
My reading goals are deliberately low in rate &#8212; 5 pages/day &#8212; but they have a ratchet to ensure consistency: 
those 5 pages of progress are due
  <em>
    every day
  </em>
  . 
It might seem like these derailments are not quite fair: I didn&#8217;t fall prey to akrasia, I was sick! 
But&#8230; if I can&#8217;t manage even 5 pages a day, that&#8217;s valuable information for me, and I
  <em>
    need
  </em>
  that wakeup call. 
To just call not-legit misses the point here. 
These goals are important to me, they&#8217;re actually part of my own efforts to help
  <em>
    bolster
  </em>
  my mental health. 
Getting those stings is a
  <em>
    positive
  </em>
  part of these goals.
</p>
<p>
  But that&#8217;s all very &#8220;derailing is not failing (it&#8217;s just giving me useful information)&#8221;, so let&#8217;s take it one step further to where derailing now and then is
  <em>
    actively
  </em>
  making everything better.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;Playing it safe and never being at risk doesn&#8217;t actually reach my end goals&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  Studying the set amount is good; studying more is (usually!) better. 
It&#8217;s healthier to get
  <em>
    any
  </em>
  movement in a given day, but more movement and more often is better. 
And that&#8217;s where Beeminder can really shine, and where you can reap the greatest benefits by setting your rate to something aspirational. 
I can be pretty sure I&#8217;d never derail if my goal was only set to 2,000 steps a day &#8212; but playing it safe and never being at risk doesn&#8217;t actually reach my end goals.
</p>
<p>
  If I set my rate to 5,000 steps a day, when I know I&#8217;d
  <em>
    always
  </em>
  be safe at 2,000 steps a day, I&#8217;m probably going to derail now and then, on busy days. 
But on balance, I&#8217;m doing
  <em>
    way more
  </em>
  toward my overall fitness than I would&#8217;ve if I played it safe. 
Even if I derail this week because I just couldn&#8217;t make it, I&#8217;ve probably done more than 2,000 steps each day. 
Even though I&#8217;m paying the occasional charge for this &#8212; $10 here, $30 there &#8212; I&#8217;m achieving way more than if I&#8217;d played it safe.
</p>
<p>
  Beeminder is great for goals like the ones I mentioned before, where any consequence is enough to keep us from going off the rails. 
But it&#8217;s the GOAT for making us do more than that, for pushing us to overachieve. 
It&#8217;s easy to settle for good enough, and Beeminder makes it possible to commit to being better.
For most goals, derailing it means you&#8217;re nailing it!

  PS: Upon reading this, Bee wondered if we picked the wrong metaphor altogether.
It&#8217;s not derailing, it&#8217;s more like hitting the rumble strip on the highway!

<p>
  <a href=\\"http://nanowrimo.org\\">
    National Novel Writing Month
  </a>
  starts today!
Over a quarter of a million people participated last year, logging over 3 billion words!
Here&#8217;s how the NaNoWriMo site describes it:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    NaNoWriMo is a fun, seat-of-your-pants approach to novel writing.
Participants begin writing on November 1.
The goal is to write a 50,000-word (approximately 175-page) novel by 11:59:59 PM on November 30.
Valuing enthusiasm and perseverance over painstaking craft, NaNoWriMo is a novel-writing program for everyone who has thought fleetingly about writing a novel but has been scared away by the time and effort involved.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Of course, most people (86% last year) who start NaNoWriMo don&#8217;t finish.
And we can imagine why: Sometime after the first few days of excitement you may get a little stuck. 
But you still have weeks left to catch up!
So you let yourself get a little behind.
Repeat every day until the deadline is on top of you and you have to either start pulling all-nighters or give up.
</p>
<p>
  That kind of problem is what Beeminder is made for!
In this case, forcing yourself to spread the writing out over the whole month.
If you get too far behind you&#8217;ll be off your yellow brick road and your graph will freeze.
You&#8217;ll have to pledge money to unfreeze it and keep going.
Do that more than a few times and it will get very expensive!
Pretty soon you&#8217;ll do whatever it takes to get onto your yellow brick road by midnight each day.
Repeat for 30 days and, lo and behold, you&#8217;ve written a goddamn novel.

<p>
  People have been beeminding their writing for a long time, but we&#8217;ve now made it dirt simple to get started.
If you already use
  <a href=\\"http://nanowrimo.org\\">

  then you just tell us your username and we&#8217;ll fetch your wordcount from there.
If you&#8217;re writing in a Google doc, we can fetch your wordcount automatically as you write (pardon the scary-sounding permissions you have to grant us).
We can also do that if you&#8217;re writing in an Etherpad or anywhere else that generates a publicly accessible URL from which we can grab a wordcount.

  Beeminder works brilliantly for quantifiable, graphable goals.
What about nebulous projects like 
remodeling your kitchen or 
finding a therapist?
It doesn&#8217;t really work for those things.
Unless!
Unless you find a clever

  .
Like the word count in a log of your progress.
</p>
<p>
  Here&#8217;s what I recommend:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Create a blank document to serve as a diary or engineering log
  </li>
  <li>
    Create an
    <a
      href=\\"http://beeminder.com/urlminder\\"
      title=\\"This just means beeminding the total wordcount for a set of documents, like Google docs, that can be shared via an unguessable URL\\"
    >
      URLminder
    </a>
    goal to beemind the wordcount of that document
  </li>
  <li>
    Start by describing the problem and listing tasks
  </li>
  <li>
    Add an entry each day (or however often Beeminder makes you) describing what you tried, what&#8217;s working, what you&#8217;ll try next
  </li>
  <li>
    When you&#8217;re ready to declare the project a success, hit archive on the Beeminder goal
  </li>
  <li>
    Use the last week when Beeminder still has you on the hook to add a summary and post-mortem
  </li>
  <li>
    Optional: Add a draft of a Beeminder forum post describing what you did and what you learned!
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  The best part is, after that initial setup you never need to touch the Beeminder goal again.
It&#8217;s fully automated &#8212; you just type words in your document and Beeminder yells at you when you haven&#8217;t typed enough.
</p>
<p>
  For best results, share your log/diary/document with a friend or friends or even publicly.
(Adding

  in Beeminder can help too.)
That way you&#8217;ll be too ashamed to exploit the loophole of blathering on about what you might do without actually ever doing it.

  </a>
  a couple years ago.
I interviewed her in the Beeminder Community Discord and she had this to say:
</p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
  This is still one of my favorite techniques from the forum.
When there&#8217;s a thing that requires lots of unstructured work, but it&#8217;s not something amenable to being timed, Giant Google Doc of Doom is my strategy of choice.
To meet the word count initially, I find myself immediately compelled to write an outline and a rough timeline, and boom, now I have a plan!
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    <br>
    &nbsp;
    <br>
    It also encourages best-practices like putting dates on everything (that&#8217;s an extra word!) and putting contact info directly in the doc, which means less hunting things down as the project continues.
I keep a very low daily word requirement but cap the safety buffer so I always have to do something every couple days.
I find once I open the document and add info, it&#8217;s really easy to add a bunch of notes, so the important part is just making sure I&#8217;m opening the doc pretty frequently.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Lanthala also pointed out how nicely flexible this is.
When she was beeminding buying a house, she could often choose:
add 10 new house links, or write a full breakdown (square footage, yard size, neighborhood, etc) for one house.
Beeminder just ensured that she add 10 new words.
</p>
<p>
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/achilles\\"
    title=\\"Beeminder&#39;s Achilles Heel\\"
  >
    Last time here on the blog
  </a>
  we talked about a trick for overcoming the activation energy of starting a new Beeminder goal.
This nebuminding system, as we sometimes call it, also achieves that.
There&#8217;s no up front planning, you just open a blank document and create the Beeminder goal.
</p>
<p>
  Here&#8217;s one final trick, incorporating something like the
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/mustdo\\"
    title=\\"Classic Beeminder blog post from 2012: The One Must-Do Task Each Day\\"
  >
    Must-Do system
  </a>
  . If the next thing you need to do on your nebulous project is something you&#8217;re dreading, like calling a contractor, type the following in your nebu-doc:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Next step: Call the dang contractor &#8212; NO TYPING MORE UNTIL THAT&#8217;S DONE
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Et voila, Beeminder is making you do the next necessary task the next day, or whenever your next beemergency is for adding more words to your project log.
</p>
<p>
  Lanthala spent a year using a Giant Google Doc of Doom, as she calls it, for all her tasks on everything, using that trick.
These days we recommend

  >
    Complice
  </a>
  for your to-do list.
But opening a blank document and (automatically) beeminding the wordcount remains a good way to take the plunge on a new, nebulous project and ensure that you&#8217;ll eventually see it through.
Or at least end up with an informative post-mortem on why you failed.

  Let&#8217;s start with an intuition-shaping factoid: 
GitHub is focused 100% on developers even though writers and designers and many other categories of people could be &#8212; ought to be! &#8212; using version control. 
(Additional factoid: 
GitHub was worth $7.5 billion when Microsoft bought them, with tens of millions of users &#8212; all programmers.)
</p>
<p>
  And Facebook, despite all its mainstream appeal now, started out focused exclusively on college students.
Harvard students, specifically.
In fact, their early growth strategy was to very carefully and deliberately add a single university at a time and only much later expand beyond university students.

There&#8217;s a lot of value in only having one kind of user to worry about. 
Product design and making users happy is hard and gets combinatorially harder the more kinds of users and use cases you have to support.

  We should emphasize that there are plenty of issues with Beeminder&#8217;s usability to this core demographic; more on that below.
Also, I&#8217;m exaggerating how narrow our core demographic is.

  Counterintuitively, it&#8217;s the opposite!

    title=\\"&#39;How to Get Startup Ideas (2012)\\"

    essay on startup ideas
  </a>
  . He describes two types of startups: 
those that a large number of people need a little, and
those that a small number of people need a lot.
(He also explains why startups can&#8217;t be the best of both, and why he calls the second type &#8220;digging a deep well&#8221;.)
</p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Nearly all good startup ideas are of the second type. 
Microsoft was a well when they made Altair Basic. 
There were only a couple thousand Altair owners, but without this software they were programming in machine language. 
[&#8230;]
  <br>
  &nbsp;

  In practice the link between depth and narrowness is so strong that it&#8217;s a good sign when you know that an idea will appeal strongly to a specific group or type of user.

<p>
  It&#8217;s an artifact for the consumption of software developers which includes basically no software.
  <br>
  &nbsp;
  <br>
  It&#8217;s a book about writing which intentionally anti-targets 99.99% of writers.
  <br>
  &nbsp;
  <br>
  Why? Because constraining the topic to the needs of software developers specifically makes
  <em>
    the artifact much better
  </em>
  (you know you&#8217;re writing for someone who cares about e.g. blog posts to get senior developer jobs and not midlist fiction, and can tailor advice appropriately).
  <br>
  &nbsp;
  <br>
  And note that you certainly could have hypothetically written Writing For $PROFESSION for literally any profession but choosing Software Developers means you structurally have a client who has effectively infinite budget for books which deliver career effectiveness.

  It&#8217;s mostly about what we shouldn&#8217;t do.
Like if we&#8217;re, say, explaining a hypothetical new feature to show a non-cumulative version of graphs, we can call it a derivative and not bother to define what a derivative is.
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"DERIV1\\"
    href=\\"#DERIV\\"
  >
    [2]
  </a>
  In other words, we should do what comes naturally to us.
When talking amongst ourselves, it wouldn&#8217;t occur to us define terms like &#8220;derivative&#8221;.
So the main thing to do is not hold back &#8212; let our freak flags fly!
</p>
<p>
  At this point, when this was just an internal memo, I emphasized that I was less certain about this than I sounded.
Now it seems almost obvious.
But also it matters less than it sounds in terms of Beeminder&#8217;s roadmap.
Regardless of the degree to which we want to double down on nerds, there&#8217;s a long list of things we need to do to make Beeminder better for nerds and normals alike.
Things like
lifecycle emails, 
smoothing onboarding friction, 
getting confusing advanced shıt out of sight of newbees, 
 
 
 
 
fixing the miasma of brokenness with scheduled breaks / ratchets / weekends-off / restarts, 
interactive graphs and
  <a
    href=\\"https://graph.beeminder.com/tutorial\\"
    title=\\"Huge thanks to Uluc for making this; I&#39;m eager to get it in front of more newbees!\\"
  >
    graph.beeminder.com/tutorial
  </a>
  and
  <a
    href=\\"https://graph.beeminder.com/sandbox\\"
    title=\\"This one is less newbee-friendly but is pretty powerful!\\"
  >
    graph.beeminder.com/sandbox
  </a>
  .
The list goes on and on and there&#8217;s a huge newbee focus in most of it.
</p>
<p>
  When normal humans can pass
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/\\"
    title=\\"AKA informal usability tests -- see #12 in The Joel Test\\"
  >
    hallway tests
  </a>
  &#8212; and it&#8217;s critical that they be able to! &#8212; only then, at the earliest, should we think about adjusting copy and marketing and UI and everything to target them.
In the meantime, almost all our onboarding and newbee-related problems have best-of-both-worlds solutions.
We&#8217;re not backing ourselves into any corners (not more so than we already are, at least) with our nerd focus.
The work ahead of us involves improving onboarding and reducing confusion in ways that applies equally to nerds and normals.
</p>
<p>
  At some point we&#8217;ll find ourselves deciding between choice A that&#8217;s better for QS-y Quentin and choice B that&#8217;s better for Normal Norman and that&#8217;s when we can revisit this.
(But probably the answer will be a resounding &#8220;Choice A! Norman can suck it&#8221; for the foreseeable future.)
</p>
<h3>
  Other benefits of focusing on nerds
</h3>
<p>
  First of all, it helps our own focus, our clarity, even our motivation to be helping fellow nerds.
Relatedly, our distinctive voice and vibe and culture is pretty key to us having True Fans (which holy cow do we ever have, and it feels amazing).
Next, being a bit exclusionary &#8212; even alienating users who aren&#8217;t quite your target audience &#8212; attracts and endears and generates passion among those who are.
They feel part of an in-group.
</p>
<p>
  As a bonus, nerds tend to be easier and more valuable in support.
Maybe sometimes they can be a bit much, but very positive on net, we&#8217;ve found.
</p>
<h4>
  Troll filtering and expectations management
</h4>
<p>
  It&#8217;s infuriating when people leave low-effort 1-star reviews in the app store.
Sometimes they do that without even logging in and there&#8217;s little we can do about that.
But &#8212; and this one is more conjecture so far &#8212; making it obvious that Beeminder is for nerds 
(equations on the splash screen, we&#8217;re not sure yet) 
will tend to make those trolls&#8217; eyes glaze over and not bother trolling.
</p>
<p>
  Or imagine someone who&#8217;s like &#8220;Goals? I have goals!&#8221; and starts signing up and then sees graphs and numbers and is like &#8220;WTF? 1 star.&#8221;
The more front-and-center the graphs and numbers are, the less likely they are to feel frustrated and disappointed.
</p>
<h4>
  Anti-example
</h4>
<p>
  Take our oldest competitor,
  <a
    href=\\"https://stickk.com\\"

Or you could say they target anyone who&#8217;s

  >
    akratic
  </a>
  &#8212; those who struggle to stick to their intentions &#8212; but that&#8217;s still far too broad a swathe of the population.
They&#8217;re clearly trying to have mainstream appeal and they just end up being, well,

</p>
<p>
  <br>
  &nbsp;
  <br>
</p>
<p>
  On that slightly meanspirited note, we rest our case.
Broadening our appeal too soon is at least one classic startup mistake we&#8217;ve avoided.
We can

  </a>
  Actually there&#8217;s an interesting selection bias here.
The thesis of this post is very standard startup wisdom.
Those who know it don&#8217;t think to mention it to us.
After all, we seem to be doing it.
(Also no one thinks to mention to us that we&#8217;re smart to have an API or to have smartphone apps or to, I don&#8217;t know, label the axes on our graphs.
Also

  .)
So we don&#8217;t tend to hear from those who agree that Beeminder should focus on nerds.
In any case, we do change our minds aplenty and have done plenty of 180s based on feedback and advice, but in this case, after a lot of thought, we&#8217;ve decided to double down on our initial instincts.

  UPDATE:
We originally described this way too vaguely and seemingly insultingly by saying we shouldn&#8217;t do things like &#8220;try to dumb down our webcopy&#8221;.
Not remembering calculus emphatically does not make someone dumb!
We, as Beeminder, just take it as a background assumption that you&#8217;re conversant in that kind of language.
We&#8217;re always delighted to clarify and explain if you ask!

<h2>
  The Basics
</h2>
<p>
  How Beeminder works is you tell us your goal and we map that to a Bright Red Line on a graph.
As long as you keep your datapoints on the right side of that line you&#8217;re safe, but if you fall off we&#8217;ll charge you money! 
Goals start with $0, so if you fall off once we will not charge you, but the amount at risk increases each time.
</p>
<h3>
  Apps vs. Website
</h3>
<p>
  Our

  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/beedroid\\"
    title=\\"Blog post about our Beeminder Android app\\"
  >
    Android
  </a>
  apps are meant to be auxiliary to the website.
They&#8217;re great for entering new data, getting reminders, and having a dashboard of your progress.
But creating new goals, adjusting your bright red line, and other configuration needs to be done on the website.
</p>
<h2>
  Creating a Goal
</h2>
<p>
  When you sign up and click the
  <em>
    New Goal
  </em>
  button, we ask what type of goal you want.
We talk about the different types below.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    Noob Tip
  </strong>
  :
  <em>
    Don&#8217;t be nervous about trying goals out. 
For new goals (less than a week old) if you don&#8217;t like what you&#8217;ve made you can immediately delete it. 
This means you are free to experiment with goals, and try them out for a few days to see if you like them. 
To delete a new goal, click the &#8220;STOP/PAUSE&#8221; tab underneath the graph. 
(After a week the option to instantly delete goes away but you can still archive a goal with a week&#8217;s notice.)
Go experiment and try new things!
  </em>
</p>
<h2>
  Goal Types
</h2>
<h3>
  Do More
</h3>
<p>
  This is the most frequent type of goal and is for habits you want to do more of.
Like running, going to bed on time, studying, or flossing your teeth.
</p>
<p>
  Sometimes people overlook this goal type because their goal is to do something regularly, but not necessarily increase how much of it they&#8217;re doing. 
But truly, this is almost always the type of goal you want!
You can think of it as &#8220;do more than I would do otherwise&#8221;.
</p>
<h3>
  Weight Loss
</h3>
<p>
  This one&#8217;s pretty self-explanatory!
Weigh yourself every day and report your weight to Beeminder.
If you have a Withings or Fitbit Aria scale you can hook these up to enter your data for you automatically.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    Pro Tip
  </strong>
  :
  <em>
    It&#8217;s a hard-won insight for a lot of Beeminder users (ourselves included!) that you should mostly beemind things you have direct control over (inputs vs outputs, or actions vs outcomes).
Most users find it useful to beemind their weight as an outcome, so they&#8217;ve got a modest weight slope and a handful of steeper goals for the activities that will cause them to lose weight: 
exercise more, eat less sugar, eat more veggies, etc. 
It&#8217;s generally easier to stick to goals that have a well-defined task you can complete to stay on the right side of the bright red line.
  </em>
</p>
<h3>
  Do Less
</h3>
<p>
  Do Less goals require the
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/premium\\"
    title=\\"Premium plans are: Infinibee, Bee Plus, and Beemium\\"
  >
    Infinibee premium plan
  </a>
  (except for those fed by automatic data sources &#8212; see below).
This is for things you want to do less of, like drinking alcohol or coffee, or spending money on frivolous things. 
Our Do Less goals aren&#8217;t quite as intuitive as our Do More goals, so it might be worth reframing your goal as a Do More. 
For example, instead of having a Do Less goal where you are trying to minimize how many days you buy lunch from the unhealthy fast food place, you can set up a Do More goal where you are trying to maximize how many days you are packing your lunch.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    Pessimistic Presumptive Reports
  </strong>
  (
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/less/\\"
    title=\\"We have a whole 'nother blog post about this\\"
  >
    PPRs
  </a>
  ).
A difficulty with Do Less goals is that you can stay on track by just failing to enter data.
For example, if you forget to enter how many cups of coffee you had at work, you&#8217;d actually get credit as if you&#8217;d had none!
This can easily defeat the whole point of beeminding if you&#8217;re prone to sticking your head in the sand &#8212; the very problem Beeminder is supposed to fix!
Our remedy for this problem is that if your deadline rolls around and you have not entered any data yet, we presume that it was because it was a Bad Day, and automatically add a pessimistic datapoint for you.
Adding a real datapoint makes the pessimistic presumptive one self-destruct.
</p>
<h3>
  Odometer
</h3>
<p>
  Odometer goals also require the
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/premium\\"
    title=\\"Premium plans are: Infinibee, Bee Plus, and Beemium\\"
  >
    Infinibee premium plan
  </a>
  (except for those fed by automatic data sources &#8212; see below).
This is mainly used either for actual odometers, like your bike odometer, or things like pages read. 
Think of it like the odometer in your car. 
If you&#8217;re at 100,000 miles and then you drive 5 miles, your odometer will say 100,005. 
So if you want to read 100 pages a week, instead of having to count how many pages you read that day, you can just enter in what page you&#8217;re currently on.
Whether odometer or not, Beeminder plots the cumulative total on your graph.
It&#8217;s just a question of whether Beeminder adds the numbers for you or if you effectively have an odometer that does that for you.
</p>
<p>
  There&#8217;s even a trick for if your odometer gets reset, or, if you start a new book but want your cumulative total mileage or pages read to keep increasing.
We&#8217;ll point you to

    title=\\"Really short version: you enter a zero datapoint when the odometer should reset\\"
  >

  </a>
  for that kind of nitty-gritty.
</p>
<h3>
  Automatic Data Sources
</h3>
<p>
  We can automatically pull data from many other sources outside of Beeminder so that you don&#8217;t have to enter data manually. 
Highly recommended for removing friction and temptation to weasel!
</p>
<p>
  We integrate with some hardware devices, including the
  <a

    title=\\"The Beeminder founders can vouch for this being insanely high quality\\"

  are gadgets you wear that automatically send Beeminder your number of steps, active hours, or calorie expenditure, among other things.
</p>
<p>
  Check out the front page of
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/home\\"
    title=\\"Reminders with a sting\\"
  >
    Beeminder
  </a>
  for the dozens of other devices and services we integrate with.
Note especially IFTTT and Zapier which let you automatically send data to Beeminder from hundreds of other apps.
</p>
<h2>
  Parts of Your Graph
</h2>
<p>
  Your goal page has a graph, and a place to enter data below it, as well as your most recent datapoints. 
Above the graph is a countdown for how many days you have until you derail (if you enter no more data) and how much more you need to do to get another day of safety buffer.
</p>
<h3 id=\\"ybr\\">
  The Bright Red Line
</h3>
<p>
  Previously known as the
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/glossary/#ybr\\"
    title=\\"Yes, this is a link to our glossary\\"
  >
    Yellow Brick Road
  </a>
  , 
this is the ideal path to your goal &#8212; what you said you want to do. 
If your datapoints are always falling somewhere on this path, then you are in no danger of derailing.
If they are orange you will cross the red line tomorrow if you do nothing.
If your datapoints are blue you have two days of slack before an
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/glossary#eep\\"
    title=\\"Glossary entry for 'eep day', aka 'beemergency'\\"
  >
    emergency day
  </a>
  .
If your datapoints are green that means you have actually earned some time off. 
If you fall into the red zone (the
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/glossary/#b\\"
    title=\\"Glossary entry for the bad side of the bright red line\\"
  >
    bad side of the line
  </a>
  ) 
then you have to get your datapoints back on the good side by midnight (or whatever deadline you&#8217;ve set) or the goal will derail.
</p>
<h3 id=\\"horizon\\">
  Akrasia Horizon
</h3>
<p>
  This dotted line marks one week in the future.
Most changes to your goal, especially ones that make it easier, don&#8217;t take place until after the
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/glossary#ahorizon\\"
    title=\\"Glossary entry for the Akrasia Horizon\\"
  >
    Akrasia Horizon
  </a>
  line. 
So it is easy to change your mind about a goal for next week but you can&#8217;t just change your mind out of frustration or laziness Right Now.
</p>
<h3 id=\\"dial\\">
  Commitment Dial
</h3>
<p>
  If you do change your mind about your goal and you want to make it easier or harder on yourself, you can change the steepness of the bright red line using the
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/glossary#dial\\"
    title=\\"Glossary entry for the commitment dial\\"
  >
    Commitment Dial
  </a>
  below the graph in the &#8220;COMMITMENT&#8221; tab.
Say your current rate of 10 per week is too hard.
You can change it and the red line will adjust after the Akrasia Horizon.
</p>
<p>
  There are three fields: Goal date, Goal total (or final goal value), and Rate.
One is always grayed out, as setting two of those fields implies the third. 
If you want to run 10 miles per week until your birthday, you would set the goal date and the rate. 
In that case the middle box would be grayed out, but it&#8217;d also show you how many miles you will have run if you make it successfully all the way to the end of the goal.
</p>
<h2>
  Entering Data
</h2>
<p>
  You can enter data by text message, responding to the bot emails, via the apps, or entering it into the data entry box below the goal. 
The format for entering data is: day-of-the-month datapoint &#8220;comment&#8221;.
So let&#8217;s say it is February 8th, and you weigh 150 pounds, and want to comment that it was a birthday party so you ate a lot of cake.
You would enter:
</p>
<pre>
  <code>
    8 150 \\"birthday cake\\"
  </code>
</pre>
<p>
  As a shortcut you can enter ^ to mean &#8220;today&#8221;, ^^ to mean &#8220;yesterday&#8221;, and so on. 
So let&#8217;s say that you want to enter in that you watched 3 Dr. Who episodes yesterday, you would enter:
</p>
<pre>
  <code>
    ^^ 3
  </code>
</pre>
<p>
  (UPDATE: What counts as &#8220;today&#8221; vs &#8220;yesterday&#8221; depends on the deadline, which defaults to midnight.)
</p>
<p>
  You can enter multiple datapoints at one time under your graph too:
</p>
<pre>
  <code>
    ^^ 1 \\"Transfinite Train Theory\\"
^^ 1 \\"Owl Triangulation on the Kolsky Peninsula\\"
  </code>
</pre>
<p>
  (Another UPDATE: The above is for the advanced entry tab. By default the &#8220;New Data&#8221; tab should make entering datapoints self-explantory.)
</p>
<h3>
  Reminders
</h3>
<p>
  You will receive email reminders around 9:30am on emergency days by default. 
You can also reply to these messages to add data to your goal. 
You can adjust the time of day of these reminders in the goal&#8217;s settings.
If it is an emergency day, you&#8217;ll continue to get warnings more and more frequently throughout the day as long as you are still off track. 
We call this
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/zeno\\"
    title=\\"Nerds will be able to guess the reminder schedule we use based on this name\\"
  >
    zeno polling
  </a>
  . 
You can turn those off in reminder settings as well.
</p>
<h2 id=\\"derailing\\">
  Derailing
</h2>
<p>
  If you have a datapoint that has crossed the bright red line (the datapoint will be red) then it&#8217;s an emergency day. 
You have until the end of the day to get back onto the good side of the line or you&#8217;ll derail!
</p>
<p>
  For most goals, especially most
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/glossary#autodata\\"
    title=\\"A goal that has an automatic data source\\"
  >
    autodata goals
  </a>
  , 
you derail at midnight.
UPDATE: Deadlines are now customizable in Settings.
</p>
<p>
  Once you&#8217;ve
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/glossary#derail\\"
    title=\\"Glossary entry about derailing\\"
  >
    derailed
  </a>
  , 
the bright red line moves itself to your most recent datapoint, and gives you a week of flat spot.
This is so that you aren&#8217;t stuck trying to play catch-up to a goal you&#8217;re already behind on. 
If you don&#8217;t want to be allowed to slack off for a week, you can set your &#8220;days of mercy&#8221; after derailing at the bottom of the &#8220;COMMITMENT&#8221; tab to as little as 2.
Then your red line will still jump to where you are currently, but it will continue upward at your previous rate from that point forward, without the flat week.
</p>
<h3 id=\\"legit\\">
  Legit Checks
</h3>
<p>
  Every time you derail, before any charge goes through we&#8217;ll send you a &#8220;legit check&#8221; email. 
This is us asking if the derailment was legitimate
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/legit/\\"
    title=\\"Weasel-Proofing and the Definition of Legitimacy\\"
  >
    or if you just forgot to enter data, or whatever
  </a>
  . 
If you let us know that the derailment wasn&#8217;t legitimate, we&#8217;ll cancel the charge and undo the derailment. 
You have 24 hours to respond to the legitimacy check before the charge goes through! 
(We can refund a charge that&#8217;s already gone through, if you had an emergency and couldn&#8217;t respond in time, but we prefer to cancel charges before they go through because it&#8217;s slow/costly to issue refunds.)
</p>
<p>
  If you want us to hold you to a higher standard you can check the
  <em>
    Weaselproof Me
  </em>
  box in the goal settings.
Then we might ask for additional proof of your exceptional circumstances, such as a snapshot of you with your doctor, or a tweet or other public announcement of your excuse, for example.
</p>
<h3 id=\\"pledge\\">
  Pledges
</h3>
<p>
  [UPDATE: Some of this is moot because it&#8217;s no longer possible to create a goal without having entered a credit card or other payment info.]
</p>
<p>
  If you derail on a goal and haven&#8217;t entered a credit card, we&#8217;ll freeze the goal until you do.
And we won&#8217;t charge it to your card at that point either, because there was still $0 on the line.
But to continue your goal, you&#8217;ll need to make a $5 pledge, which we&#8217;ll charge the next time you derail.
</p>
<p>
  With each additional derail, we increase the amount of money you have pledged. 
It

    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/exponential/\\"
    title=\\"Blog post about the exponential pledge schedule\\"
  >
    gets expensive fast
  </a>
  , 
from $5 to $10 to $30, $90, $270, $810. 
If $810 sounds insanely expensive to you, that&#8217;s fine! 
Once you reach an amount of money that is sufficiently motivating, you can opt out of further increases in your pledge. 
Click the pledge above the graph and choose a pledge cap.
</p>
<h2 id=\\"done\\">
  Giving Up
</h2>
<p>
  Sometimes you decide you no longer want to continue a goal. 
Perhaps you had a change in your life situation, or just changed your mind. 
If this happens you can always decide to archive a goal by archiving it (top of the &#8220;STOP/PAUSE&#8221; tab). 
This will freeze your goal and put it in your archived goal gallery.
The bot won&#8217;t bug you about it and it will, for most intents and purposes, be deleted, though still resurrectable.
</p>
<p>
  The tricky part is that, like many other changes to your goal, it doesn&#8217;t take effect until a week has passed, so you can&#8217;t just archive a goal to keep from derailing! 
Instead, when you push the Archive button we start a timer. 
When the timer hits zero your goal will be archived.
</p>
<p>
  Often, you&#8217;ll learn more about your goal by starting to do it.
So instead of stopping altogether, you might just want to use the commitment dial instead and make it much easier.
A good rule of thumb for goals that you want to keep bubbling in the background is to ask:
  <em>
    &#8220;What&#8217;s the bare minimum I want to do of this?&#8221;
  </em>

So this seems like a good time to congratulate Nick on getting married to that very girlfriend last month!

  It&#8217;s dark. Warm. Safe. You&#8217;re in bed, about to fall asleep.

</p>
<p>
  You forgot. You got behind. 
You skipped CrossFit yesterday, but Beeminder said that was okay as long as you did it today instead. 
You meant to, but life happened. 
At this point, you think, 
&#8220;I am sumptuously swaddled in my favorite luxury bedding material, it&#8217;s late, and there is no way I&#8217;m going out in the street to do the workout-of-the-day in the dark, by myself, in my pajamas. 
And Beeminder will just charge me $5 this time. Okay, deal. Zzz.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
  But I think there&#8217;s a better way to use Beeminder. 
When this happened to me, I didn&#8217;t even have to think about what to do; I just found myself out there grunting my medicine ball against a telephone pole and jumprope-sprinting into gloomy rosebushes.

  It wasn&#8217;t even worth considering losing my wager over the tiny matter of some physical discomfort. 
What wager? Not money &#8212; just the certainty that I will always do what I promise myself I will do.
</p>
<p>
  See, the real cost of failing a goal is not the loss of your Beeminder pledge money. 
It&#8217;s the loss of confidence that you will meet all future goals that you perceive as similar to the current goal. 
You will trust yourself less. 
And because the motivation to pursue a goal is largely based on your confidence of success, that blow to your confidence will demotivate you, making you more likely to fail. 
You can easily get into a failure cycle and have to abandon hope in any goal-setting mechanism that seems similar to Beeminder 
(or to the Beeminder-before-you&#8217;re-

<p>
  Lame, right? But think about the converse. 
Every time you succeed with Beeminder, you become more confident in succeeding at goals you put into Beeminder. 
You gain even more confidence when you succeed at harder goals. 
If you play it right, you can use the
  <a href=\\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/3w3/how_to_beat_procrastination/\\">
    research-backed technique of success spirals

</p>
<p>
  The confidence damage from failing is still huge compared to the confidence boost from succeeding, so to do success spirals right, you don&#8217;t ever want to fail a goal. 
But how can you completely stop failing when you&#8217;re starting off as a normal human who wins some and loses some? 
Just trying harder isn&#8217;t going to work.
</p>
<p>
  There are many tricks to becoming a fail-proof superhuman, many of which I detail in my book,
  <a
    href=\\"http://www.nickwinter.net/the-motivation-hacker\\"
    title=\\"The Beeminder founders are in love with this book, for reasons that will become clear if you read it!\\"
  >
    The Motivation Hacker
  </a>
  . 
It&#8217;s about using precommitment, Beeminder, and other tricks to accomplish an insane number of goals all at once. 
(I wrote it as a clever precommitment strategy to get myself to accomplish said insane goals, one of which was writing the book.) 
I&#8217;ll describe a few of these tricks that relate to Beeminder.
</p>
<p>
  First, make Beeminder easier. 
Perform triage on goals and habits you&#8217;re not confident about. 
Keep the ones you know you can do in Beeminder. 
For the rest, either take them out of Beeminder until later, or make them easier. 
Turn &#8220;study Chinese for half an hour a day&#8221; into &#8220;study Chinese for at least one second, five days a week.&#8221; 
Make them input-based (&#8220;write in my journal&#8221;) instead of output-based (&#8220;come up with two good ideas&#8221;). 
Make sure you&#8217;ll win.
</p>
<p>
  Part of this is making sure that you remember to check Beeminder and plan your goal completion efforts accordingly. 
I used to have problems remembering to enter the data, or forgetting what I had to do, because I just hadn&#8217;t looked at Beeminder or read my email. 
Now I have every active Beeminder goal in a bookmark folder that automatically opens in a bunch of new tabs every night so that I can enter data and make sure I&#8217;m on track.
</p>
<p>
  Another part is making sure that you never lie to Beeminder. 
Okay, maybe you wouldn&#8217;t out-and-out falsify data &#8212; but if you had gone to yoga instead of CrossFit that day, well, at 11:30 PM, you might think, hmm, maybe that counts? 
Does it? Well, what did you write for the fine print on your CrossFit goal? 
Didn&#8217;t think of this scenario? Right.
</p>
<p>
  Experts at
  <a
    href=\\"http://rationality.org/\\"
    title=\\"Center for Applied Rationality\\"
  >
    CFAR
  </a>
  recommend practicing the mental art of Murphyjitsu: 
imagining everything that can possibly go wrong that would lead to failing the goal, and then outplanning Murphy. 
&#8220;I&#8217;m going to do CrossFit three times a week&#8221; should immediately lead to problems and solutions like:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    &#8220;Which days?&#8221; &rarr; &#8220;Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, at 5:30 PM, after work, with an alarm set, and with my workout clothes always in my car.&#8221;
  </li>
  <li>
    &#8220;What if I can&#8217;t go during gym hours?&#8221; &rarr; &#8220;If I can&#8217;t make CrossFit, then any exercise of equal or greater intensity and duration will suffice.&#8221;
  </li>
  <li>
    &#8220;What if I&#8217;m sick?&#8221; &rarr; &#8220;I don&#8217;t go if I&#8217;m too sick to go to work, otherwise I go.&#8221;
  </li>
  <li>
    &#8220;What if I&#8217;m, like, really really tired though?&#8221; &rarr; &#8220;I go anyway but take it easy if I need to.&#8221;
  </li>
  <li>
    &#8220;What if I&#8217;m injured in a car accident?&#8221; &rarr; &#8220;Obviously don&#8217;t worry about it. Also, I need a first aid kit in my car.&#8221;
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  But you still want to do some hard goals now, before you&#8217;ve had a long time to build up your success spiral. 
Life would be boring if you never tried to do anything you weren&#8217;t confident you could do. 
So here&#8217;s what you do: set one hard goal. 
Go ahead and make it scary-hard, until you feel nervous just thinking now about writing soon about committing to do it three months from now. 
Yeah, that&#8217;s it.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;The rest will be easy, because you already know you’re going to win.&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  Now make yourself sure that you&#8217;ll succeed. 
Use every motivation strategy you know, every trick in
  <a href=\\"http://www.nickwinter.net/the-motivation-hacker\\">

  subscription feature to jump to any pledge level. 
You can be done planning and precommitting in fifteen minutes, and you&#8217;ll feel confident about that goal that just seemed so hard it was scary. 
Cheerful, even. Excited, yes. Motivated. 
After all, you just did the hard part. 
The rest will be easy, because you already know you&#8217;re going to win.

  It was almost eerie how well it worked. 
I wasn&#8217;t afraid during the plane&#8217;s ascent or even when I went to jump out of it. 
Then I actually jumped and it was even worse than I had imagined &#8212; I couldn&#8217;t decide whether to pass out or throw up. 
Well, bad goal. But at least it helped build up my trust in myself!
</p>
<p>
  I present this always-succeed strategy based both out of my own experiences doing twenty-seven Beeminder goals over the past couple years and on plenty of psychological

I&#8217;m not saying there aren&#8217;t other ways to do it, but it&#8217;s not like I just made this stuff about success spirals up, either.

  Don&#8217;t build the habit of failing at Beeminders. 
Build the habit of trusting yourself to do what you said you would do. 
Then, after you&#8217;ve succeeded at everything without ever paying $5 to the beautiful Beeminder bosses, you can just

We recently took a poll of daily and weekly beemail subscribers and (tied for) most popular was hearing more from Support Czar Nicky on how we&#8217;re so preternaturally good at support.
So Nicky&#8217;s arm has been twisted and here we have it, from the horse&#8217;s mouth!

  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  I&#8217;m going to tell you a secret about doing Beeminder&#8217;s support for 3+ years, and why I am good at what I do. 
(No false modesty here &#8212; I can always be better than I am right now, but right now I&#8217;m pretty good.)
</p>
<p>
  It&#8217;s not having a preternaturally good memory for names and situations. 
I do have that, and it certainly
  <em>
    helps
  </em>
  , because it speeds things up, and I have the information I need right at my fingertips. 
Say a user&#8217;s name and if I&#8217;ve handled emails with them more than twice in the last six months, I probably know who you&#8217;re talking about. 
But that&#8217;s not critical: software can help you do that, because you can just make notes or search back in the archives to see what you&#8217;ve said to a user before.
</p>
<p>
  It&#8217;s not about being infallible, because I&#8217;m definitely not. 
And it&#8217;s not even knowing how to handle it when you do fail, though learning to fail with grace really did help me along the way.
</p>
<p>
  It&#8217;s not about reading all the bug reports filed and the commits merged, though I do keep a pretty good handle on that. 
It really helps keep you hooked into what
  <em>
    might
  </em>
  go wrong. 
But if it&#8217;s going to take me more than a couple of minutes to figure things out, it&#8217;s probably time for me to pass it on to someone more technical anyway.
</p>
<p>
  It&#8217;s not &#8212;
</p>
<p>
  Okay, I&#8217;ll stop telling you what it&#8217;s not and start telling you what it is. 
The number one thing that makes me good at doing support for Beeminder is the fact that I
  <em>
    use
  </em>
  Beeminder. 
Not just a little bit: at the time of writing, I have 66 goals. 
I use Beeminder to track my studying, eating habits, remembering to moisturise my hands, the
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/bookcase\\"
    title=\\"Previous Beeminder blog post by Nicky about beeminding book-reading\\"
  >
    books I&#8217;m reading
  </a>
  &#8230; 
I&#8217;m regularly creating goals, deleting goals, archiving goals, derailing goals, playing around with my graphs, changing the settings&#8230; 
and I have no better access to my own goals than anyone else. 
I use Beeminder like any other user, and I can&#8217;t do special admin workarounds to get past things that are annoying or weird.
</p>
<p>
  (Like seriously, this goes all the way. 
I have to write into
  <a href=\\"mailto:support@beeminder.com\\">
    support@beeminder.com
  </a>
  when I need help. 
If I try to call not legit and it sounds a bit weaselly, the other workerbees will call me on it. 
When I derail, I pay up and see the money going out of my personal bank account. 
In every aspect, I have to use the service the same as anyone else.)
</p>
<p>
  And of course, because of that I run into problems like any other user. 
Sometimes I&#8217;ll be the first user to run into a bug, which is definitely handy.
I&#8217;m very well motivated to make a thorough bug report so we can get it fixed, and don&#8217;t mind being asked a barrage of questions about what I did until we can
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/bugreports\\"
    title=\\"Old Beeminder blog post about so-called proper bug reports\\"
  >
    pin down
  </a>
  exactly how to reproduce a bug!
</p>
<p>
  The most important superpower this gives me, though, is that I know how everything works from the user&#8217;s point of view. 
I&#8217;ve changed that setting you need to ask me about for myself; I&#8217;ve used that integration; I&#8217;ve seen that error message that you only half-remember, and I remember the rest of it. 
Most of the time, I don&#8217;t need to load up the site and check &#8212; and if I do, I know exactly where I need to go. 
I&#8217;ve set up some really weird goals over time, so I have ideas about how to make things work&#8230; and I use Beeminder for such a wide range of things that inevitably I also run into ways in which Beeminder is frustrating.
</p>
<p>
  Basically, I understand exactly what users are going through. 
And
  <em>
    that
  </em>
  is what makes me great at support. 
If you&#8217;re doing support, you need to understand your software not on the nuts-and-bolts end, as a developer, but as a
  <em>
    user
  </em>
  . 
I have no technical qualifications whatsoever, but I&#8217;m rarely stumped when it comes to Beeminder itself.
</p>
<p>
  When the
  <em>
    whole
  </em>
  team do this, you get even more benefits, because different people need to use things differently, and they break things in different ways. 
Even though I use Beeminder so much, if there was something weird about high pledges I&#8217;d never know from my own experience, because my own motivation point is pretty low. 
But all workerbees use Beeminder in their own way, so we get all kinds of perspectives on user experience just from within our own team.
</p>
<p>
  So my number one tip for any team is:
  <em>
    use your own service
  </em>
  . 
All of you. Devs, support, social media managers, testers,
  <em>
    everyone
  </em>
  . 
No special access, no extra privileges, maybe even no discounts or special pricing.
</p>
<p>
  If you don&#8217;t use your own service, as a user, you&#8217;re missing half the picture.

People seem into it!
Which is good because it was setting the stage for this announcement:
We&#8217;ve killed the old
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/legit/\\"
    title=\\"Blog post in which we first described weaselproofing, back in 2013, with some addenda\\"
  >
    weaselproofing feature
  </a>
  and replaced it with something we think is much better:
No-Excuses Mode.
</p>
<p>
  To put the bottom line up front, especially for future readers who may not care much what weaselproofing used to be, here&#8217;s what No-Excuses Mode means:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    You can&#8217;t call non-legit on a derailment unless there was a Beeminder bug
  </li>
  <li>
    The closing of various loopholes with autodata
  </li>
  <li>
    You can&#8217;t delete the goal even in the first week
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  That&#8217;s the only offering we have as of today &#8212; No-Excuses Mode or nothing.
If you don&#8217;t opt in to that then, as always, you can reply to the email we send when you derail and explain why the derailment was not legit and we will believe you and cancel the charge.
We email you when you derail regardless of whether No-Excuses Mode is on, but if it&#8217;s on then the email is mainly an FYI.
</p>
<h3>
  What was wrong with weaselproofing? (And what was it?)
</h3>
<p>
  Before today, turning on weaselproofing for a goal meant that if you derailed and then replied to the legit check that the derailment wasn&#8217;t legit, we&#8217;d ask for proof of your excuse.
Doctors&#8217; notes, screenshots, a friend vouching for you.
Something like that.
It also included numbers 2 and 3 above, about closing loopholes and not being able to delete a goal in the first week like you normally can.
</p>
<p>
  So what was wrong with that?
Several things!
For starters, it was never very popular.
Maybe most important, the implied distrust was kind of icky.
Most pragmatically, it turned out that processing the proof &#8212; examining screenshots, pulling in people to vouch for the excuse, and just the general back-and-forth &#8212; was quite costly for us.
If you want that level of human interaction, you&#8217;re probably looking for something like our friends and integration partner,
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/baas\\"
    title=\\"Guest post on the Beeminder blog by the founder of Boss as a Service, also introducing the Beeminder/BaaS integration\\"
  >
    Boss as a Service
  </a>
  .
Finally, it just encouraged the wrong mentality.
See 
&#8220;
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/depunish/\\"
    title=\\"This post makes the case for reframing how you think of derailments. They&#39;re not punishments that you deserve or don&#39;t deserve and thus that it can make sense to have excuses for.\\"
  >
    Paying Is Not Punishment
  </a>
  &#8221; for the mentality we do want to encourage.
</p>
<p>
  Ok, enough about weaselproofing!
Good riddance.
</p>
<h3>
  Does No-Excuses Mode mean literally
  <em>
    no
  </em>
  excuses?
</h3>
<p>
  The only exception to &#8220;no excuses&#8221; is for technical problems that are Beeminder&#8217;s fault.
We also take responsibility for our official integration partners.
But that&#8217;s not transitive.
If you&#8217;re getting data from, say, Zapier and Zapier itself has an outage, that counts as our fault.
If the service you connected at the other end flakes out, that&#8217;s a risk you&#8217;re taking.
</p>
<p>
  Are we really so heartless that we&#8217;re going to tell someone tough luck if their internet goes out, or they get cancer?
My contention is that you should factor all those risks in when you click that button.
No matter how cold-hearted it may make us feel, it would defeat the point of No-Excuses Mode to override the derailment charge via any kind of human discretion.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;No-Excuses Mode is not for weasels. It&#8217;s for the most impressive, hard-core Beeminder users.&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  Opting in to no-excuses mode means you accept that some derailments will happen that you didn&#8217;t have a way to prevent but that those will be rare enough. 
You value the brightness of the bright red line enough that the occasional &#8220;unfair&#8221; derailment is worth it. 
Partly it&#8217;s a quantified-self-über-alles mentality. 
It doesn&#8217;t matter why you crossed the red line. 
The data is what it is and you either kept it on the right side of that line or you didn&#8217;t.
</p>
<p>
  That has some appeal to the most impressive Beeminder users.
</p>
<p>
  Which is in stark contrast to weaselproofing. 
The most impressive Beeminder users have no temptation to weasel and need no insurance against doing so. 
But opting in to No-Excuses Mode is just the maximally hard-core version of Beeminder.
Many of us want that.
</p>
<h3>
  What if some weasel makes an excuse anyway?
</h3>
<p>
  We&#8217;ll cross that bridge if we come to it but here&#8217;s some brainstorming.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Hi Userperson, your
    <a
      href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/barfingcats\\"
      title=\\"Barfing Cats and Other Stories from Talking to Weasels in Support\\"
    >
      cat got sick
    </a>
    , you say?
Sounds like you don&#8217;t want No-Excuses Mode on this goal after all? 
You can go ahead and turn it off and that will take effect right away. 
But for this derailment we&#8217;d be derelict in our duty as a commitment device if we canceled the charge when No-Excuses Mode was turned on. 
Does that feel fair?
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Or maybe just leveraging guilt could suffice: 
&#8220;Ok, we&#8217;ll ultimately do what you say but you very explicitly promised not to tell us to cancel the charge here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
  We could even conceivably dial it to eleven and say (more diplomatically than this) that we can cancel the charge but only by deleting your Beeminder account.
The reasoning would be that not paying the pledge is a failure to hold up your end of the commitment contract.
Violating the sanctity of that means ruining your relationship with Beeminder.
By that reasoning, insisting on your money back is tantamount to admitting that you don&#8217;t have sufficient
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/typebee\\"
    title=\\"Highly self-flattering blog post about what we Beeminder users are like\\"
  >
    integrity
  </a>
  for Beeminder to help you and so we simply break up.
</p>
<p>
  Again, this is just brainstorming!
</p>
<p>
  We can&#8217;t and won&#8217;t actually ever keep money you don&#8217;t ultimately choose to give us so if we really want to enforce No-Excuses Mode, deleting your account would be the most leverage we have.
We predict that that&#8217;s utterly unnecessary though.
</p>
<p>
  There&#8217;s just one more potential excuse to consider, that might actually be common, though necessarily not from you, dear reader who&#8217;s reading this whole blog post.
Namely, what about someone who clicks the button to opt in to no-excuses without actually reading what they&#8217;re agreeing to?
The initial implementation looks as follows, admittedly not the most conducive to ensuring the user has their eyes wide open about this.
</p>
<p>
  <img
    class=\\"aligncenter\\"
    alt=\\"Screenshot with 'OPT IN TO NO-EXCUSES MODE' button\\"
    src=\\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46881/155112538-44905238-b948-4ca2-af8b-4d966fbabd0f.png\\"
  >
</p>
<p>
  Mostly this is another bridge we&#8217;ll cross if we come to it.
We could make you type something to prove you understand what you&#8217;re agreeing to.
Alternatively we could just treat &#8220;I didn&#8217;t read what I clicked on&#8221; as the only other exception to No-Excuses Mode &#8212; just that you can only use it once.
Telling us next time that you forgot to uncheck the box certainly wouldn&#8217;t cut it.
</p>
<h3>
  Anything else?
</h3>
<p>
  One other change that&#8217;s part of this switch from weaselproofing to No-Excuses Mode is that we&#8217;ve dropped the akrasia-proofing.
If you opted in to the old weaselproofing, we wouldn&#8217;t let you turn it back off (without talking to us and waiting a week).
After all, you had declared yourself a weasel.
But No-Excuses Mode is not for weasels.
It&#8217;s for the most impressive, hard-core Beeminder users.
So you&#8217;re free to opt in and out at will.
</p>
<p>
  (That does defeat some of the point, like locking yourself in on a newly created goal.
We have a solution to that coming:
You&#8217;ll be able to instantly archive and delete any goal that has $0 pledged on it.
If you want to lock yourself in, just bump it up to a non-zero pledge.
Again, that&#8217;s not the status quo yet, just what we have planned.
We&#8217;ll likely prioritize it based on how many people tell us they really need a way to lock themselves in on new goals.
UPDATE: People do not seem to need this! The idea is now on hold.)
</p>
<p>
  We&#8217;re pretty excited about the direction this is moving us.
Of course we have a big ulterior motive here.
More people opting into No-Excuses Mode will obviously tend to make us more money.
We think that&#8217;s all highly win-win, that it will also push you harder and make you get more done, or do more of whatever you&#8217;re using Beeminder to do more of or do less of what you&#8217;re using Beeminder to do less of.
</p>
<p>
  It may even help set the stage for eventually
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/focus\\"
    title=\\"Beeminder blog post about how we&#39;re pledge-focused now, rather than premium-focused\\"
  >
    getting rid of premium plans
  </a>
  .
Maybe eventually No-Excuses Mode can just be How Beeminder Works with some way to (insert wild hand-waving here) outsource an excuse-making version to Boss as a Service somehow? 
We don&#8217;t know yet how or if that can work but maybe we&#8217;ll think of a way now that we&#8217;ve cleared out this weaselproofing monstrosity!
</p>
<p>
  <br>
  &nbsp;
  <br>
</p>
<p>
  UPDATE: We added a small deterrent to opting back out of No-Excuses Mode right before you derail. 
Try it to see what we mean!

pioneered the idea of a web service to facilitate commitment contracts but has nothing like Beeminder&#8217;s yellow brick road.
The contracts are of the form &#8220;I will do thing X by date Y&#8221;.
Beeminder&#8217;s &#8220;I will keep my datapoints on track every day&#8221; gets much more to the heart of akrasia.
We&#8217;re quite proud of that insight and discuss it at length in our 
inaugural blog post and before that in a

  But it took us another year to come up with the idea of the road dial and the akrasia horizon.
Until then we experimented with all manner of convoluted ways

  </a>
  to deal with the flexibility problem and the difficulty in choosing what to commit to.
It&#8217;s now perfectly obvious that the answer is to decide what to commit to as you go along, subject to an akrasia horizon.
As

  , by Thaler and Sunstein, will find our Third Epiphany especially obvious: 
defaults are very powerful. 
But for more than an additional year after coming up with the road dial and akrasia horizon, we were still letting your graphs freeze whenever you derailed and waiting for you to decide to unfreeze them and try again. Lunacy!

  The psychology that brings people to Beeminder in the first place tends to go hand in hand with this kind of myopia (or is it optimism?), and makes them put their head in the sand and fail to restart a failed goal.
That&#8217;s exactly the problem Beeminder purports to solve.
So now we try to apply that reasoning everywhere we can.
We have an exponential pledge schedule that starts at $0 or $5 so that you don&#8217;t have to agonize about how much money to put at stake.
We created
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/less/\\"
    title=\\"TODO\\"
  >
    Pessimistic Presumptive Reports
  </a>
  so that you can&#8217;t weasel out of a Do Less commitment by putting your head in the sand and simply not reporting data.
And of course we have focused on
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/tag/integrations\\"
    title=\\"All blog posts tagged &#39;integrations&#39;\\"
  >
    autodata integrations
  </a>
  so you can hold yourself accountable without entering data at all.
</p>
<p>
  Lest you think that we&#8217;re exploiting the Third Epiphany to line our pockets at our users&#8217; expense
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"PERV1\\"
    href=\\"#PERV\\"
  >
    [3]
  </a>
  we also apply the principle to make sure you don&#8217;t pay for a premium plan you&#8217;re not using.
Namely, if you stop using Beeminder altogether you don&#8217;t have to get your head out of the sand to cancel your premium subscription.
We notice you&#8217;ve left and
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/autocancel/\\"
    title=\\"Of course this is easy for us to do since we only make 10% of our revenue from premium subscriptions -- the rest is from pledges\\"
  >
    cancel it for you automatically
  </a>
  .
In every case we can anticipate, the thing you mean to do is what happens automatically, the path of least resistance.

    it turns out
  </a>
  that Beeminder making money is quite compatible with making our users awesomer.
The following is an idealization but there&#8217;s sufficient truth in it: 
You start beeminding and we keep you on track until your current pledge runs out of motivational power. 
It runs out of motivational power when Beeminder has provided enough value that you&#8217;re not averse to paying the pledge! 
So you derail, pay, and re-rail at a higher pledge amount. Rinse, repeat.
It&#8217;s the opposite of what people tease us (not always good-naturedly) about: 
The more Beeminder becomes a critical part of your life &#8212; the more awesome it makes you &#8212; the more you pay us. 
Yes, Beeminder gets paid at moments of failure, but most people re-rail. 
So those failures are temporary and just serve to reemphasize how valuable Beeminder has been.
Maybe that&#8217;s too idealized but it&#8217;s empirically and anecdotally true that paying money to Beeminder correlates with overall success not failure.
Or, as we say, if you never pay Beeminder then you probably didn&#8217;t really need it that badly.

    title=\\"Blog post introducing Precommit-to-recommit which is now becoming just part of what it means to beemind something\\"
  >
    The Third Great Beeminder Epiphany
  </a>
  :
Ever-increasing awesomeness should always be the path of least resistance.
Namely, if you derail on a goal, the goal no longer freezes and waits around patiently while you decide whether or not to continue. 
Instead, you&#8217;re automatically recommitted at the next pledge level and given a week off &#8212; either a flat spot or a higher limit (for set-a-limit goals [UPDATE: now called Do Less goals]).
In other words, we&#8217;re making precommit-to-recommit universal, along with some related changes to make that neither scary or limiting.
</p>
<p>
  At first blush this may seem like you&#8217;re more committed to a goal than you were before. 
After all, before you could just let a goal derail and walk away &#8212; no more risk, no more reminder emails guilt-tripping you into flossing. 
In fact, these changes just mean that you have to
  <em>
    tell
  </em>
  Beeminder that you want to walk away from a goal. 
The path of least resistance is now to stick with a goal until you reach it. 
Letting goals sit in a derailed state runs counter to everything that Beeminder purports to help eliminate, namely, procrastinating on becoming more awesome.
Crying uncle at any time is very easy (subject to the akrasia horizon).
It&#8217;s right at the top [UPDATE: now a big red button in the sidebar; even more obvious than the original link at the top] of the goal page &#8212; so it&#8217;s easy in the sense that it&#8217;s obvious how to do it. 
It might not be so easy to unequivocally declare defeat on something your second-order self really wanted to achieve.
</p>
<h2>
  The Fine Print
</h2>
<p>
  We&#8217;ve made a number of subtle updates to the rules around archiving that make this even more palatable. 
For one, if an archive countdown is in progress on a goal when it derails, that goal will simply derail and not get recommitted. 
You&#8217;ll still pay the pledge (for that one derailment), but we honor your intention to end the goal.
</p>
<p>
  Also, after you&#8217;re recommitted to a goal, by default you&#8217;re given a week off &#8212; either a flat spot or a higher limit (for set-a-limit [UPDATE: now called Do Less] goals).
You can get rid of this week off by checking the &#8220;no mercy&#8221; option in goal settings. 
You can also use the Retroratchet button as a one-time tool to get rid of the flat spot.
</p>
<p>
  Even if you
  <em>
    have
  </em>
  checked that no-mercy option, we still recommit you at a more lenient rate if that&#8217;s what you&#8217;ve requested &#8212; your road rate will immediately jump to whatever it is at the akrasia horizon. 
For example, if you&#8217;ve been doing 10 widgets/week, but recently decided to cut back to 5/week (because 10 was too much), and then you derail (&#8230;because 10 was too much), you&#8217;ll immediately be at 5 widgets/week, and you won&#8217;t keep derailing on the too-steep rate.
</p>
<p>
  Lastly, if the notion of automatically climbing the pledge schedule is intimidating (we think it&#8217;s
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/exponential/\\"
    title=\\"Intrafamily Bets and the Genius of the Exponential Pledge Schedule\\"
  >
    genius
  </a>
  , 
but we&#8217;re biased), you can turn off automatic climbing in your goal settings. 
New goals will climb the pledge schedule by default since that&#8217;s the path to ever-increasing awesomeness, but we&#8217;re okay with the fact that some people will become more awesome if they stay on the hook at $30 rather than walk away because having $90 on the line was too daunting.
[UPDATE: This is now done by setting

</p>
<h2>
  Nudge Power
</h2>
<p>
  To summarize the reasons that this is not as scary as it sounds:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>
      Anytime archiving.
    </strong>
    If you&#8217;ve hit the Archive button, even one second before derailing, the recommit will not happen. Your graph will just freeze and you can safely walk away.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      Rerailing with flat spots.
    </strong>
    You&#8217;re rerailed with a week of flat spot so you can get yourself back off the hook even after the auto-rerail happens by flattening your road again the same day. In other words, even after the derailment there&#8217;s still 24 hours to cry uncle with no further commitment.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      Dropping the pledge back down.
    </strong>
    Although by default you’re bumped up to the next pledge level, you can always drop back down to your previous level. Yes, that takes a week, but you’re flat for that week so there isn’t much risk of paying the higher pledge.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      Legit check email.
    </strong>
    You still get the legitimacy check email when you derail and can cry foul if anything went wrong. The email just also informs you that you’re back on the hook already if you do nothing.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      Deadman switch.
    </strong>
    If you stop using Beeminder altogether for a month then we won&#8217;t keep putting you back on the hook. Instead your graphs will just freeze when you derail and you can choose to unfreeze them if/when you come back.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      Frictionless archiving.
    </strong>
    We&#8217;ve moved the Archive button to the top of the goal page 
[UPDATE: side of the page but big and red so you can&#8217;t miss it; NEW UPDATE: it&#8217;s in its own tab &#8212; &#8220;STOP/PAUSE&#8221; &#8212; below the graph]. 
No friction for deciding to cry uncle at any time.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      Humans to the rescue.
    </strong>
    If anything didn&#8217;t go as you expected, reply to the legit check email (or email
    <a href=\\"mailto:support@beeminder.com\\">
      support@beeminder.com
    </a>
    directly) and we (humans) will fix it.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Again, the only fundamental difference in this so-called new world order is that you have to make an explicit choice to give up on a goal instead of having that happen by default because you meant to restart a goal but didn&#8217;t get a

    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/tuit\\"

But, especially for the kind of people who need Beeminder, that makes all the difference in the world.

<h3>
  Addendum: FAQ
</h3>
<h4>
  1. What happens to my goals that are currently hanging around in a frozen state?
</h4>
<p>
  We&#8217;re just letting you archive those. There&#8217;s still the one-week delay, mainly for consistency.
</p>
<h4>
  2. What if I derail because I&#8217;m on vacation or something?
</h4>
<p>
  Flatten your roads before you go on vacation.
Even if you don&#8217;t flatten in time to prevent a derailment, you&#8217;ll rerail with a flat road so you won&#8217;t derail again until you unflatten.
(In the case of Set-A-Limit [Do Less] goals you can both flatten the road and turn off pessimistic presumptive reports. 
Then the goal is in a state that you can safely ignore it as long as you want, dangerious as that is for an akratic person!)
</p>
<h4>
  3. So I have to be more careful about planning in advance with this new rule?
</h4>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;We were careful to not make things any more onerous or less flexible&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  No, note the part in the previous answer about &#8220;even if you don&#8217;t flatten in time&#8221;.
We were careful to not make things any more onerous or less flexible or anything.
The difference is that you have to explicitly give up instead of giving up implicitly by sticking your head in the sand.
But no additional pre-planning is needed. 
Giving up even the day after the derailment ensures you won&#8217;t derail again (unless you opt-in to the no-mercy version, of course).
</p>
<h4>
  4. What exactly does it mean for a goal to be archived?
</h4>
<p>
  It&#8217;s like being frozen.
You can see all your archived goals (link under your avatar picture) and unarchive them at will.
(Possibly we&#8217;ll change the terminology to &#8220;freeze&#8221; once the old world order, where freezing meant derailing, is a faded memory! 
[UPDATE: We&#8217;re keeping the distinction because goals can still freeze, if you derail but haven&#8217;t added a credit card. Archived means both frozen and stashed away out of sight.])
</p>
<h4>
  5. I tend to ramp up until I hit my failure point and then scale back; that&#8217;s a problem with an auto-recommit at the same rate, right?
</h4>
<p>
  No, you&#8217;ll just want to stick with the default of merciful recommits (don&#8217;t check &#8220;no mercy&#8221;) which gives you plenty of time to adjust the rate after a derailment.
And with Retroratchet now smarter, you can get rid of the mercy flat spot after the fact, too.
In fact, that&#8217;s why we made sure to smarten up Retroratchet before deploying this, so you have no less control over what your yellow brick road does immediately after derailing than you had with manual unfreezes.
</p>
<p>
  And even if you want no-mercy recommits for other reasons, note how we rerail you at the akrasia horizon rate, not your current rate.
So as long as you can anticipate the derailment even one second before it happens, you have control over what the new rate will be when you rerail.
</p>
<h4>
  6. What if I literally die? Will my credit card keep getting charged?
</h4>
<p>
  No, currently we use a month as the threshold (same as
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/autocancel\\">
    auto-canceling subscriptions
  </a>
  )
for the dead-man switch 
(UPDATE: To clarify, the deadman switch activiating means we stop rerailing you, so charges will stop some time after a month depending on your post-derail respite setting).
We definitely won&#8217;t keep charging you indefinitely if you&#8217;re not actively engaged with Beeminder.
And, if you haven&#8217;t actually died, you can always reply to the legit check email to tell us what happened and we&#8217;ll gladly stop any errant charges.
</p>
<p>
  <br>
  &nbsp;
  <br>
</p>
<p>
  UPDATE: Probably anyone who reads this whole blog post will be fully sold on universal precommit-to-recommit but, shockingly, not everyone does.
So we finally caved and added an &#8220;auto-quit&#8221; option to advanced settings.
If you don&#8217;t want to be auto-rerailed just check that box and your graph will freeze when you derail, just like in the olden days.
</p>
<p>
  UPDATE 2018: Now that this is mostly a distant memory we&#8217;re finally fully killing the auto-quit option!

  After adding
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/jawbone/\\">

  last month, I realized that we could be approaching an asymptote in Beeminder&#8217;s coverage for integrations. 
We&#8217;ve covered some of the most popular apps and devices, but their numbers are exploding, and there&#8217;s no way we could hope to keep up.
Even by beeminding them &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t pass the
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/wantcanwill/\\">

  .
We still get a ton of
  <a href=\\"http://beeminder.uservoice.com/search?filter=merged&amp;query=integrate\\">
    requests for integrations
  </a>
  though, for everything from Codecademy to Mint to Google Glass. 
And it seems like whenever we add an official integration, there are always a few people who wish it worked a little differently

  </a>
  , all the tools for building and modifying Beeminder integrations already exist!
We&#8217;ve done a bad job advertising this fact, though, so here&#8217;s how you can 1) beemind anything under the sun, and 2) let other Beemindees do the same thing &#8212; because who doesn&#8217;t like to see the things they&#8217;ve built used by other humans?

  from such blog posts as last month&#8217;s
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/draft/\\">
    NaNoWriMo
  </a>
  announcement. 
URLminder is a standalone app that takes a number of URLs, and, once per day, counts the number of words in those documents and reports the total to Beeminder.
It&#8217;s deployed on Heroku and its source code is
  <a href=\\"https://github.com/beeminder/urlminder\\">
    published on GitHub
  </a>
  .
[UPDATE: URLminder is now built in to Beeminder, not hosted as its own thing on Heroku anymore.]
</p>
<p>
  So how does it work? Assuming you don&#8217;t want to just RTFC.
The app itself is a very simple Rails app. 
There&#8217;s a model for a
  <a href=\\"https://github.com/beeminder/urlminder/blob/master/app/models/goal.rb\\">
    Goal
  </a>
  , 
each instance of which corresponds to a Beeminder goal.
A Goal has an array of public URLs that we want to count words for, and some methods to go out and count the words.
</p>
<p>
  The interesting part is how it connects to Beeminder.
URLminder takes advantage of the fact that Beeminder is an OAuth2 provider, thanks to the excellent
  <a href=\\"https://github.com/songkick/oauth2-provider\\">
    provider gem from Songkick
  </a>
  .
So when someone signs up for URLminder, they&#8217;re directed to Beeminder where they see a screen asking them if they want to allow URLminder to access their Beeswax. 
If they do allow it, Beeminder gives URLminder an access token, and now URLminder can do things on that user&#8217;s behalf, like create a goal and update it when the word count changes.
</p>
<p>
  Here&#8217;s the best part &#8212; you can do this yourself!
Anyone can create a Beeminder app by going to
  <a href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/apps\\">
    beeminder.com/apps
  </a>
  . 
You&#8217;ll also see apps that you&#8217;ve authorized here.
You&#8217;ll get a client_id and a client_secret that you&#8217;ll use to allow people to authorize your app to access their Beeminder data.

    id=\\"HIP1\\"
    href=\\"#HIP\\"

    [3]
  </a>
  Since these are sensitive, they&#8217;re not checked into version control in URLminder, but there is a
  <a href=\\"https://github.com/beeminder/urlminder/blob/master/config/heroku_env.rb.sample\\">
    sample config file
  </a>
  you can crib from.
I&#8217;m using (approximately) the approach outlined in a
  <a href=\\"http://tammersaleh.com/posts/managing-heroku-environment-variables-for-local-development/\\">
    blog post by Tammer Saleh
  </a>
  .
</p>
<p>
  If you want to try this out, you could fork URLminder and have it go out and fetch, for example, your points total from
  <a href=\\"http://www.codecademy.com/apb\\">
    Codecademy
  </a>
  .
The total is sitting there teed up in a nice little span with a class called &#8220;stat-count&#8221; &#8212; it&#8217;s just waiting for you to point Nokogiri at it!
The only real modification would be to tweak the
  <a href=\\"https://github.com/beeminder/urlminder/blob/master/app/models/goal.rb\\">
    count_words method in the Goal model
  </a>
  and plug in the client_id and client_secret values from the Beeminder app you create.
</p>
<p>
  So get coding! We&#8217;ll put the integrations in a gallery of some kind once we figure out a process for vetting them.

      Incidentally, am I alone in finding the expression ‘it turns out’ to be incredibly useful?  It allows you to make swift, succinct, and authoritative connections between otherwise randomly unconnected statements without the trouble of explaining what your source or authority actually is.  It’s great.  It’s hugely better than its predecessors ‘I read somewhere that&#8230;’ or the craven ‘they say that&#8230;’ because it suggests not only that whatever flimsy bit of urban mythology you are passing on is actually based on brand new, ground breaking research, but that it’s research in which you yourself were intimately involved.  But again, with no

      authority anywhere in sight.

<p>
  It&#8217;s our first ever listicle!
We tried these out in a daily and weekly beemail and even among those most hardcore users, many didn&#8217;t know about many of these features.
For the average feature in this list, 30% of daily subscribers and 40% of weekly subscribers weren&#8217;t aware of it.
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"CONTROL1\\"
    href=\\"#CONTROL\\"
  >
    [1]
  </a>
  So here they are, listed from least obscure to most obscure:
</p>
<h2>
  1. Cap your pledge at any level you like
</h2>
<p>
  Actually everyone we asked knew about this.
And you likely do too since we&#8217;ve
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/pledgecaps\\"
    title=\\"We introduced this in 2014\\"
  >
    blogged about it
  </a>
  but it wasn&#8217;t obvious to newbees until recently when we made it a very prominent part of goal creation.
</p>
<h2>
  2. Edit past datapoints
</h2>
<p>
  Another one that all the hardcore people know about.
You can edit past datapoints by clicking All Data. 
A lot of newbees miss that.
We&#8217;re working on a lot of UI changes to address problems like this!
UPDATE: The
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/redesign\\"
    title=\\"Hooray Josh Pitzalis and Andy Brett\\"
  >
    2016 redesign
  </a>
  elegantly unobscured this.
</p>
<h2>
  3. Insta-delete goals in the first week
</h2>
<p>
  This is important for experimenting but it&#8217;s one feature that perhaps should be sort of obscure, to avoid the temptation of loophole abuse.
In fact, we recently made it easier to close that loophole for yourself.
If you check the &#8220;weaselproof me&#8221; box for a goal then it won&#8217;t let you delete it even in the first week.
</p>
<h2>
  4. Customize where the x-axis starts
</h2>
<p>
  You can change x-min in goal settings as a cumbersome way to zoom your graph.
</p>
<h2>
  5. Timer built in to the Beeminder Android app
</h2>
<p>
  It&#8217;s super useful! 
Swipe on the data entry part of the interface to switch to the timer (or tally mode &#8212; recommended for counting pushups with your nose).
</p>
<h2>
  6. Snooze deadlines if still more than 6 hours out
</h2>
<p>
  (I didn&#8217;t think to include this one in the original poll of hardcore users so I&#8217;m just guessing where it would&#8217;ve fallen in this list.)
You can always change your deadline if it&#8217;s not an
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/glossary#eep\\"
    title=\\"AKA beemergency\\"
  >
    emergency day
  </a>
  .
If it is, you still can, until you&#8217;re within 6 hours of derailing, then you can&#8217;t.
</p>
<h2>
  7.
  <strike>
    Push graphs to the bottom or top of your gallery
  </strike>
</h2>
<p>
  UPDATE: We got rid of this feature and replaced it, for now, with an
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/redesign\\"
    title=\\"See #7 in new features and #2 in lost features\\"
  >
    even more obscure tagging feature
  </a>
  .
</p>
<p>
  <strike>
    We call this
    <a
      href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/glossary#backburner\\"
      title=\\"Backburnering/frontburnering is simply a means to organize your goal gallery, shoving goals that you don’t need top-of-mind to the bottom of the list. When you mouse over a goal thumbnail in your gallery you’ll see an icon in the upper right that toggles whether it appears above or below the line separating frontburner from backburner goals. Backburnering a goal doesn’t mean archiving it, and the bot reminders and pledges are unaffected.\\"
    >
      backburnering
    </a>
    . 
You can click the corner of graph thumbnails to move them above/below the fold in your goal gallery. 
We intend to replace this with richer tagging/sorting features, or at least a simpler pinning feature.
  </strike>
</p>
<h2>
  8. Rescaling utility to convert goal to different units
</h2>
<p>
  Halfway through the list and it&#8217;s getting obscure indeed.
This feature is at the bottom of Terrifyingly Advanced settings. 
You can, e.g., multiply all your data and road rates by 1/60 to convert an existing goal from minutes to hours.
</p>
<h2>
  9. Goals default to public, datapoints private
</h2>
<p>
  Actually this has gotten much less obscure with our new goal creation wizard which highlights these settings.
Goals are default public with datapoints (in particular the comments) default private. 
We really want to encourage public graphs for greater accountability and showing off progress, but it was bad for these settings to be obscure so they&#8217;re now less so.
</p>
<h2>
  10. Get reminded and enter data via Slack
</h2>
<p>
  We&#8217;re so excited about this one that we got the domain
  <a
    href=\\"http://slackminder.com\\"
    title=\\"If you use Slack, this will hook you up\\"
  >
    slackminder.com
  </a>
  which you should click on if you use both Beeminder and Slack.
</p>
<h2>
  11. Thicker yellow guiding line indicating week of safety buffer
</h2>
<p>
  You know the thin yellow lines showing the good side of the yellow brick road? 
Well one of them is thicker than the rest and that represents a week of safety buffer.
</p>
<h2>
  12. Hide the numbers on the y-axis
</h2>
<p>
  In case you want to show off your graph without revealing the actual numbers.
This is another Terrifyingly Advanced setting.
Probably all of those settings belong in this list.
Especially the ones for custom goals, which you need a

    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/premium\\"
    title=\\"Blog post introducing the premium plans. Short version is it costs $8/month for custom goals.\\"

  </a>
  for.
</p>
<h2>
  13. Gmailzero can track arbitrary Gmail queries
</h2>
<p>
  This is another one we
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/gmailzeroer\\"
    title=\\"Gmail Zeroer\\"
  >
    blogged about
  </a>
  but clearly need to make less obscure in the UI.
</p>
<h2>
  14. Enter time as HH:MM:SS
</h2>
<p>
  We call it the
  <a
    href=\\"http://beeminder.com/faq#qcut\\"
    title=\\"FAQ item about this\\"
  >
    colon shortcut
  </a>
  .
The other shortcuts for entering data are on the obscure side as well.
</p>
<h2>
  15. If you have over a week of buffer you&#8217;re immune to the akrasia horizon
</h2>
<p>
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/glossary/#ahorizon\\"
    title=\\"Akrasia is distorted decision-making in the face of immediate consequences and your akrasia horizon quantifies “immediate”. It’s the timeframe within which your short-term impulses outweigh your better judgment — taken by Beeminder to always be one week in the future. You can make arbitrary changes to your goal — the steepness of your yellow brick road — but only outside the akrasia horizon. (You can make your goal harder without waiting for the akrasia horizon; see retroratchet.)\\"
  >
    Akrasia horizon
  </a>
  immunity! 
This was inadvertently a trick question when we polled people but all I meant was that if you have over a week of safety buffer then if something comes up you can immediately flatten your road and &#8212; though it takes a week for the flattening to take effect &#8212; by the time you run out of safety buffer you&#8217;ll have reached the
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/glossary/#flatspot\\"
    title=\\"A period in which your yellow brick road is paused, requiring no work. You may want to add a flat spot for a vacation, for example. You do so by dialing down your road with the road dial. When you start a new goal or rerail, Beeminder by default starts you with a flat spot so you can build up an initialsafety buffer.\\"
  >
    flat spot
  </a>
  .
</p>
<h2>
  16. Use &#8220;take a break&#8221; to schedule a
  <em>
    harder
  </em>
  period
</h2>
<p>
  This was technically the most obscure in our poll but I think it mostly just never occurred to half of folks that this would work, because why would anyone ever do that?
But it&#8217;s true that when you schedule a &#8220;break&#8221; you can actually schedule any rate you want.
</p>
<h2>
  17. [Bonus addition in 2020] Schedule a do-less break with a jump up instead of a steep section
</h2>
<p>
  Instead of using the Take-A-Break feature for a do-less goal, you can use the road editor to
  <a
    href=\\"https://help.beeminder.com/article/157-pessimistic-presumptive-reports\\"
    title=\\"Help page with an FAQ about PPRs\\"

  </a>
  in your road.
The advantage of that is that your

    title=\\"Blog post announcing PPRs for do-less goals (2013)\\"
  >
    Pessimistic Presumptive Reports
  </a>
  (PPRs) won&#8217;t change.
With a steep section your PPRs increase with the steepness of the yellow brick road and so you&#8217;re not buying yourself any additional safety buffer in terms of days you can go without reporting, just in terms of how much of the thing you&#8217;re beeminding you can actually do.
</p>

<p>
  And there you have it.
Feel free to react incredulously in the comments to things you&#8217;re just now learning about.
</p>
<p>
  P.S. Special shout-out to the previously obscure and confusing freebees feature which is now so obscure that
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/deathtofreebees/\\"
    title=\\"Death to Freebees; Or, Freebees Fuer Alles\\"

  .
As you can tell, Beeminder is a bit of a beehemoth, so we were proud recently to have untangled a gnarly knot of complexity.
We&#8217;re working hard to do more of that.

<p>
  Although Beeminder was built on the ideas of Behavioral Economics, it supports both pledge-driven and more purely gamified ways of tracking and pursuing goals.
Beeminder uses pledges to keep your goals on track.
But I&#8217;ve talked to a bunch of people who don&#8217;t like that.
</p>
<p>
  &#8220;Losing money just makes me want to quit!&#8221; a few friends told me.
</p>
<p>
  I could be tapping into a biased sample, but it makes sense that the prospect of losing money could scare people off.
Emotionally, it&#8217;s hard to get around the feeling that losing money equals losing in general.
At the same time, these are competitive and often numbers-driven people.
They want to get to 10,000 steps on Fitbit today before their other friends, they want to log so many dozens of

  </a>
  this week, they want to hit their goal of X miles in RunKeeper.
And these same friends of mine gladly pay for other services and apps they think help their goals along.
</p>
<p>
  They sound like Beeminder users to me. So what gives?
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;Beeminder&#8217;s core tracking functionality is powerful even without pledges&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  Pledges and commitment contracts rightly get front billing when explaining Beeminder.
But Beeminder has some other core aspects that folks might not understand at first glance.
In my own handful of years experimenting with tracking my goals with Beeminder, these other aspects became important in guiding how I formulated goals, and structured my life in general.
For me, these were more important than pledges.
</p>
<p>
  I joined Beeminder back in the day because I was pretty desperate for anything that would help me make progress in my life.
The idea of having something on the line sounded sort of neat, and dramatic, and the people behind Beeminder seemed pretty smart and relatable (in the best nerdy way possible).
</p>
<p>
  So I gave it a try. 
And I lost a fair amount of money in pledges. 
(I won&#8217;t say exactly how much.)
But despite the misteps, I felt that lessons I had learned, on top of the progress I had made, justified the expenses.
I kept tweaking my goals.
I would look at things like: Is it reasonable to expect myself to do this much reading every day?
What do I need to do to make sure I can meet my Japanese audio quota for the day?
Eventually, I became pretty good at specifying goals so I could stay in the game.
I stopped derailing and having to pay the pledges so often.
</p>
<p>
  But over time, I began to see that not losing at my own goals was becoming more important on a daily basis than the threat of paying up when I derailed.
This seems to puzzle some of my fellow Beeminder users who really love the commitment contract aspect.
I offer the heresy that Beeminder&#8217;s core tracking functionality is powerful even without pledges.
By the end of this, I hope to lay out the case that Beeminder is much more than &#8220;losing money when you fail&#8221;.
</p>
<h2>
  Beeminder Without Penalties
</h2>
<p>
  Here, I&#8217;m hoping to take a decent look at some beneficial concepts Beeminder embraces and promotes that
  <em>
    don&#8217;t
  </em>
  have to do with commitment contracts.
</p>
<p>
  Beeminder breaks down goals for you, keeps you engaged, and keeps you focused on day-to-day actions. 
It makes sure those actions are concretely linked to your long term progress.
When you track something, it updates to reflect what you&#8217;ve done, and what you still need to do.
By creating and adjusting Beeminder goals, you improve your overall goal design skills and become more adept at structuring and navigating your life.
I see it as a game framework, but it&#8217;s not a stretch to call it a coaching aid.
</p>
<p>
  Here are a few other things Beeminder does:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Tells you exactly how much you need to do every day, and how much more you need to do if you want to get a day or two or six ahead
  </li>
  <li>
    Lets you track your progress in dozens of different ways, from dozens of different devices and services
  </li>
  <li>
    Friendly support for when you have a problem, or if you&#8217;re confused about something
  </li>
  <li>
    Provides fancy statistics on your progress so far, things like daily averages and 90% variance
  </li>
  <li>
    Keeps your data for you, so you can export it and analyze it later
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  That&#8217;s a lot of stuff already &#8212; much more than penalizing you when you fail.
But I did say I would talk about pledges.
How might those fit in to this picture?
</p>
<h2>
  Something at Stake
</h2>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;Putting a nominal price on a goal reminds me to take the larger picture into account&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  Beeminder can do all these great things for your goals without demanding a single pledge.
I think the core
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/faq\\"
    title=\\"Questions asked at some unquantified frequency\\"
  >
    Beeminder FAQ
  </a>
  and other blog posts have illustrated the Behavioral Economic side &#8212; the case for commitment contracts and the power of loss aversion &#8212; quite extensively.
I want to talk about why pledges can still be valuable to people like me, for whom the tracking and game-like aspects of Beeminder goals are almost sufficient.
</p>
<p>
  Pledges help me be cognizant and deliberate about my commitments.
A lot of my goals are added-value things: from an outside perspective, I wouldn&#8217;t intrinsically lose anything if I called it quits.
I have the tendency to get excited about potential change, and commit to too many things.
But pursuing goals takes resources.
I&#8217;d say that even setting goals takes resources, in terms of anxiety and regret.
Part of the reason I reached out for tools like Beeminder was the weight of the graveyard of incomplete projects and unfulfilled promises I&#8217;d created in the preceding years.
</p>
<p>
  Somehow putting a nominal price on a goal or an aspect of a goal reminds me to take the larger picture into account.
It helps me to devote more time and attention to the fewer goals that are really worth sticking by.
And it helps give me the courage to pursue riskier, more challenging goals, because I have a better idea of what I&#8217;m willing to put at stake.

</h2>
<p>

  before midnight motivates me too sometimes.
Beeminder is a very flexible tool that supports a lot of use cases, and whole different use-philosophies.
These could differ from person to person.
(And maybe also from goal to goal.)
I wanted to make the case for another way to approach and use Beeminder, one that debunks the myth that Beeminder is just about losing money when you fail.
That doesn&#8217;t make the traditional, behavioral economics way of looking at Beeminder any less valid, and I don&#8217;t think the option (via premium subscription) to create pledgeless goals decreases its effectiveness for people who create goals with pledges.
</p>
<p>
  Along this pledge/pledgeless axis, I see Beeminder as a multi-paradigm tool that supports both of these patterns. 
I&#8217;ve wondered what would happen if you emphasized two distinct paths when people first sign up:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Do you love commitment contracts and Behavioral Econ?
Does having to pay a fine for getting off-track really motivate you?
Beeminder was created around those principles, with exponentially increasing pledges (though you can cap them).
And you can try this out for right now &#8212; just create an account, put down a pledge and get to tracking.
We only charge you when you legitimately fail to meet your goal.
    </li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <ol start=\\"2\\">
    <li>
      Beeminder is a tracking and accountability tool. 
It tells you just how much you need to do Right Now to stay on track for your goal.
It features a graph that shows moving averages and trends to show how your daily actions affect your long term progress.
Beeminder lets you track and collect your data from dozens of services and devices.
It has reminders that help you stay on track every single day.
We think having something at stake still helps, but you can track and analyze your goals with an

        title=\\"Danny chimes in: I think auto-canceling makes premium subscriptions just infinitely more palatable. We&#39;re only asking to be paid conditional on you actively getting value out of the service and we mean that so hard that we&#39;re assuming the burden of making it be true.\\"
      >
        auto-canceling
      </a>
      subscription. 
Subscribing also lets you create an unlimited number of goals and unlocks special goal types.
    </li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <ol start=\\"3\\">
    <li>
      = 1 + 2&#8230; of course, combine them! 
Beeminder does both things very well. We believe that commitment contracts and powerful tracking tools are best friends!
    </li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Beeminder&#8217;s animal mascot has two colors: black and yellow. 
Let&#8217;s use them as team colors for the different kinds of Beeminder users.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    Black Team:
  </strong>
  Pledged Commitment Contract Warriors. 
Harness the threat of penalties as their source of power. 
Their raiment is black, showing their fearlessness and relentlessness.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    Yellow Team:
  </strong>
  Elite Tracking Quantifiers. 
Wizards of planning and goal construction, they can engineer tracking and accountability schemes to surmount obstacles. 
Yellow is the color of their order, symbolizing the bright light of their ambitions and devotion to constant learning and improvement.
</p>
<p>
  (Or something like that.)
</p>
<p>
  But the point is that Beeminder is a flexible, multifaceted tool.
Most often it&#8217;s described as tracking and commitment contracts.
But there are many reasons to try it out even if that doesn&#8217;t sound so exciting.
I consider it a game framework for helping you solve problems, create new habits, and chase opportunities for growth.
</p>
<p>
  Beeminder has reshaped the way I approach challenges and ambitions.
I&#8217;ve learned a lot from using it, and I&#8217;m glad to be part of a community so enthusiastic about finding new creative ways to make changes in our lives.

  Answer: Still super crazy!
</p>
<p>
  Before we give a little one-year retrospective, allow us to demonstrate just how crazy we are.
</p>
<p>
  One of our long-time Beeminder users &#8212; and not someone we know in real life &#8212; just paid an $810 contract.
That&#8217;s a new record and tops even me and Bethany.
It sounds so ridiculous, I know, but the other way to think of it is that &#8220;Mortimer&#8221;, as we&#8217;ll call him
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"MOR1\\"
    href=\\"#MOR\\"
  >
    [1]
  </a>
  , has spent hundreds of hours on his yellow brick road that just wouldn&#8217;t have happened without Beeminder.
If the goal is important enough (and you have more money than you know what to do with, which it turns out many people do) then $810 isn&#8217;t necessarily outrageous. 
We have a friend who has spent much more than 6 hours with his $150/hour lifecoach.
</p>
<p>
  I&#8217;ve also heard of people paying someone to literally stand over their shoulder to make them write.
Beeminder was cheaper than that for Mortimer and if the $2,430 he now has pledged keeps him on track for another
  <a
    href=\\"http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%242430+%2F+minimum+wage\\"
    title=\\"WolframAlpha reckons you could get 335 hours of labor at minimum wage for $2,430\\"
  >
    335 hours
  </a>
  of work then it&#8217;ll be cheaper even if he eventually loses this $2,430 as well!
</p>
<p>
  I should emphasize that we&#8217;re not making this up.
A real user, who we didn&#8217;t previously know, coughed up $810 for derailing on a Beeminder goal and his reaction was, &#8220;I guess $810 was insufficiently motivating; let&#8217;s try $2,430!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
  I told Mortimer we&#8217;re more determined than ever to make sure Beeminder always provides more value than pledges it collects so in his case that means we&#8217;re enrolling him for free in Beeminder&#8217;s nascent lifecoaching program.
I.e., Melanie, Beeminder&#8217;s resident fitness expert, will ride his butt and make sure he doesn&#8217;t derail with $2,430 pledged.

  The Beekeeper Program

<p>
  The Beekeeper program was born just last week when a user said they wanted to pay us $200 a month to be like their Beekeeper.
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"BEE1\\"
    href=\\"#BEE\\"
  >
    [2]
  </a>
  Their point is that Beeminder
  <em>
    mostly
  </em>
  subsumes everything a life coach offers, but not quite, so they want to pay for that extra piece:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Entering the data for you
  </li>
  <li>
    Being more persistent about reminders than the bot can be (if the bot tries to be more persistent it backfires since you tune it out)
  </li>
  <li>
    Actually paying attention to the graphs and calling you to discuss how steep to dial the roads
  </li>
  <li>
    Figuring out what metrics to use and how to avoid weaseling (send a picture from the gym?)
  </li>
  <li>
    Whatever other ways you want your Beekeeper keeping you in line (perhaps drawing the line
    <a href=\\"http://hackthesystem.com/blog/why-i-hired-a-girl-on-craigslist-to-slap-me-in-the-face-and-why-it-quadrupled-my-productivity/\\">

  Happy Birthday To Beeminder!

  Remember a year ago today when we officially unmasked Beeminder?
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>

<p>
  Most likely you don&#8217;t because, compared to today, no one had heard of Beeminder back then!
We weren&#8217;t sure
  <em>
    anyone
  </em>
  but our mothers would pay up for a Beeminder goal. 
A year later we&#8217;ve got people (well, Mortimer) paying $810 on a single goal.
In total so far, people have started 10,000 goals with Beeminder, plotted 400,000 data points, and pledged $50,000.
We&#8217;ve also been

  There are a lot of things in the category of &#8220;nerd tendencies I&#8217;ve had to unlearn&#8221;.

Eventually I intend to collect them all into a meta post but here are a few random examples in the meantime:

  Today I have one that&#8217;s a variant of the classic Knuth-ism
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"HOARE1\\"

  </a>
  that premature optimization is the root of all evil.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;Don&#8217;t create premature ontologies&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  Knuth was saying that programmers tend to spend too much time fussing with their code, making it more efficient.
You should profile your code to find the actual bottlenecks and only optimize the code that&#8217;s actually slowing your application down.
</p>
<p>
  I claim that people (well, a certain kind of nerd, including past-me) make a similar mistake with ontologies.
They&#8217;ll start a Discord server and create an elaborate set of channels for all the topics they anticipate people wanting to discuss.
Or create an elaborate set of labels for a new code repository in GitHub, or for their email, or for a filesystem.
</p>
<p>
  So the Anti-Ontology Principle is this:
Don&#8217;t add categories speculatively.
Start with exactly one category in your ontology and add new ones only in response to an actual thing in the actual world happening that makes you actually need a new category.
If you delay that kind of organizing until there&#8217;s a clear and present need, you save yourself a lot of wasted work.
</p>
<p>
  In other words, start with a single umbrella category and then branch it as needed.
Don&#8217;t create premature ontologies!

  I almost clarified that it was originally Hoare who said it, but then I found this claim on Hacker News:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Actually that was Donald Knuth &#8212; it&#8217;s an urban legend that it&#8217;s an urban legend that it was originally Knuth. 
Hoare was quoting Knuth, but Knuth forgot he said it, and re-mis-attributed the quote to Hoare.

  So I officially don&#8217;t know what to believe but calling it a Knuth-ism feels pretty apt regardless.

Or much fewer beemergencies than normal at least.
But then it turned out that whatever that calendar event was got canceled.

I wondered: could I pretend they&#8217;re all still red, dispatch them like usual, turning them all blue, and continue that way indefinitely?

  Answer: no, I&#8217;m way too much of an edge skater for that.
But it can be nice while it lasts and it works very well for some people so we recommend trying it.
PSA!
Schedule a one-day break on all your goals for a week from now and put it on your calendar as orange-is-the-new-red day. 
From that day forward, as long as you can maintain the illusion that orange is red, nothing will have changed in how much you&#8217;re actually doing/did but you&#8217;ll have successfully put a day of emergency buffer in your back pocket.
</p>
<p>
  Of course the exact same thing works for any other color shift. 
You could even get a week of safety buffer and be entirely

  When I first started recommending this I felt nervous that its logical conclusion is not needing Beeminder at all.
But even people who use the trick much more successfully than me assure me that that&#8217;s not at all the case.
Unless you truly do have no need at all for Beeminder, you&#8217;ll eventually eat into your safety buffer and even

  <strong>
    Welcome Pact users!
  </strong>
  The title of this post isn&#8217;t
  <em>
    exactly
  </em>
  true but we want to quickly scare away the people who were just using Pact for the free money.
We don&#8217;t like to say Beeminder is all stick and no carrot (ok, we
  <a

  </a>
  that all the time) but Beeminder&#8217;s carrots are all non-monetary:
Fancy graphs of your progress, an elaborately escalating reminder system, delicious data, and our charming community of over-achievers.
And of course getting in shape or getting that book written or whatnot.
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"CARROT1\\"
    href=\\"#CARROT\\"
  >
    [1]
  </a>
</p>
<p>
  So now that all the free money seekers have fled, let&#8217;s dive in with what the Pact diaspora needs to know!
</p>
<h2>
  How Beeminder Works
</h2>
<p>
  Beeminder is different from Pact in the way we structure penalties and goals.
In Beeminder, everything centers on the graph. 
You need to make sure that each day your datapoint is in the safe zone, and not red. 
If you end the day with a red datapoint, that&#8217;s when you&#8217;ll pay money.
</p>
<p>
  The most important things to understand are:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>
      Beeminder never lets you play catch-up.
    </strong>
    If you set up a goal to go the gym 3 times a week, starting on Monday, you can&#8217;t put it off and go to the gym three times on Sunday.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      Beeminder
      <i>
        does
      </i>
      let you get
      <i>
        ahead
      </i>
    </strong>
    and bank your visits for the future. 
So if you know you&#8217;re leaving for a tour of wine country on Thursday, it&#8217;s fine to do your workouts Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      If you fall below the yellow brick road, then Beeminder will charge you your pledged amount,
      <i>
        and increase the pledge
      </i>
    </strong>
    (until you reach your pledge cap). But we don&#8217;t make you catch up from there.
  </li>
</ol>

  If you&#8217;re wanting to move your goals over from Pact into Beeminder, but feeling overwhelmed, we set up a page of

  We totally understand the sentiment we&#8217;ve heard from plenty of Pact users. 
Namely, what&#8217;s the point of this if you can only lose money and never win it?
It&#8217;s like making a bet against yourself at infinitely bad odds!
Which, yes, for a perfectly rational person makes no sense.
And the answer is that Beeminder is not for perfectly rational people.
Beeminder is for sufferers of
  <em>
    akrasia

  .
That&#8217;s the fancy philosophical term, going back to Aristotle, for acting against one&#8217;s own interest.

  Advanced carrotiness: 
If you get really into this and opt for one of our fancier premium plans (which is by no means required) then you can direct half your money to charity, or reject Beeminder&#8217;s stick altogether and cap what you&#8217;re risking at $0.
We should also say explicitly that, those exceptions aside, Beeminder simply keeps the money that you cough up when you go off track on your goals.
We&#8217;ve written extensively about why that isn&#8217;t as

If A
  <em>

  B then A beats or ties B along every possible dimension you could care about. 
Thus no one, no matter how idiosyncratic their preferences, could ever prefer B over A.
</p>
<p>
  For example, I could claim that Ghirardelli chocolate is Pareto-dominated &#8212; there are other brands that are both cheaper and yummier (and have more pronounceable names).
</p>
<p>
  Or this: 
My 30-year-old HP calculator 
(that I carried around everywhere I went as a kid/teenager, like a modern phone) 
is still not Pareto-dominated by what I carry around now: 
sure it&#8217;s like literally a million times less powerful but it had essentially infinite battery life, was indestructible (still works fine!), and never ever crashed. 
And it was Turing-complete, just like what we carry around now.

  A few years ago the political website FiveThirtyEight got some mileage out of this concept for

<h3>
  Pareto Efficiency/Optimality and the Pareto Frontier
</h3>
<p>
  To round this out with some related terms:
Something is Pareto efficient or Pareto optimal if nothing Pareto-dominates it.
</p>
<p>
  Another handy concept is the Pareto frontier, which refers to the set of outcomes (candidates, kinds of chocolate, whatever) that are Pareto efficient.
You can see a simple example in two dimensions in the title image above.
The red points constitute the Pareto frontier and the gray ones are Pareto-dominated.

</p>
<p>
  (None of this is to be confused with the Pareto Principle &#8212; named after the same person &#8212; which is the idea that 80% of the gain comes from 20% of the effort.)
</p>
<h3>
  Pareto-Efficient Software
</h3>
<p>
  In the case of software, the dimensions are the users.
That&#8217;s right, every single user is a dimension.
If there are more than two or three users it&#8217;s pretty hard to draw a visual representation like above but the concept doesn&#8217;t change.
One version of a software product Pareto-dominates another if at least one user strictly prefers it and no user finds it worse.

  Quibble: That assumes a continuum of red points, not just the labeled ones.
Take point N.
Point D is better than N on the y-dimension but worse on the x-dimension.
Similarly, point E is better on the x-dimension but worse on y.
So point N is not in fact Pareto-dominated by any of the labeled red points.

  Notice anything different about the &#8220;Set Up Your Pledge&#8221; screen when creating a new goal? 
(And do you have a very good memory because it&#8217;s now been over a month since we changed this, since we decided we needed a whole blog series before announcing this change?)
For starters there are a bunch of copy tweaks, like retitling the screen to &#8220;Pledge Your Money&#8221;, and referring to &#8220;starting stakes&#8221; and &#8220;pledge cap&#8221;, neither of which were on that screen before:

  You probably don&#8217;t care about the UI-copy but conceivably you care about one small functional difference:

  </a>
  with radio buttons to choose between your default pledge cap (which you can change in your account settings, by the way) and one level higher. 
Like this:

<p>
  How is less choice an improvement? 
Well, I was convinced that people were breezing through goal creation and not being thoughtful about picking a pledge cap. 
Or not understanding what it even meant. 
I think a common newbee reaction was something like:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Um, max pledge? I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on yet so&#8230; the smallest possible one I guess?
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Conveying all the reasons to stick with a high pledge cap &#8212; low starting stakes is of course a-ok &#8212; was not realistic in that interface.
We really want users to not worry their pretty heads about pledge caps at this point.
The standard way for a UI to convey &#8220;you can change this if you really want but if you&#8217;re just breezing through (of course you&#8217;re just breezing through) then just ignore this&#8221; is to
  <a

    title=\\"Inspired by a The Oatmeal comic. To down-pop something means to give it less visual weight.\\"
  >
    down-pop
  </a>
  it.
But, for reasons I&#8217;ll describe shortly, we needed to keep the pledge cap fairly in-your-face.
</p>
<p>
  So we decided to paternalistically impose a high pledge cap.
</p>
<p>
  But not really impose it. 
If you want a lower pledge cap, you can always have it by clicking the dollar amount above your graph 
(or in settings &#8212; we have a separate UI problem that the clickability of things in the graph header is not obvious). 
It&#8217;s not a lot of friction but I think it elegantly ensured that if you&#8217;re picking a lower pledge cap, you&#8217;re doing it intentionally.
</p>
<p>
  And again, you can also set your global default pledge cap in your account settings to further remove friction on goal creation. 
Like if you want to never risk more than $5. 
(And you can still bump pledge caps both up and down any time. 
Only

  can bump up
  <em>
    pledges
  </em>
  , and reducing pledges takes a week to take effect, but anyone can bump pledge
  <em>
    caps
  </em>
  up or down instantly.)
</p>
<p>
  I admit this wasn&#8217;t based on hard data, which is very hard to interpret without proper bucket testing (aka randomized controlled trials) anyway. 
It was mostly based on introspection. 
I, as a user, would find myself breezing through the interface, stepping the pledge cap down to the minimum just because it was easy and I didn&#8217;t want to agonize about how much I should potentially stake on what was often a very experimental goal.
</p>
<h2>
  Just Kidding
</h2>
<p>
  At this point I asked users (via the daily Beemail) what they thought and got brilliant feedback that changed my mind.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;No amount of putting the pledge cap in a flashing huge font would make users pay attention to it. The more you try, the more users tune it out.&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  One bit of feedback I had anticipated was: why bother including a choice of pledge cap at all on that screen? 
If the place to cap pledges is the goal page, fine, but it&#8217;s almost taunting in how little choice it gives you as part of goal creation. 
The answer was that we had another constraint, learned the hard way: 
If you don&#8217;t make the escalating pledges super obvious at goal creation then some users 
(have I mentioned how common it is for users to breeze through interfaces without reading or thinking?) 
would remember clicking $5 but not remember (or have read) any text about the pledge automatically increasing from there.
</p>
<p>

  the pledge cap when creating the goal, you ask? 
Are you even listening to me here? 
Users do not read the words in interfaces! 
No amount of putting the pledge cap in a flashing huge font would make users pay attention to it. 
The more you try, the more users tune it out. 
But these radio buttons for pledge cap, nice and parallel with the starting stakes radio buttons, convey exactly what you&#8217;re getting yourself into in terms of risking your money.
</p>
<p>
  Or so I rationalized.
</p>
<p>
  It turns out it really was too much of a seeming jerk move to give you a scrap of a choice like that. 
And the problem of getting you to actually notice the increasing pledge schedule wasn&#8217;t
  <em>
    that
  </em>
  hard to solve. 
We came up with this:
</p>
<center>
  <img
    title=\\"Penultimate screenshot\\"
    width=\\"185px\\"
    src=\\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/beeminder/original/2X/2/29aad05977b8a6c7b631e58c2f22e43c20e6aa19.png\\"
  >
</center>
<p>
  That seemed to solve the original problem, but it was bugging us that we lost a bit of functionality, namely, full control of your pledge cap directly as part of goal creation.
(And God forbid we make a
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/pareto\\"
    title=\\"The first post in this series\\"
  >
    non-Pareto-dominant change
  </a>
  and have to write a whole blog post about the whole decision process!)
So we decided to update it one more time, like so:
</p>
<center>
  <img
    title=\\"Ultimate screenshot\\"
    width=\\"186px\\"
    src=\\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/beeminder/original/2X/8/8e2e5d6e2098a94de841d7048548664f23cee758.png\\"
  >
</center>
<p>
  The functional difference is that the pledge cap now has a little dropdown arrow and when you click it you get the original stepper back:
</p>
<center>
  <img
    title=\\"Zooming in on the last screenshot\\"
    width=\\"328px\\"

  >
</center>
<p>
  So we&#8217;re pretty sure this
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/pareto\\"
    title=\\"Part 1 of this 3-part blog series\\"
  >
    Pareto dominates
  </a>
  the original version.
Unless you want to quibble about the one additional click, which, given the whole big deal we made out of the
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/pdp\\"
    title=\\"The previous post in this series\\"
  >
    Pareto Dominance Principle
  </a>
  , 
you probably should!
Except now we&#8217;ve blogged about it so our hands are clean.
</p>
<p>
  In any case, I believe we&#8217;ve nicely solved the problem of users breezing through goal creation and picking pledge caps that defeat

    title=\\"See also the idea of finding your Motivation Point\\"
  >
    a lot of the power of Beeminder
  </a>
  .
</p>
<p>
  Now we just have to decide how important it is for the vertically laid-out pledge schedule to dynamically adjust when you change the pledge cap. 
I feel a little silly because this was supposed to be a simple UI tweak with a high bang/buck ratio but, well, fussing begets fussing and here we are.

  Guess what?
This is not actually the most buzzworthy Beeminder-related news right now.
There&#8217;s some even bigger (and entirely unrelated) news that we can&#8217;t share yet.
How&#8217;s that for an infuriatingly vague teaser?
But to hold you over, we thought we&#8217;d let everyone know that as of this week we finally officially support PayPal.
As in, you can now authorize Beeminder to automatically take money from your PayPal account at any point in the future that you may go off track on your goals!

  Getting approved for this and getting it implemented was a mild horror story that we&#8217;ll elide the details of so as not to badmouth the hand that will now be helping feed us.

  And most of the implementation pain was entirely our own fault.
It just involved refactoring and generalizing a bunch of crufty code that assumed that our beloved credit card payment processor,

was the entirety of the financial universe.
</p>
<p>
  To be clear, we&#8217;re not abandoning Stripe, even though PayPal (via its subsidiary, Braintree) can handle credit card processing along with PayPal payments.
In fact, we really want to encourage all our users who have a credit card to use it with Beeminder.
Note our relegation of PayPal to a text link underneath the big black and yellow button for adding a credit card (which continues to be powered by Stripe):

  It&#8217;s funny how divided people are about PayPal.
A lot of you can&#8217;t fathom why anyone would prefer it.
But there are plenty of people, maybe especially in Europe

  , who have made repeated and impassioned pleas that credit cards are not an option for them and we
  <em>

  need to support PayPal.
At some point we heard that enough times to be convinced that we were leaving a big pile of money on the table by not accepting PayPal.
So now we do.

  Ok, I&#8217;ll let Bethany tell you the funny part in a footnote at least:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Even though I think it&#8217;s super clever (and perfectly accurate!) describing the service that Beeminder provides as being
    <em>
      to take your money
    </em>
    , it turns out that&#8217;s not a good pitch to banking types.
    <br>
    &nbsp;
    <br>
    Yes, I actually said that to some corporate salesperson at PayPal who asked about our business model, and it got reported to an insurance underwriter, and then they said &#8220;Uhuh. That sounds too high risk.&#8221;
    <br>
    &nbsp;
    <br>
    I&#8217;ll give you a moment to put your palm to your forehead and shake your head slowly back and forth.
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;
    <br>
    Done?
    <br>
    &nbsp;
    <br>
    So, I called in Danny to put on his CEO voice and try to salvage things. 
We aren&#8217;t a high risk customer, after all. 
We&#8217;ve done over a million dollars of business with Stripe now and haven&#8217;t had a disputed charge in years!
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  The conclusion of all that &#8212; after much headache and heartache and hair-tearing (and even (gasp) phone conversations) &#8212; was that it turned out maybe the only question all along was whether we were too risky to qualify for discounted pricing.
We&#8217;re actually still not really sure and figure we may yet end up getting our account locked, hence the downplaying of the PayPal option in our UI.
(Stripe remains solid as a rock and entirely free of Kafkaesque bureaucracy and is definitely what we recommend any new startup start with.)

<p>
  <a

  </a>
  Here&#8217;s a typical and particularly eloquent pitch from a user for us to add PayPal support:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    I live in Europe, in the Netherlands. 
Here, almost all payments are done without credit cards. 
I have so far avoided needing to sign up for one. 
For the same reasons that I want to use Beeminder, I don&#8217;t want to use a credit card.
They make money on forgetfulness, laziness, and impulses, and I am not confident that I can handle that.
So unless you make PayPal or something like that available, I will not use Beeminder beyond the one free slip-up. 
But I would really like to.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Other arguments against credit cards included security features that block future payments to untrusted merchants, high currency exchange fees, and annual fees.
So, alright, the people have spoken!

<p>
  I have some advice that now feels (to me, subjectively) too obvious to bother to tell you.
But it was once pretty contentious here in the beehive.
So I predict you&#8217;ll either find this obvious or find it obviously wrong.
Are you ready?
</p>
<p>
  The Pareto Dominance Principle (PDP) requires that, when changing the functionality of your product, you can never accept even a small degradation for any (reasonable) user.
The extreme of this is spacebar heating:
</p>
<a href=\\"https://xkcd.com/1172/\\">
  <img
    class=\\"aligncenter\\"
    alt=\\"xkcd #1172: Workflow\\"
    title=\\"There are probably children out there holding down spacebar to stay warm in the winter! YOUR UPDATE MURDERS CHILDREN.\\"
    src=\\"https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/workflow.png\\"
  >
</a>
<p>
  But the principled exception is that you
  <em>
    can
  </em>
  violate Pareto dominance as long as you write a blog post about it.
Like when we
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/deathtofreebees/\\"
    title=\\"Death To Freebees; Or, Freebees Für Alles\\"
  >
    killed freebee goals
  </a>
  or
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/deathtoexp/\\"
    title=\\"Feature Unannouncement: Exponential Roads Going Piecewise Linear\\"
  >
    killed exponential roads
  </a>
  .
</p>
<p>
  The argument against the PDP is that any change that&#8217;s better on net is worth deploying.
Constant, continuous improvement!
And also that you might find yourself at a local maximum, where you have to take a step back to take two steps forward.
</p>
<p>
  I think those arguments are wrong.
Deploying a change that&#8217;s a net improvement but not a Pareto improvement tends to mean tolerating sloppiness, and that can be a slippery slope.
The PDP is a kind of commitment device against sloppiness.
As for the local maxima argument, it&#8217;s so rare in practice that if it does happen, it&#8217;s worth blogging about.
</p>
<p>
  I find that if you keep jumping on seemingly small Pareto improvements it ends up leading to unexpectedly drastic improvements.
Imagine chipping away at bits of cruft here and there and occasionally avalanches of cruft fall away.
Like a user-visible analog of constant
  <a
    href=\\"https://martinfowler.com/bliki/OpportunisticRefactoring.html\\"
    title=\\"Non-programmers probably don&#39;t want to click on this but refactoring code refers to reorganizing it some way to make it clearer\\"
  >
    opportunistic code refactoring
  </a>
  .
Without that discipline, it can be the opposite: new features or improvements having cascades of unintended consequences, agonizing tradeoffs, and technical debt creation.
</p>
<p>
  In short, if you want to make a change that degrades even an obscure use case, or would make a single (reasonable) user even slightly less happy,
maintain the discipline of proving that the change is fully intentional by spelling out and justifying the tradeoff.
(Conversely, probably don&#8217;t add features for obscure use cases or to make single users happy!)
</p>
<p>
  We commonly think in terms of
  <a
    href=\\"http://messymatters.com/uvi/\\"
    title=\\"Blog post (originally on the Beeminder blog but this one is the most up to date) about Beeminder&#39;s $1000 commitment device for making a user-visible improvement to Beeminder every dang day for years and years now\\"

    User-Visible Improvements
  </a>
  (UVIs) here at the beehive so here&#8217;s perhaps the pithiest possible version of the Pareto Dominance Principle:
  <strong>
    Negative UVIs verboten!
  </strong>
  Or less esoterically:
  <strong>
    Zero tolerance on regressions!
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  We haven&#8217;t always followed this religiously in the past but now that we&#8217;ve written this blog post, we&#8217;re on the hook.
</p>
<h3>
  Caveats and Fine Print
</h3>
<p>
  Thanks to the daily beemail subscribers who vetted this!
Here are some exceptions and clarifications you all helped us come up with:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Conceivably we&#8217;ll someday need to make a Pareto dominated security fix.
And less conceivably but still conceivably it would be something that&#8217;s a bad idea to discuss publicly.
Typically it&#8217;s good to blog about the security fix after it&#8217;s fixed. 
But just in case, we&#8217;ll stake out security fixes as an exception.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Hopefully this isn&#8217;t too weaselly but we have the &#8220;reasonable user&#8221; clause as a kind of get-out-of-jail-free card. 
For example, if we didn&#8217;t have the previous caveat and had to do something for security reasons then a reasonable user can&#8217;t reasonably object.
Or imagine a blatant bug that turns out to benefit some user in some way (like the spacebar heating in the xkcd comic).
Being a blatant bug, a reasonable user can&#8217;t object to fixing it.
They&#8217;d just have to make a feature request for addressing their use case in a non-buggy way!
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The PDP is a constraint on what we knowingly deploy.
We accidentally introduce bugs all(llll) the time and that doesn&#8217;t violate the PDP.
Fixing regressions is always higher priority but the PDP doesn&#8217;t impose any particular commitment there either.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>

  Rather, this is about beeminding the building of Beeminder, which means showing you graphs of things like the 7000 person-hours we&#8217;ve spent working on this.

  &#8220;Bethany concocted what she dubbed the Voluntary Harassment Program to keep me churning out chapters.&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  Right, so the self-quantifying journey that is Beeminder begins in 2005 when I was scrambling to get my PhD thesis written and Bethany, who I had recently met and, obviously, fallen head-over-heels for, concocted what she dubbed the Voluntary Harassment Program to keep me churning out chapters.
That was a smashing success and we continued to experiment on ourselves with crazy incentive schemes and productivity hacks until 2008 when we started getting friends and family in on the fun, with what we called
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/beenamer\\">
    Kibotzer
  </a>
  &#8212; the kibitzing robot &#8212; which was an early incarnation of Beeminder, and the point where those 7000 person-hours started.
</p>
<p>
  We had read a Paul Graham essay about startups called &#8220;
  <a href=\\"http://www.paulgraham.com/die.html\\">
    How Not to Die
  </a>
  &#8221; in which he suggests that if you could just fully commit yourself to not giving up, your chances of success would be 90%, which he emphasizes he&#8217;s being perfectly serious about.

<p>
  So we were like &#8220;We have an app for that!&#8221;.
And we started tracking our time &#8212; which we had written a nifty time tracker for called
  <a href=\\"http://messymatters.com/tagtime\\">
    TagTime
  </a>
  , which this is also not a pitch for 
(in fact it&#8217;s not exactly user friendly &#8212; it requires cloning a git repository and working knowledge of vim) &#8212; but it is super awesome and integrates with Beeminder and these graphs were generated automatically from that data.

  We got up to 2000 person-hours or so and we still weren&#8217;t publicly launched, our beta users couldn&#8217;t create new goals without going through an admin interface, and it was seriously tempting to throw in the towel and get a real job.
The only interesting thing we learned was that 40 hours of work per week is damn hard when you&#8217;re only counting actual work. 
We were also reminded of the adage &#8220;You make what you measure&#8221;.

  &#8220;We committed to averaging one User-Visible Improvement to Beeminder per day.&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  So we decided to commit ourselves to
  <em>
    visible
  </em>
  inexorable forward progress.
In February of 2011 we committed to averaging one User-Visible Improvement  to Beeminder per day.
(We made that public in a
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/blogdog\\">
    blog post
  </a>
  a couple months later.)
We call them UVIs.
If we failed &#8212; if we were ever off-track as measured by our
  <a href=\\"http://beeminder.com/meta/uvi\\">
    meta Beeminder road
  </a>
  &#8212; we&#8217;d pay a user [Dr Evil pose] $1000.
</p>
<p>
  I actually pushed back hard about this when Danny first suggested it. 
It was a scary prospect, and seemed like it was potentially problematic.
What about refactoring (not user visible), writing tests (not user visible)?
What if I needed to work on some bigger feature that couldn&#8217;t be rolled out in bits and pieces?

  &#8220;The UVI road may have literally saved Beeminder&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  So how did this new focus change things? How has it affected Beeminder&#8217;s growth? 
First, there&#8217;s more than one time when the UVI road may have literally saved Beeminder. 
In May of 2011 we had a huge family reunion (on a boat). 
It was nearly three weeks of travel, and we built up a huge safety buffer of UVIs to get us through.

<p>
  But you know how it is after a family vacation. You need a vacation from your vacation. 
And when your job is coding, it&#8217;s even harder to get back to work after three weeks away &#8212; you have to load all that code back into your head. 
We actually had a UVI due on one of the first couple days back. We had to get to work (to the tune of $1000).
</p>
<p>
  We realize this is not a direct correlation with success, but we think there are a lot of positive ways it has shaped us as we&#8217;ve grown. 
Our company has become one where the focus is on making our users happier every single day (on average!). 
Our customers are really ecstatic about that. 
Which makes them
  <a href=\\"http://beeminder.com/testimonials\\">
    shockingly happy
  </a>
  to pay us when they go off track.
Of course, we track

    a lot more than just UVIs and time

<p>
  People often complain about Beeminder&#8217;s perverse incentives. 
We started to address that at the end of
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/gympact\\">
    our recent blog post comparing ourselves to GymPact
  </a>
  :
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    It seems that from the perspective of those paying us, Beeminder is providing a ton of value and a ton of motivation
and the occasional cost of derailment is a fair fee for Beeminder’s service. 
In that sense it’s almost natural that the fee is waived for people who never go off track. 
Those people evidently didn’t really need Beeminder in the first place.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  In other words, Beeminder is putting itself on the map for exactly one reason: it makes people more awesome.
</p>
<p>
  But that can lead to the opposite complaint &#8212; that Beeminder&#8217;s sting is so valuable as to be self-defeating. 
In other words, it&#8217;s hard to be motivated by the threat of having to pay Beeminder if you feel that Beeminder has already earned that money! 
Please don&#8217;t laugh but we&#8217;d like to propose that the solution is to just hurry and get to an obscene pledge amount. 
After the $5 and $10 pledges it gets obscene quite quickly: $30, $90, $270&#8230;
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;We need to get up to crazier pledges before they’re motivating.&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  We ourselves have the problem of reduced sting even moreso: 
for
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/blogdog\\">
    some of our goals we pay our users
  </a>
  and for others we&#8217;re just paying ourselves (minus credit card processing fees and other overhead). 
But it just means that we need to get up to crazier pledges before they&#8217;re motivating. 
The $90 Bethany and I both have on
  <a href=\\"http://bmndr.com/d/meta\\">
    bmndr.com/d/meta
  </a>
  and
  <a href=\\"http://bmndr.com/b/meta\\">
    bmndr.com/b/meta
  </a>
  is maybe/sorta sufficiently motivating but we tend to skate the edge and it&#8217;s probably a matter of time before something comes up and makes us derail. 
(Tip: Keep an eye on

  </a>
  for your chance to win!
UPDATE: We&#8217;ve each paid out the $90 in the meantime and are currently each at $270 at risk.) 
I have $810 pledged on
  <a href=\\"http://bmndr.com/d/ontask\\">
    bmndr.com/d/ontask
  </a>
  but that was frightening enough that I made the road super conservative. 
But I think that still works. 
If I get annoyed with myself for not being on task enough then I&#8217;ll dial up that road despite the frighteningly high cost of failure.

  When I first introduce people to Beeminder, they either recoil in horror or they want to dive right in.
But the easiest way to defeat a new system is to overload it

  , so if you read this blog post and then immediately create a bunch of goals, I&#8217;ve probably failed.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;The easiest way to defeat a new system is to overload it&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  There are two obvious ways to overload a system:
  <strong>
    volume
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
    intensity
  </strong>
  .
In Beeminder terms, volume is creating more goals than you&#8217;re able to keep current, and intensity is setting too aggressive a slope.
</p>
<p>
  You might
  <em>
    want
  </em>
  to lose 20 pounds by next month, but the behaviour change would almost certainly be too extreme to sustain over time.
You&#8217;ll be better off creating easier goals, things that help get you moving in the right direction.
There will be plenty of time and techniques for making your goals more aggressive.

something that I actually want to achieve or become.
That&#8217;s important to remember &#8212; there is something real behind the measurements and the graphs.

  conference this year, so maybe I should confess that I&#8217;m pretty much a non-quantified person.
I have a deep suspicion that the things that are easily measured are not the most important things to focus on.
</p>
<p>
  I also don&#8217;t want to become an obsessive measurer.
Sure, I have weight and fitness goals, but if meeting those means that I have to become an obsessive calorie-counting machine, I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s worth it.
That degree of quantification is not part of my vision.
I&#8217;d much rather become the kind of person who naturally wants to eat better and exercise more, in a sustainable lifelong way.
</p>
<p>
  Beeminder is just a tool that I can use to help.
It&#8217;s one of the most powerful tools in my productivity arsenal, and it&#8217;ll stay that way if I can keep myself from

  Outcomes vs Activities
</h2>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;Weight is an outcome &#8212; it&#8217;s the result of eating better and exercising more&#8221;

<p>
  Beeminder goals naturally tend to be activities: things you can actively do, or not do.

  </a>
  that completely changed my thinking. 
The essence is this: your weight is an outcome, it&#8217;s the result of eating better and exercising more &#8212; activities!
</p>
<p>
  For weight loss, I&#8217;ve always had Beeminder goals for both of these things.
A nice gentle downward slope to keep my weight moving in the right direction, and more aggressively tracked activities.

  </a>
</p>
<p>
  What I hadn&#8217;t done was notice that some of my other goals were actually outcomes, not activities.
No wonder I had trouble staying on those roads!
</p>
<p>
  One reason that outcomes are hard to beemind aggressively is that they&#8217;re often less predictable.
You only discover that you&#8217;re on a weight beemergency day when you stand on the scale in the morning.
But you can see your go-to-the-gym activity goal beemergency approaching and plan for it.

Ideally these outcomes are supported by more specific activity-based goals.

  <li>
    <p>
      I even have
      <em>

      </em>
      .
If you&#8217;re anything like me, you avoid doing stuff even when it&#8217;s a beemergency day.
That can make for some very late nights, and for anti-social evenings.
So I have a goal that encourages me to deal with my beemergencies earlier in the day.
    </p>

</ol>
<p>
  I haven&#8217;t mentioned weight or health or fitness.
That&#8217;s because for me, my weight goal is an outcome, and the FitBit and RunKeeper and

    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/gym/\\"
    title=\\"Ancient Beeminder blog post by Jill Renaud\\"

  goals are all activities that support it.
So too is the eating better goal.
</p>
<p>
  Right now I have 27 active goals, and I&#8217;m thinking of adding a couple more.
This is not as insane as it sounds, though I don&#8217;t recommend it to anyone who hasn&#8217;t been beeminding for at least half a year.
</p>
<h2>
  Dealing with Volume
</h2>
<p>
  Updating that many goals could be a nightmare, and sometimes they conspire to come to a beemergency day all at once.

  For you, I did a count:
</p>
<p>
  I have 8 goals that get updated most days, 4 that get updated every few days, 9 weekly, and 4 monthly.
That sounds like a lot of updating, but we have a secret weapon:
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/glossary#autodata\\"
    title=\\"An autodata goal is one that has an automatic data source, like RescueTime or Trello or Fitbit or RunKeeper. You authorize Beeminder to read your data from one of those sources and then your Beeminder graph updates automatically. The full list of autodata sources is on the Beeminder front page.\\"
  >
    autodata
  </a>
  .
</p>
<p>
  3/4 of my daily goals and 1/2 of my weekly goals are automatically updated.
I stand on my
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/withings\\"
    title=\\"This is the link to set up an automatic Withings weight goal\\"
  >
    Withings scale
  </a>
  and my weight outcome goal gets updated.
I go for a run and my Runkeeper goal gets updated.
Easy.
</p>
<p>
  In contrast, my monthly goals all rely on manual data entry.
But that&#8217;s ok, because by definition once-a-month goals don&#8217;t need updating very often.
The more often something needs to be updated, the more you should try to find a way to tie doing-the-activity directly to updating-the-graph.

  , and it seems that on average I manually update 4 goals each day.
Those 4 updates per day are enough to keep 27 goals ticking over.

<p>
  The other way that I cope with volume is by reducing the slope of my roads.
Because I can&#8217;t handle non-stop beemergency days, and because priorities change.

<p>
  The biggest problem with beeminding something leniently is that it&#8217;s easy to build up a huge safety buffer.
Any time that I have too much of a buffer, I inevitably fall off the road when the safe days run out.

  Auto-ratchet means that no matter how much I do in a given week, my yellow brick road won&#8217;t let me have more than so-many-days of safety buffer.
For me this is an ideal situation, because it sets a minimum frequency on the goal.

  Beeminder is a powerful tool and, like all productivity hacks, works best if you surrender the right amount of agency to the system.
Overload it or ignore it, and the tool stops working.
This is a marathon, not a sprint.

      is pretty resilient, but at this stage you aren&#8217;t. 
So build up the list gradually. 
My advice is to start off with the tasks and projects that are of immediate concern to you right now, and then add more as they come up in the natural course of things.

    If you&#8217;ve joined Beeminder with a goal of losing weight, I&#8217;d encourage you to add two more: a goal of exercising more, and a goal of eating better.
You don&#8217;t need to be specific: I have a &#8220;daily sweat&#8221; goal that gets a point every time I do something, anything from doing pilates, going to the gym, taking a long walk, dancing, or teaching a flying trapeze class.
It&#8217;s all good.

That&#8217;s a whole other blog post, but the answer should be obvious.
Beeminder makes a great meta tool, to make sure that you&#8217;re doing your weekly reviews, processing your inboxes, and even checking off tasks.
But it&#8217;s a lousy place to remember specific non-recurring tasks.

    I&#8217;m so against building up a safety buffer that nearly all of my goals are set to &#8220;no mercy&#8221; so that I don&#8217;t get a week of flatness when I derail.
But sometimes life conspires to make that too hard, and I&#8217;d really like to have had a flat week before the slope resumes.
My fine print for all of those goals says that I can claim a flat spot after any derailment.
I&#8217;ve never yet invoked the clause, but I&#8217;m not sure that I would be brave enough to tick the &#8220;no mercy&#8221; box without putting the caveat in place.

    Though for most purposes, top marathoners are running at a sprint.
In 2011, the London Marathon record was established at a pace of 17.75 seconds per hundred metres.
It&#8217;s a 2-hours-long sprint that most people would struggle to keep pace with on a bicycle.
Their times for a full marathon would be a decent amateur time for a half marathon.
Can you tell that I&#8217;m in awe?

It means you quickly reach a pledge that&#8217;s highly motivating and keeps you on track for a long time. 
But one more exponential step beyond &#8220;highly motivating&#8221; was often &#8220;OMG too scary I quit&#8221;.
</p>
<p>
  That outcome is not good for us nor you. 
So now you can set a pledge cap for each goal! 
You could do this before by unchecking the &#8220;auto-increase pledges&#8221; checkbox when you reached the right pledge, but that required too much vigilance.
Now you can directly choose, in the goal settings, any of the possible pledges as a pledge cap:

    Each time you derail the pledge amount automatically increases, but only up to this amount. 
Set it to something scary enough that you&#8217;re motivated to never let it actually get that high!

Then you&#8217;ll see something like this:

</p>
<p>
  As the hovertext explains, you have to first drop the current pledge down to select a lower pledge cap.
[UPDATE: We removed that restriction. 
You can set a pledge cap lower than your current pledge.
It just means the lower pledge cap won&#8217;t take effect until/unless you actually drop the pledge down.
A warning appears if you try to do that that should make it self-explanatory.]

  But not so scary that you&#8217;d rather quit Beeminder than have that amount at risk.

  fans in Beeminderland.
Me personally included.
I find it a powerful anti-procrastination strategy to save an article to Pocket when it threatens to suck me in during the workday.
</p>
<p>
  But that strategy really depends on my having some confidence that saving to Pocket isn&#8217;t tantamount to throwing it into a black hole.
If you add things to your Pocket queue faster than you read them, then that&#8217;s certainly what you&#8217;re doing.
We&#8217;ve written pretty extensively about this kind of

  </a>
  .
</p>
<p>
  Point being, to feel good about saving something to Pocket and getting on with your work, you need to commit to actually keeping up with your Pocket queue.
Which is to say, you need Beeminder.
</p>
<p>
  And our Pocket integration now lets you beemind your Pocket queue automatically.
It&#8217;s so slick!
</p>
<p>
  The entire instructions are are just, fill out this form to decide how many articles a week (or day or month) to commit to reading:
</p>

  >
</p>
<p>
  From then on, no interaction with Beeminder is needed.
Just archive articles in Pocket; Beeminder will magically notice and add datapoints to your graph.

  You can adjust how much you&#8217;re committed to (how steep the bright red line on your graph is) at any time, but changes take a week to go into effect so you can&#8217;t just flatten your commitment because you &#8220;got busy today&#8221;.

  flatten with a week&#8217;s notice, like to schedule a break, or to archive the goal altogether.
</p>
<p>
  I recommend adjusting the slope control-systems-style: make it a bit steeper if you&#8217;re still saving articles faster than you&#8217;re reading them and make it a bit shallower if you actually find yourself close to emptying your Pocket queue altogether.

  PS: It&#8217;s specifically hitting archive on a Pocket article that automatically sends the +1 to Beeminder.
Deleting an article doesn&#8217;t give you a point.
And if you archive and then unarchive an article, you still get the +1 (don&#8217;t do that!), but we do remember which things you archived so you don&#8217;t get a second +1 for re-archiving it.

  A question that we&#8217;re relegating to a footnote for now: Is it cheating to archive something without reading it?
Our answer is no!
Admitting you&#8217;re not going to read something counts as dispatching it from your to-read queue.
I personally have a hard time with this and typically feel compelled to read something before counting it as dispatched.
But I don&#8217;t endorse that.
I think I feel compelled to read or mostly read something before archiving it because if I just archive it, it&#8217;s tempting to be like
&#8220;I can still go find this on the internet again and read it after all!&#8221;
Which should be considered filthy, filthy cheating.
(Thanks to Lanthala and Shawn Koh for these insights.)
</p>
<p>
  Deciding to archive something is highly valuable for your reading goal because you&#8217;re consciously doing the triage.
You&#8217;re saying &#8220;I have to get rid of something; all
  <em>
    these
  </em>
  somethings I&#8217;m not willing to get rid of, so I&#8217;ll get rid of

Without doing that you have no hope of reading the other somethings because they&#8217;re buried in a

as discussed last time, and certainly includes Pomodoro Poker.
</p>
<p>
  So what is Pomodoro Poker?
Well, for the last three years (ever since we
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/beehive\\"
    title=\\"&#39;Beeminder Hits the Oregon Trail&#39;\\"
  >
    moved to Portland
  </a>
  )
we&#8217;ve hosted a weekly hack night at the beehive where we invite our friends to come over and then sit quietly and not pay any attention to each other.
It&#8217;s generally the most productive night of the week. 
Here are the rules:
</p>
<ol start=\\"0\\">
  <li>
    Everyone antes a dollar
  </li>
  <li>
    We each write down a task on the whiteboard
  </li>
  <li>
    Start a 45-minute timer
  </li>
  <li>
    Cross off your task as soon as it&#8217;s done
  </li>
  <li>
    The
    <i>
      last
    </i>
    person done (without going over, price-is-right style) wins the pot
  </li>
  <li>
    Repeat every hour
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  If no one finishes in time (which is common) the money rolls over to the next round.
And we do get to socialize during the 15 minute breaks.
</p>
<p>
  Why does the last person done win all the money, instead of the first?
The idea is to train ourselves to estimate how long tasks take, to learn to define tasks that can actually be done in 45 minutes of focused work.
</p>
<p>
  The game theorists in the audience are now wondering why you wouldn&#8217;t pick a trivial task and drag your feet on it for 44 minutes and 59 seconds and then come in under the wire.
It&#8217;s called honor, game theorists.
Or pride.
The tasks are public, and the whole point is to increase productivity.
If you pick something over-ambitious and then work like mad futilely trying to finish in time, well, that&#8217;s easily worth the dollar!
But as long as you&#8217;re not sandbagging, it&#8217;s fair game to pick a task that you&#8217;re certain you&#8217;ll finish in way less than 45 minutes, in hopes that you&#8217;ll be the only one to finish at all.

  The Robustness Principle, also known as Postel&#8217;s Law, says to be conservative in what you send and liberal in what you accept. 
I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m alone in opining that that principle makes web development a Lovecraftian nightmare.

  What you should actually do is fail hard and loud and consistently and make everyone get with the program.
Everyone (or thing) interacting with your program, I mean.

  Code-philosophically, when a program gets input that&#8217;s slightly wrong but it&#8217;s easy to convert it to what you know the input was meant to be, it&#8217;s a Very Bad Idea to actually do that. 
Instead you should say &#8220;that input is Not Exactly Right so everything will break now&#8221;. 
It sounds crazy but is so, so true! 
Being forgiving leads to cruft and technical debt and baffling future bugs.

He&#8217;s amazing.
Anyway, we were chatting with him about the Anti-Robustness Principle and he had an especially good example that he said we could share so we&#8217;re including it in this aside.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
    It started with yet another example of our own, about Ruby and our database being way too permissive 
(&#8220;you can&#8217;t assign an array to a float so we&#8217;ll just assume you want that float to be zero ok done&#8221;)
and causing us all manner of heartache.
Prof Yorgey is a serious Haskell expert, a language with static typing that prevents just such heartache.
So we sheepishly pointed him to this example of how we&#8217;d reaped what we&#8217;d sown in not using Haskell.
Here was his response:
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      The thing is, Haskell is way overkill for this.
Even Java or C++ will prevent you from initializing a numeric variable with an array!
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
    I should interject in Ruby&#8217;s defense that Ruby itself is not that idiotic either.
Our problem involved the combination of Ruby and our database (Mongo).
In any case, it was a seriously facepalmy violation of the Anti-Robustness Principle!
But getting back to Prof. Yorgey:
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      I have no problem with dynamic typing per se.
It&#8217;s this whole idea of refusing to throw type errors
      <em>
        even at runtime
      </em>
      that I don&#8217;t get.
      <br>
      &#8220;I know, when the types of things don&#8217;t match, let&#8217;s have the runtime just silently convert to some default value, because it will be sooooo cute and convenient to be able to write things like
      <code>
        while queue
      </code>
      instead of
      <code>
        while !queue.isEmpty
      </code>
      and there&#8217;s definitely no way this will ever come back to blow off everyone&#8217;s feet!&#8221;  When I&#8217;m teaching Python my students are constantly making mistakes like writing
      <code>
        if blah == \\"y\\" or \\"Y\\"
      </code>
      and are then mystified when that branch always runs no matter what they type.  It makes me so angry when I have to explain how the string &#8220;Y&#8221; is getting silently converted to True.

  Here&#8217;s a specific way we ourselves have violated this principle:
The Beeminder API, if it gets a parameter it doesn&#8217;t recognize, silently ignores it.
Anguished wail!
That just means if you misspell something then everything will appear to be fine and later it will turn out to be mystifyingly not fine and unless you get lucky and spot the mistake you may end up heaving your computer out the window and that is expensive.
It actually seems absurd to me that we didn&#8217;t know that
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/api\\"
    title=\\"Announcement of the Beeminder API\\"
  >
    back in 2012
  </a>
  , 
but here we are.
</p>
<p>
  Can&#8217;t we just fix it, you ask?
Maybe not!
And this is the real kicker with how awful the Robustness Principle is.
Or how vital the Anti-Robustness Principle is.
Since the Beeminder API is all nice and forgiving about unknown parameters, who knows which clients 
(including our own smartphone apps, though we could fix those ourselves, obviously) 
will break if we suddenly stop being misguidedly robust.
</p>
<p>
  If you do the persnickety thing you can always change your mind later and be more forgiving. 
It&#8217;s much harder to go the other direction.
Hence Anti-Robustness being an important guiding principle for writing code and us consecrating it as a blog post in hopes that we&#8217;ll be better about this ourselves.

  Repetitio est mater stagni

<p>
  Learning a skill should be easy:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    identify what you want to learn
  </li>
  <li>
    choose an exercise to practice it
  </li>
  <li>
    repeat ad infinitum
  </li>
  <li>
    ???
  </li>
  <li>
    profit.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  This is the exact approach a lot of us take when deciding to learn to play a musical instrument, get better at a sport, become efficient in our chosen profession, or even just type faster &#8212; if we keep doing it, we&#8217;ll get better at it.
</p>
<p>
  What I can tell you is that you&#8217;re less right than you would want to be, and that what you&#8217;re doing to improve yourself right now might be perfectly useless.
</p>
<h2>
  Defining practice
</h2>
<p>
  The common scientific approach to practice assumes four components to make it work, and all of these components are crucial.
</p>
<h4>
  1. The motivation to get off your ass and work on it.
</h4>
<p>
  Don&#8217;t have enough motivation to work on something? 
Well, you probably won&#8217;t, then. 
(Statistically, the people who improve at a skill are those who explicitly plan to practice!) 
The beautiful thing about the motivation to practice is that it forms a positive feedback loop &#8212; the more you practice, the better you get, and the happier it makes you to keep at it. 
Many studies have shown that even after a person has performed some task many times, and considers themselves to do it as well as they ever could, monetary incentives can push them to find new methods of performing the task, which leads to great improvements in speed and accuracy!
This has been shown to apply in

    title=\\"The Role of Deliberate Practice in the Acquisition of Expert Performance\\"

    areas from typing speed to marathon running
  </a>
  .
(And, as we know,
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/punishment\\"
    title=\\"Previous Beeminder guest post about negative reinforcement vs punishment, if you want to get technical (you&#39;re reading the Beeminder blog so probably you want to get technical)\\"
  >
    negative reinforcement
  </a>
  works even better than positive, as long as you&#8217;re the type of person to talk yourself into a commitment contract&#8230;)
</p>
<h4>
  2. The way the task builds onto your preexisting knowledge.
</h4>
<p>
  Can you figure out, within a short learning period,
  <em>
    how
  </em>
  exactly you need to perform the task to succeed in it, based on your previous competencies? 
If you can&#8217;t, chances are the practice will be a waste &#8212; or even detrimental to your progress. 
But you don&#8217;t want to spend most of your time thinking about doing something instead of doing it, do you?
This point relies heavily on how well you plan for your task and the resources you have available. 
In short, adequate research and preparation are crucial for your success.
</p>
<h4>
  3. The immediate informative feedback on the success of your practice.
</h4>
<p>
  Now comes the good part.
Without knowing how you&#8217;re doing, where you&#8217;re failing, what you need to improve and how, chances are your practice regimen will (all else equal) help you improve at a certain aspect of your chosen skill, and that will be it. 
Your progress will stagnate and you will &#8212; dejectedly &#8212; conclude that this is the best that you can ever get at it. 
It&#8217;s likely that your motivation will start to drop, too. 
Thus, instances of scheduled reevaluation of your methods and approaches are absolutely necessary to even keep you on track.

    title=\\"A Factorial Study of Tutoring Versus Classroom Instruction\\"
  >
    studies
  </a>
  have shown that there is an overwhelming difference in the success of skill acquisition in students who have received some private tutoring, compared to those in a standard classroom environment, in self-teaching groups, or those learning from distributed material. 
You yourself are unlikely to be able to gauge how well you&#8217;re doing at a skill you&#8217;re just developing, or even how you can monitor for it &#8212; and coming to the wrong conclusion can completely derail your progress (think of wrongly learned behavioral patterns or sports injuries, for example).
If you
  <em>
    really
  </em>
  want to get good at something without wasting your time and effort, you&#8217;d do well to find an experienced mentor or tutor to judge your success and guide your hand.
</p>
<h4>
  4. Repetition.
</h4>
<p>
  &#8230;or, via the Law of Superiority from the always-relevant Murphy&#8217;s Law:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    The first example of superior principle is always inferior to the developed example of inferior principle.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Repetition without adjusting for your progress won&#8217;t get you anywhere, but giving up before trying won&#8217;t get you far either.

    The Role of Deliberate Practice in the Acquisition of Expert Performance
  </a>
  from the early 90s (which is a beautiful, palatable read that I thoroughly recommend), deliberate practice has been understood to stand for engaging in activities that have been specifically designed to improve your current level of performance. 
It&#8217;s supposed to require your full focus and it&#8217;s not supposed to be inherently enjoyable.
You can ask yourself two simple questions about what you practice:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    If you don&#8217;t have to focus on it, are you really improving at it?
  </li>
  <li>
    If you enjoy it, are you really facing your shortcomings?

    are
  </em>
  mostly out of our hands. 
The recent research into the genetic predispositions for excellence at certain tasks shows that, for some of us &#8212; even though they can be learned, to some extent &#8212; abilities such as having perfect pitch just come naturally.
</p>
<p>
  It&#8217;s easy to see (in most cases, barring some athletic disciplines with obvious, objective prerequisites) that some of us might get an easier start when it comes to a certain skill, but if you&#8217;re looking to become an expert at it and spend a decade or more perfecting your performance, the strongest factor determining your success will be practice. 
Not just how much you practice, but
  <em>
    how
  </em>
  you practice. 
Motivating yourself, knowing what you&#8217;re doing, pushing yourself out of your comfort zones, and working at it diligently for long enough, often enough, without stopping the search for a better approach &#8212; that&#8217;s how you become an expert.

You wouldn&#8217;t say that multilingual children have a genetic advantage to reach fluency in more than one language, but as an adult, you&#8217;d struggle quite a bit to reach their level of fluency. 
This is simply due to the brain changes that occur in

The way you approach a task gets vastly different as you get better at it, and you get to see it in a new light as your procedural memory takes care of the basics and you get to focus on the good stuff.

<p>
  But to get good at it, you&#8217;ll need to practice.

      Finding sufficient motivation to create a practice regimen is as simple as jotting down a Beeminder goal.

I got my hands on one after graduation, but found very quickly that I could never manage a steady period of regular practice. 
It was a source of personal embarrassment and &#8216;maybe-one-day&#8217;s. 
In September last year (on the day I stumbled straight through the looking glass) I told myself that I will be learning to play the

Having completed a degree in music theory, I concluded that I&#8217;m perfectly capable of focusing mainly on the playing aspect when it came to getting better at this awesome instrument. 
In the first few weeks of going back to the basics, I did my research, got my hands on good books with both exercises and theory, bought a sheet music stand, and planned out my route through the materials. 
I decided to master technical exercises one at a time (keeping track of the effort, not the results!), and supplement my practice with reading.

      Sticking to a game plan without reevaluating your goals doesn&#8217;t get you far.
Any language learner can already nod at this. 
As a simple example, if you start learning a new language through Duolingo, you&#8217;ll make great progess for a while. 
But constantly practicing a language on a tree you&#8217;ve already mastered gives you diminishing returns.

  For me, I check my basic playing technique once a week. 
And last week, in a fated moment of clarity, I realized I&#8217;m just as unable to guide myself through the process of successfully acquiring a new skill as anyone else. 
My bow hold, the thing I thought I knew by heart how to do right &#8212; isn&#8217;t. 
With the correct bow hold, only a few hours of practice made a big difference. 
I would have done so much better for myself had I had an expert tell me what I&#8217;m doing wrong and how to fix it.

  A fun fact about predicting your own behavior, particularly publicly, is that the act of predicting it changes the prediction.
&#8220;I&#8217;m 75% likely to maintain my Duolingo streak all year, but now that I&#8217;ve said so I&#8217;m actually 90% likely, but now that I&#8217;ve said

Or what happens when the probability starts very low but you add a wager?
It&#8217;s like this self-describing xkcd:

  (This, incidentally, is part of what&#8217;s hard about predicting whether superhuman AI will accidentally destroy everything humans value in the universe.
If we actually had consensus on the probability being high, we&#8217;d be galvanized to change course.
It&#8217;s like if you knew you had a high chance of accidentally taking a fatal dose of medicine, you&#8217;d double check the dosage and make the probability low again.
Not that I&#8217;m arguing against sounding alarm bells.)

    title=\\"The story of Beeminder&#39;s past and current name\\"

    Bethany tell the story
  </a>
  in an ancient Quantified Self talk from when Beeminder was a side project.
Back then, instead of automatically paying Beeminder when you went off track, Beeminder just showed you a graph of your progress and your commitment.
The commitment contracts themselves were arranged separately.
The inaugural commitment contracts were Bethany and me staking $2,000 each on a gallery of personal fitness and productivity goals during the summer of 2010:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Steps
  </li>
  <li>
    Weight
  </li>
  <li>
    Work hours on our day jobs
  </li>
  <li>
    Time spent with our kids (still babies back then! and, weirdly, this was a do-less goal for me)
  </li>
  <li>
    Time spent building our fun new self-tracking commitment device app
  </li>
  <li>
    Pushups
  </li>
  <li>
    Desserts
  </li>
  <li>
    Reading fiction
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  So what did &#8220;staking $2,000&#8221; mean?
We were each promising to pay some friend or family member that $2k if we didn&#8217;t stay on track on all of those goals.
Which friend or family member was determined by auction, coordinated manually by email at first.
We started the bidding at $10, it quickly went to $50, and then we sold them for $65 each the next day.
</p>
<p>
  That meant that our friends were paying $65 for the chance to win $2k.
Which implies market odds of 96.8% that we&#8217;d succeed at our goals that summer.
Which we did, phew.
Obviously the probability would not have been nearly so high without the money at stake.
</p>
<p>
  Emboldened by that trial, we set up a slightly more formal auction interface for other people to use:
</p>
<p>
  <img
    class=\\"aligncenter\\"
    alt=\\"Screenshot of the auction results for Melanie's weight loss commitment contract\\"
    title=\\"Screenshot of the auction results for Melanie's weight loss commitment contract\\"

  >
</p>
<p>
  That one turns the game theory up to eleven.
The commitment contract there was my sister Melanie&#8217;s weight loss goal, with $600 of her money at stake.
The bidders specify in the first row of that table the most they&#8217;d pay to be the beneficiary of the commitment contract.
The auction mechanism then does a bunch of math
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"MATH1\\"
    href=\\"#MATH\\"
  >
    [2]
  </a>
  to decide how much people actually pay (second row) and to divvy the potential booty (third row).
As it turned out Laurie, our mother, got half the contract &#8212; half of Melanie&#8217;s $600 should she have failed at her goal.

    Melanie
  </a>
  did in fact stay on track so those shares didn&#8217;t end up paying out.
Each person&#8217;s bid implies the odds they assign to Melanie actually staying on track on her weight goal.
The bottom right number &#8212; 2.5% &#8212; is the aggregated market odds.
</p>
<p>
  Today, Beeminder only offers infinitely bad odds.
You pay for going off track, but don&#8217;t get paid for staying on track.
You could think of that as perfectly fair odds if using Beeminder meant a 100% chance of always staying on track.
It doesn&#8217;t but these days we view this all very differently, largely because staying on vs going off track is not actually a binary outcome.
You&#8217;ll inevitably go off track
  <em>
    sometimes

  and that&#8217;s fine &#8212; you&#8217;re really just paying for the motivation Beeminder is providing the rest of the time.

    href=\\"https://doc.beeminder.com/bidder\\"
    title=\\"The First Auctioned-off Beeminder Commitment Contract\\"
  >
    ancient document
  </a>
  about it.
If I had to justify it, it started with the idea to let everyone buy in at any amount of money they chose.
Call that the pot.
Then you divvy up shares of the contract 
(the money you win if the person auctioning off the commitment contract doesn&#8217;t do what they committed to)
by just giving each person a fraction of the contract equal to the fraction they contributed to the pot.
The more you put in, the more of the payout you get (if the contract pays out).
It&#8217;s like a parimutuel market.
</p>
<p>
  But then!
This is where the wild game theory comes in.
Deciding how much to pay into the pot is a tricky strategic problem that depends pretty delicately on what other people are paying in.
</p>
<p>
  Say two other bidders have put in $100 each on a $1000 contract.
And let&#8217;s say the person creating this commitment contract is doomed, as in, you&#8217;re 100% certain they&#8217;ll be paying that $1000.
So those other bidders are currently getting $500 each by spending $100.
If you put in $100 as well then the three of you will get $333 each.
This is still profitable and you want to put more into the pot, but at about $222 you start losing money.
Each person putting $222.22 into the pot turns out to be the Nash equilibrium of this game.
</p>
<p>
  So the idea of this mechanism is to compute those equilibrium bids for everyone.
You just say how much you think the whole contract is worth, and the mechanism plays the Nash equilibrium for you, under the maybe-false assumption that everyone has said their true value for the whole contract.
Bidders don&#8217;t have to understand any of that.
They can just keep bumping up their bids as long as the mechanism is giving them a price and a fraction of the contract that feels fair.
</p>
<p>
  It&#8217;s all preposterous amounts of overkill/overcomplication but it did seem to work.

  To recap the argument, if you view Beeminder’s stings as punishment, that can 
(a) encourage an excuse-making mindset over a results-oriented mindset, and maybe more importantly, 
(b) encourage you to make your goals less ambitious. 
If you accept that some derailments are inevitable &#8212; part of the cost of the service, just nudges or rumble strips keeping you on track &#8212; you can dial in a sweet spot where you’re being pushed to do as much as possible (or whatever maximizes the motivational value you get from Beeminder) at minimal cost.

  Here&#8217;s a simple yet powerful weight loss tip: Don&#8217;t eat when you don&#8217;t want to.
</p>
<p>
  I mean, maybe you shouldn&#8217;t always eat even when you
  <em>
    do
  </em>
  want to but at the very least don&#8217;t eat when you
  <em>
    don&#8217;t
  </em>
  want to.
Like because it&#8217;s there, you&#8217;re bored, or to prevent being hungry later.

  If you have other tips and tricks, add them in the comments.

    week
  </a>
  .
That also means no more need for &#8220;temporary test goals&#8221;, so those are gone. Phew!
</p>
<p>
  We also added a limit to the number of new goals you can create without adding a pledge.
We call those pledgeless goals Freebees. 
Creating a goal with no pledge isn&#8217;t really in the spirit of Beeminder, it&#8217;s just needed so people can get acclimated.
So you can now create seven such pledgeless goals (don&#8217;t worry, long-time users, we grandfathered your existing goals).
If you don&#8217;t want to be limited in that way, that brings us to our big announcement&#8230;

  that tends to make people who need Beeminder more (and thus get more value out of beeminding) pay us more.
It&#8217;s beautifully win-win.
But it doesn&#8217;t work for everyone.
Some people are so hardcore, not to mention self-aware, that they can confidently predict that when the chips are down they&#8217;ll shrug off those $5 and $10 pledges.
They want to be immediately bound by more meaningful amounts.

  we introduced the ability to pay us directly &#8212; half the current amount pledged &#8212; to jump to the next pledge level.
In theory that solves the problem but it&#8217;s a painful thing to do.
So we now have a less painful option: 
the ability to jump to any pledge level you want if you pay a subscription fee for Beeminder.
</p>
<p>
  Yes, amusingly, we have premium plans both for people who don&#8217;t want to pledge money on goals and for people who want to pledge

    Fitness tips.

  , and some are mini blog posts not published anywhere else.
They&#8217;re inserted randomly so you&#8217;ll tend to see repeats before you see them all.
In fact, you&#8217;ll probably never actually see them all.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    Custom goals.
  </strong>
  The main attraction of Bee Lite, though, is being able to tweak the crap out of your goal settings. 
You probably only want this if you&#8217;re a power user (the plan was almost named &#8220;Powers That Bee&#8221; but that was rejected). 
Even for power users it&#8217;s rare to need to do these things, but here&#8217;s what you get:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Exponential roads, which can be handy for weight loss if you want to, say, lose half a percent of your bodyweight per week. It&#8217;s not too onerous to approximate this by periodically dialing your road, but it&#8217;s a cool feature in some circumstances. We use it on some of our
    <a href=\\"http://beeminder.com/meta\\">
      meta roads
    </a>
    though those tend to be retrofitted, i.e., we&#8217;re not truly beeminding most of those things. UPDATE:
    <a
      href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/exproad/\\"

    </a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Choose how multiple datapoints on each day are aggregated. For weight loss we default to the minimum and for Do More goals it&#8217;s the sum. But with custom goals you could choose the mean or the max or the first or the last. We&#8217;d be happy to throw in any other function, like median, if anyone had a use for it.

  Plan Bee ($16/month)
</h3>
<p>
  Each plan subsumes all the previous plans so Plan Bee also gets you fitness tips and custom goals.
The main feature of Plan Bee is unlimited Freebees.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    Freebees
  </strong>
  are goals that don&#8217;t have a pledge attached to them.
If you derail you still have to pledge (not pay) to unfreeze.
Normally Freebees are limited to seven to close the loophole where you create a new goal each time you derail so you don&#8217;t have to ever pledge.
Like &#8220;weight&#8221;, &#8220;weight2&#8221;, &#8220;june-weight&#8221;, &#8220;for-real-this-time&#8221;, etc.
It&#8217;s not in the spirit of Beeminder but if you&#8217;re willing to pay us $10/month then knock yourself out.
</p>
<p>
  UPDATE: Enough people misunderstood &#8220;unlimited freebees&#8221; that we decided to make it more in line with what you&#8217;d expect if you only read &#8220;unlimited freebees&#8221;. 
Namely, if you have Plan Bee (or higher) you still have to add a pledge after derailing, but you can immediately (subject to the akrasia horizon) drop it back down to $0.
Normally you can&#8217;t drop your pledge amount below $5 once a pledge is added.
</p>
<p>
  UPDATE: And now you can also set a

  <strong>
    Free short-circuiting.
  </strong>
  Now we&#8217;re getting elite.
Free short-circuiting means you can immediately jump to a motivating pledge level, without paying at each jump.
[UPDATE: There&#8217;s no longer such a thing as paying directly for each jump. 
Beemium is now the only game in town if you want to short-circuit the pledge schedule.]
We&#8217;re very impressed with people who have value for this &#8212; we&#8217;re not sure we do ourselves!
Beemium subscribers are highly akratic and have the foresight to know what will motivate them.
We&#8217;re highly akratic, no question there, but we&#8217;re always a bit delusional about it.
&#8220;Maybe this time $5 will be enough to keep me on track!&#8221;
We&#8217;re pretty
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/exponential\\">

  but some of our most hardcore users can save money by paying for Beemium so they can jump straight to commitment contracts that they know will keep them on track indefinitely.

  <strong>
    Real-time support.
  </strong>
  Since Beemium is so super elite we&#8217;re also letting those folks hang out in our developer chat room where you can ask us questions and often get an immediate response.
Danny, Bethany, and Andy are usually there all day every day.
We&#8217;re on Pacific time, though that doesn&#8217;t always mean much for some of us.

The Beekeeper program, first introduced in our

[UPDATE: $256/month plus a one-time $256 setup cost] 
to have someone personally holding you accountable to your goals, helping you keep your roads dialed in, entering data for you, calling you to make sure you&#8217;re staying on track, and deciding what things to beemind in the first place, then by all means, sign up.
As with all the plans, we&#8217;ll give you a full refund if you&#8217;re not thrilled with what you&#8217;re paying for.

<p>
  But wait, there&#8217;s more! All premium users also get priority email support.
We have a long list of potential premium features so the above will change, though we&#8217;ll try to keep each plan at least as good as what we&#8217;ve just described.
But there are also some things about the plans that we want to commit to&#8230;
</p>
<h2 id=\\"nocarrots\\">
  No Carrots For You
</h2>
<p>
  Seriously, we are all about the stick. 
We do not intend to hold important features as dangling carrots. 
Premium plans are still an experiment but we&#8217;re committed to keeping the non-premium Beeminder a highly functional tool for maximizing the awesomeness of humans prone to procrastination and other forms of akrasia. 
In fact, the
  <em>
    only
  </em>
  things that we&#8217;re going to charge for are:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Features that directly thwart our revenue model, i.e., unlimited freebees and free short-circuiting (or in the future: choosing the beneficiary of your commitment contract
    <a

      id=\\"BEN2\\"
      href=\\"#BEN\\"
    >

    </a>
    )
  </li>
  <li>
    Things that may confuse newbees (we&#8217;re not sure yet whether customizable retroratcheting and auto-ratcheting fall in this category)
  </li>
  <li>
    Goodies that are incidental to the process of beeminding, like fitness tips
  </li>
  <li>
    Things that cost us money to provide (we may make the SMS bot a premium feature for this reason)
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  UPDATE 2016-08-05: 
Well, we&#8217;re embracing carrots now.
I mean, the above is still mostly true, but, not making enough money to be fully sustainable from pledges, we settled on at least one violation of our No Dangling Carrots principle.
Namely, non-premium users only get a limited number of goals.

<p>

The short version is that if you stop using Beeminder, we automatically stop charging you for your premium plan!

  The above is just to re-cap the plans (and demonstrate our Exquisitely Fair Slider, as we call it).
The features shown in brackets are currently live but rather experimental.

  Choosing the beneficiary of your commitment contract would be very sensible as a premium feature.
It&#8217;s surely due to selection bias but our existing users generally feel it works out fine for all involved that Beeminder is the beneficiary, as utterly twisted as that sounds to outsiders.

  Okay, excellent.
Let&#8217;s first talk about Project Euler!
It&#8217;s been around for 18 years and has published a new problem on average every 9.8 days. 
When you solve one you get let in to an exclusive forum for others who solved it and you can show off your solution and see others&#8217; approaches.
It&#8217;s super fun, if you&#8217;re into that kind of thing.
To give you a sense, the very first problem is finding the sum of the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
(Some are a lot more involved, and sometimes highly beautiful.)
Project Euler is a wonderful way to get your feet wet with a new programming language.
Or in my case, gloat about how jaw-droppingly elegant Mathematica code can be.
</p>
<h2>
  How it works
</h2>
<p>
  Assuming you already understand Beeminder, it&#8217;s probably plenty self-explanatory so you can go ahead and dive in by creating a Project Euler goal:
</p>
<center>
  <a href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/projecteuler\\">
    <span style=\\"background-color:#1d76db;color:#FFF;padding:0 16px;font-size:16px;font-weight:600;line-height:3;border-radius:4px;font-family:-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,'Segoe UI',Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;display:inline-block !important\\">
      Create a Project Euler goal!
    </span>
  </a>
</center>
<p>
  If you&#8217;re still reading, we can tell you what to expect.
You give us your Project Euler username (so we can double check that we can find you), and you commit to how many problems you want to solve per week. 
That can be less than one if you want to average, say, one per month.
</p>
<p>

    src=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/euler-screenshot.png\\"
  >
</p>
<p>
  Then all you&#8217;ve got to do is keep solving problems. 
Your Beeminder graph will start out looking like this one here, and you want each day&#8217;s datapoint to be on or above that yellow road.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
  The x-axis starts at 99 there because that happens to be how many Project Euler problems I&#8217;ve personally solved as of this writing.
</p>
<p>
  We automatically check Project Euler periodically to get your score, and if you&#8217;ve got a problem due today, your goal will show up red and we&#8217;ll start emailing you reminders that you need to finish another problem.
If you don&#8217;t get your datapoint on the road by your deadline then your goal
  <a

    derails
  </a>
  , and you pay your pledge to Beeminder.
</p>
<p>
  Forcing yourself to solve mathy programming (programmy math?) problems!
What&#8217;s not to like?

  Four score and seventeen days ago,
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/beehive/\\">
    we announced
  </a>
  our acceptance into the

Today we are proud to announce that we have graduated.
To mark the occasion, here for posterity is our demo pitch, verbatim!

We would also like to thank

    Jenn Lynch
  </a>
  for giving us a beautiful introduction at demo day, and
  <a href=\\"http://www.wongfremont.com/\\">

We can&#8217;t say enough good things about Upstart Labs.
(To clarify, our relationship with Upstart has been separate from the Portland Seed Fund. We are eager to continue working with them and of course will keep our office at Upstart Labs.)

<p>
  Without further ado, here is our demo day presentation&#8230;

<p>
  Howdy, I&#8217;m Bethany Soule, CTO of Beeminder.
We help bring your actions in line with your intentions: 
You pledge to stay on track towards your goals, and if you go off track &#8212; bam! &#8212; we take your money.

</p>
<p>
  People go to great lengths to manufacture willpower. 
For example, they buy gym memberships hoping that they&#8217;ll feel guilty enough to go.
Or they buy a single pack of cigarettes or a single candy bar, even though buying in bulk would be cheaper.
They pay a premium to throttle their future consumption.
These are fairly toothless ways to lock yourself in to your chosen course of action, like smoking less or losing weight.
</p>
<p>
  This problem of procrastination and acting against your own better judgment boils down to this: 
You understand your own best interests when you consider them dispassionately (&#8220;I&#8217;m too fat&#8221;) 
but in the moment your decision-making is distorted by delicious, delicious pie.

<p>
  The problem of self-control may be a ridiculous first world problem but it&#8217;s the granddaddy of first world problems and we aim to solve it.
Beeminder combines self-tracking and financial incentives to change the way people act.

</p>
<p>
  When you create a goal with Beeminder, you create a contract as well. 
If you make consistent progress toward your goal, the service remains free.
But if you go off track, we charge you $5 and correct your course. 
If you go off track a second time, we charge you again.
As long as you put off your good behavior, you continue to get charged. 
Surprisingly our users love us for this.
If you want to make screwing up even harder &#8212; and they do &#8212; you can increase the amount you have at risk.

</p>
<p>
  We call this the Yellow Brick Road.
It shows you where you should be, your data shows where you&#8217;re actually headed, and we tell you how many days you have until you fall behind.
You can see this person is doing really well.
They&#8217;ve lost a bunch of weight and they are actually out-performing their yellow brick road.
We keep you on track by sending you reminders to track your progress, and tips on fitness or productivity. 
The graph is based on your actual performance and we give you the
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/flexbind\\">
    flexibility to change your goals
  </a>
  if you need to or even quit. 
The catch is that we enforce a one-week delay. 
This means that you never fall victim to your distorted in-the-moment decision making.
You&#8217;re always bound by last week&#8217;s good intentions.

  People are using Beeminder right now for all sorts of goal setting and tracking &#8212; for example, to lose weight, wean from caffeine, eat more vegetables, train for a marathon, or finish their thesis.
We use it to ensure we make

</p>
<p>
  Let&#8217;s talk about the market for self-tracking. 
There has been a minor explosion of startups offering commitment devices in the last couple years.
It&#8217;s a small part of a broader movement called
  <a href=\\"http://quantifiedself.com\\">
    Quantified Self
  </a>
  which is rapidly going mainstream &#8212; press about self-tracking is showing up everywhere from Wired to NPR to the Delta in-flight magazine.
</p>
<p>
  There are now dozens of physical devices that people are using to track their fitness, sleep, and weight &#8212; including products like the Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, Fitbit, and the Withings internet-connected scale, to name a few.
There are 65 official and dozens of unofficial Quantified Self groups worldwide, with attendance numbers in the tens of thousands and RunKeeper alone has more than 10 million users.

<p>
  Beeminder is the only one of these tools that
  <em>
    combines
  </em>
  Quantified Self with financial incentives.
We take the data you are already collecting about yourself and give you the insight to make concrete changes in your life.

  >
</p>
<p>
  Let&#8217;s talk about taking over the world, namely, how we&#8217;re going after this market.
</p>
<p>
  We&#8217;re integrating our platform with the most popular self-tracking devices so users&#8217; data is automatically posted to Beeminder from their scale or their smartphone. 
We&#8217;re currently integrated with Withings, Gmail, and GreenGoose sensors, and we&#8217;re working on RunKeeper, Fitbit and several others.
</p>
<p>
  And we also are thought leaders in the field of behavior change &#8212; our blogs refer thousands of unique visitors to Beeminder every month, and we&#8217;ve
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/qs\\">
    presented at Quantified Self
  </a>
  meetups in Portland and New York City.
</p>
<p>
  We&#8217;re constantly increasing the value of Beeminder for our customers and hence the average revenue per customer.
This cohort analysis is pretty insane &#8212; that&#8217;s the value per customer each month
  <em>
    with attrition factored in
  </em>
  .
A customer now is provably worth $12 just in the short term and it looks like it&#8217;ll be an order of magnitude higher for lifetime value.
We&#8217;re literally changing lives with this and our users are saying so loud and clear.

<p>
  Since starting Portland Seed Fund, we&#8217;ve doubled our revenue and doubled our users to more than 4000.

</p>
<p>
  Beeminder was born out of a mixture of behavioral economics research and self-experimentation. 
We&#8217;re a couple of over-educated, lifehacking data nerds.
I&#8217;ve got a Masters degree in computer science from Columbia University, and Dr Daniel Reeves&#8217;s PhD is in algorithmic game theory, and he was previously a research scientist at Yahoo Research in New York.
We have domain expertise in incentive systems and experience building big systems.

  >
</p>
<p>
  Right now we&#8217;re ramen profitable and our revenue is growing steadily.
In other words, we&#8217;re not rushing to raise funding but we might next year, after we hit some key milestones.
Most importantly, we intend to first become a true platform for data-oriented commitment contracts. 
That means completing those integrations with all the popular fitness devices as well as promoting our own API.

  In the meantime, if you&#8217;re excited about crushing procrastination and ending irrational behavior &#8212; you can sign up for Beeminder!
If there&#8217;s anything you
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/wantcanwill/\\">
    want to do, you know you can do, but historically you never get around to
  </a>

<p>
  I&#8217;m a research psychologist who specializes in educational psychology, the study of learning, and instruction.
So I live and breathe motivation and self-regulation strategies. 
And not just professionally. 
I&#8217;ve used so many personal productivity apps!
I started with habit trackers like
  <em>
    Ritual
  </em>
  and
  <em>
    Way of Life
  </em>
  and
  <em>
    Habit Bull
  </em>
  .
None of them worked for me.
What was the consequence of not checking the button next to the habit? 
Nothing. 
I&#8217;d forget about or be too busy to even open the app until the weekend when I&#8217;d try to enter my progress retrospectively.
But I very much needed help developing and maintaining habits.
So I diligently read books on habit formation, from
  <em>
    Better than Before
  </em>
  to
  <em>
    Habits
  </em>
  . 
Even
  <em>
    Lean Habits
  </em>
  , about eating behaviors. 
Intellectually, I knew that habits were the way to go. 
And I was already pretty good at maintaining habits that were intrinsically motivating to me &#8212; doing the dishes, walking my dog &#8212; and I was great at starting new things (learn French! HIIT practice! Whole30!).
But I was still terrible at sustaining challenging habits.
</p>
<p>
  Then I heard about Beeminder. 
I loved their blog posts. 
The Beeminder founders are candid and funny and humble. 
They freely admit when they&#8217;re wrong, and they, as tech people say, eat their own dog food.
I quickly became a fan, but when I looked more closely at Beeminder, I recoiled. 
For all the fancy psych talk about self-regulation and akrasia and motivation, underneath the system are clear behaviorist principles of reinforcement, shaping, and punishment. 
In my day job, I rail against teachers&#8217; overreliance on such principles, and I surely wasn&#8217;t going to start treating myself that way. 
Besides, I&#8217;m a rebellious type, prone to thwart rules when they become too restrictive. 
I didn&#8217;t see how Beeminder could work for someone like me. 
But I couldn&#8217;t find anything else that worked for me. 
Plus I was so captivated by the amount of thought and research put into Beeminder&#8217;s design that I decided to try it. 
(I&#8217;m a girl easily swayed by good research findings.)
That was back in December 2014. 
My initial goals were small, measurable, and very reasonable, as I didn&#8217;t want to start by failing. 
I wanted to pray for two minutes in the evening &#8212; a difficult time for me given that I often work nights and when I don&#8217;t, I have two kids and a husband needing my attention. 
I also wanted to eat more veggies and work with more focus using the
  <a

    title=\\"To save you a click: A pomodoro is a 25-minute block of uninterrupted work, generally sandwiched between 5-minute breaks. And since this is the Beeminder blog, we&#39;re linking to Beeminder&#39;s variant of pomodoros, which they call tocks.\\"

    pomodoro system

    src=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/mgill-pomodoros.png\\"
  >
</p>
<p>
  As a university professor, I work on a semester schedule and often set short-term goals for myself. 
Given that I often work alone, at a computer, it&#8217;s easy for me to lose focus. 
So I began experimenting with pomodoros to shape my work day and increase my productivity. 
You can see from the graph above that this was not an easy habit for me. 
My dots hug the yellow brick road, though usually on the right side of it, thank goodness. 
My end date was the end of the semester in May, and I only had two slip-ups in that time.
In February I derailed with $0 and then kept on track almost all the way to the end where a minor slip cost me $5. 
This increased my next fine to $10, but that was sufficient deterrent to keep me on track until I met my goal.
</p>
<p>
  For me, even a small amount of money is a sufficient deterrent to failing. 
What I hated most was &#8220;derailing&#8221; on the goal and disappointing myself. 
I was happy to see that Beeminder &#8212; even though not as fancy as some habit apps &#8212; was very good at keeping my goal close at hand. 
First, I was able to set up reminders on a schedule that suited me. 
Second, I was automatically reminded when I got within a certain danger zone of failing. 
Third, there was a nice mix of reinforcements (both positive and negative), and punishments to help shape my behavior.
</p>
<p>
  The punishment of losing my $5, and even just of the dreaded &#8220;you derailed!&#8221; notice, were things that I wanted to avoid, but surprisingly, just adding a data point was sufficient negative reinforcement for me.
Working on my habits and checking in regularly on Beeminder allowed me to avoid the negative stimulus of warning emails. 
I could easily stop the negative stimulus by doing my pomodoros.
And the enjoyment of seeing my dots above the yellow brick road served as a positive reinforcement once I entered my data points.
</p>
<p>
  When I chose a habit that was too difficult, Beeminder let me reduce the difficulty &#8212; though I still had to sweat through the next week (what Beeminder calls the akrasia horizon) until the goal became more reasonable.
One of my proudest achievements on Beeminder was going from 0% ability to play the electric bass to playing a full set of 90s rock songs at a local bar with a band six months later, just by practicing my bass daily at night, no matter what other siren songs were calling me.

  So, here&#8217;s my overall impression of Beeminder and its usefulness as a tool for creating and sustaining habits and behavior change looking back over these past few years of Beeminding:
</p>
<h2>
  What beeminding taught me
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    To try new and even hard things: you can delete goals within a week of creating them if they aren&#8217;t working out for you
  </li>
  <li>
    To commit to very
    <a
      href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/smart\\"
      title=\\"Very old but still relevant Beeminder blog post about how Beeminder goals satisfy the S.M.A.R.T. criteria\\"
    >
      specific goals
    </a>
    for specific periods of time, allowing for re-evaluation
  </li>
  <li>
    To look honestly at what goals were worth the cost (e.g., bass playing, French)
  </li>
  <li>
    To take another honest look at what goals were particularly difficult for me to maintain (evening prayer, daily writing practice)
  </li>
  <li>
    That consistent practice can yield automatic habits that I no longer have to beemind (like eating vegetables &#8212; it now just feels wrong to not have vegetables on my plate!)
  </li>
  <li>
    That I can stretch myself, and it&#8217;s enjoyable, but only for a limited number of tasks in a certain period of time
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>
  What I wish Beeminder did better
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Better graphs with different ways of viewing data (Beeminder is great about data export, there&#8217;s just more reporting I&#8217;d like out of the box, seeing my data in different ways, easy zooming, etc)
  </li>
  <li>
    It is still a bit too tech-y; it might scare away those with less patience to experiment, as it is not very intuitive
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>
  What Beeminder is great at
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    I love that Beeminder allows so much data input to be automated
  </li>
  <li>
    As an Apple fan, I especially love the iOS integration that allows my exercise, steps, and active calories burned each day to be automatically recorded (this definitely has increased the amount of daily movement I get!)
  </li>
  <li>
    I love how goals can&#8217;t be changed for a week &#8212; it forces me to think clearly about what is reasonable for me
  </li>
  <li>
    I love how Beeminder is founded in good psychology and focused on habits that lead to long-term changes, and there is so much freedom to pick goals and costs that work for
    <em>
      me
    </em>
  </li>
  <li>
    I love that I can change my habits and set end dates &#8212; I don&#8217;t plan to keep all goals indefinitely
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  I&#8217;m super busy: I work full-time, am raising two school age boys who are very, very demanding, and I volunteer as the board chairperson for a charter school I founded.
Beeminder may have an initial learning curve, but because of all the ways I have to automatically send Beeminder data it means that, once my goals are set up, I spend almost no time interacting with Beeminder itself day to day.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;Beeminding taught me to look honestly at what goals were worth the cost&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  What I love most of all, though, is the integrity of being a part of the Beeminder creators&#8217; world. 
They accept all criticism without defensiveness. 
This helped me overcome a lot of my initial resistance to Beeminder. 
And even later resistance, like when they introduced premium subscription plans. 
I was opposed to paying for Beeminder monthly, but they kept an open dialog, polling users, providing options, and eventually a good compromise resulted. 
They have won my loyalty, more than any other app or product I&#8217;ve purchased. 
Daniel and Bethany continue to blog, keep Beeminder updated regularly, and provide a quick response rate to questions/issues. 
This alone has taught me a lot about how to be responsive and

    title=\\"Example of Beeminder&#39;s amazing attitude towards customer service that also changed my thinking on receiving negative feedback\\"
  >
    receptive to criticism
  </a>
  in my own spheres of influence.
</p>
<p>
  And as to my initial distaste of behaviorism? 
Even my self-determination/intrinsic motivation heroes (e.g., Ed Deci and Richard Ryan) recognize that there are stages to obtaining intrinsic motivation, and some distasteful or unpleasant tasks might just have to be motivated more extrinsically, with the goal of finding intrinsic motivation as much as possible for as many tasks as we have to perform each day. 
I don&#8217;t need to beemind reading cool research on conceptual change, for example, or working on my classes. 
But for those tasks we have little motivation for doing, there&#8217;s Beeminder. 
And for that, I am so very grateful.

  The other day 
(a Very Other day, because I&#8217;ve pulled this from the bottom of Quite A Pile of blog post drafts) 
we were musing idly amongst ourselves about what the psychological effect would be if Beeminder pledges were amounts like $4.99.
</p>
<p>
  The answer is it doesn&#8217;t matter because I can&#8217;t stand so-called
  <a
    href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_pricing\\"
    title=\\"Wikipedia page about this, full of galling fun facts about how common and sneakily effective this is\\"

    psychological pricing
  </a>
  , where you subtract a penny from the price to make it appear cheaper.
It almost makes me hate capitalism. 
No way will Beeminder ever exploit that. 
Unless we have some kind of beehavioral economic reason to exploit it for Good, I suppose.
(We don&#8217;t, because, for Beeminder, $5 should sting more, psychologically speaking, than $4.99, so that&#8217;s more motivational bang per buck.
Incentive alignment!)
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;You&#8217;re exploiting the customer&#8217;s constrained attention with the goal of implanting an inaccurate perception of the actual price&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  But so far my argument for why companies in general shouldn&#8217;t do that amounts to a barf emoji.
Can we put the case against psychological pricing on firmer philosophical principles?
Yes, this is my favorite thing to do.
</p>
<p>
  I think the answer is that pricing things a penny below a round number is deceptive. 
You&#8217;re exploiting the customer&#8217;s constrained attention with the goal of implanting an inaccurate perception of the actual price.
</p>
<p>
  Now that I put it that way, I&#8217;m actually angry that this is a thing. 
And of course psychological pricing is downright benign compared to other crap companies pull.
Like blatantly hidden fees and such. 
Not to mention things like Volkswagen&#8217;s Dieselgate.
</p>
<p>
  (I guess that was timely when this blog post draft materialized in our backlog. 
But the fact that we&#8217;ve pretty much forgotten Dieselgate by now really proves my point.)
</p>
<p>
  Not to get too I-have-a-dream about it but one can imagine a version of capitalism where this isn&#8217;t a problem.
A stronger Better Business Bureau or Consumer Reports, or just different social norms, could solve it.
There are already lines companies can&#8217;t cross, things that consumers do not remotely put up with, like the CEO kicking puppies on YouTube.
Why not include any kind of sociopathic corporate behavior? 
Even small instances of trying to trick you, the kind of thing a friend could never possibly do and stay your friend.
I don&#8217;t know that psychological pricing rises to this level but there&#8217;s so much that consumers should rightly be horrified by and walk away from en masse.
But since all big companies are like that, consumers just feel stuck and are apathetic.
We need to break out of this sucky equilibrium!
</p>
<p>
  So let this be a call for solidarity and a call-to-arms.
Fellow startups, don&#8217;t stoop even to mild shadiness like psychological pricing.
And fellow consumers, cultivate more outrage when companies try to trick you!

    </em>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  If my grad students are any indication, the difference between negative reinforcement and punishment is a common point of confusion.
So let me set the record straight.
Operant conditioning, a key part of behaviorist theory, means shaping behavior through positive and negative stimuli.
It&#8217;s all about rewarding good behavior and punishing bad.
</p>
<p>
  Punishment is what you&#8217;d expect: a response to undesired behavior, to deter it. 
Reinforcement is the opposite: a response to desired behavior to &#8212; that&#8217;s right &#8212; reinforce it. 
Which is to say, get more of it. 
Simple enough.
</p>
<p>
  The confusion comes in when we break those down into the following four fundamental types, based on the type of stimulus and whether we want more of or less of the target behavior:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Positive Reinforcement
  </li>
  <li>
    Negative Reinforcement
  </li>
  <li>
    Positive Punishment
  </li>
  <li>
    Negative Punishment
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Putting &#8220;negative&#8221; in front of those words doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re bad or that they&#8217;re negating the word that comes after.
Negative reinforcement isn&#8217;t the opposite of reinforcement.
Rather, &#8220;negative&#8221; and &#8220;positive&#8221; indicate the type of stimulus used for the punishing and reinforcing.
A positive stimulus is something you add and a negative stimulus is something you take away.
</p>
<p>
  In everyday language, the word &#8220;positive&#8221; implies something good. 
But in the case of operant conditioning, positive is used along mathematical lines &#8212; it means to add something. 
So, positive reinforcement adds a reinforcer. 
Positive punishment adds something aversive. 
Similarly, negative means to subtract, so negative reinforcement means to take away something aversive, and negative punishment means to take away something good.
</p>
<p>
  Electric shock is a classic positive punishment.
It&#8217;s something aversive when you exhibit the wrong behavior.
A negative punishment could be taking away a favorite toy from a child. 
You&#8217;re removing a positive stimulus.
The obvious one, positive reinforcement, is giving someone a metaphorical (or literal) cookie. 
And finally, the most misused term, negative reinforcement, means rewarding you with the removal of an aversive stimulus. 
Like the annoying beeping that stops when you put on your seatbelt.
</p>
<p>
  Here&#8217;s a table I use with my students to drive that home:

</p>
<p>
  Bringing this back to Beeminder, paying the $5 pledge is a positive punishment.
That&#8217;s less motivating for me.
But stopping the negative stimuli of the warning emails, that negative reinforcement motivates me a lot.
</p>
<p>
  Punishment is generally considered the least effective for motivating behavior change.
Behaviorists, including the father of Behaviorism, B.F. Skinner himself, argue that it comes with a host of side effects and often the behavior change
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.verywell.com/what-is-punishment-2795413\\"
    title=\\"Nice overview on punishment\\"
  >
    doesn&#8217;t persist
  </a>
  . 
It does work, though, in the short term, and the painful consequences of having to pay an increasing fine when one derails is an effective consequence to initiate behavior change.
It&#8217;s just not a sufficient motivator for me.
</p>
<p>
  Positive reinforcement is the most pleasant extrinsic motivator, yet it&#8217;s highly individualized. 
For one person, a slice of cake is motivating, for another, a cash reward, for another, praise. 
For me, adding a data point to show a goal being met was a type of positive reinforcement, but since much of my data is automated, the visual effect on my graph was less immediate (and thus less reinforcing, according to behaviorist principles). 
Seeing my dots above the yellow brick road was positively reinforcing as a sign that I was staying &#8220;on track&#8221; with my goal, but they didn&#8217;t have the &#8220;oomph&#8221; of a true, immediate reinforcer.
(Which is why other habit trackers didn&#8217;t work for me. There was no consequence of not adding my data, no compelling reason not to ignore logging my progress for the day.)
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;Completing my goals each day removes something negative &#8212; being yelled at by Beeminder&#8217;s email bot&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  Here&#8217;s where negative reinforcement works for me. 
Completing my goals each day removes something negative &#8212; being yelled at by Beeminder&#8217;s email bot.
Again, reinforcement is highly individualistic.
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"CANDY1\\"
    href=\\"#CANDY\\"
  >
    [2]
  </a>
  For me, a people pleaser, I guess that transfers to pleasing the Beeminder Bot. 
At least it connects with not disappointing myself. 
So, each day I can relax once my goals are done, knowing I&#8217;m &#8220;on track&#8221; and not going to be in trouble with myself for failing to meet a goal. 
Thus, negative reinforcement actually reinforces (increases) behavior.
</p>
<p>
  <br>
  &nbsp;
  <br>
</p>
<p>
  In any case, the hidden brilliance of Beeminder, to me, is that it contains multiple means of motivating habits. 
For some, like me, it may operate primarily via negative reinforcers. 
For others, the positive reinforcement of the pretty graph suffices. 
And for others, or for particularly difficult habits, the threat of punishment &#8212; paying money in this case &#8212; might be sufficient to initiate behavior change. 
Because that&#8217;s too controlling for me, inciting my inner rebel, I keep the fines low, around $5, but that could change if I needed to create a habit that was particularly difficult but critical to establish. 
For example, if I developed a medical condition requiring a radical change of diet, and I was having difficulty making the appropriate changes, I&#8217;d up the ante on the fine and use that as incentive to stick to the straight and narrow with my diet.
</p>
<p>
  As to why one would pay Beeminder rather than just lie or fake data, well, that&#8217;s a whole &#8216;nother aspect of psychology beyond the space I have here to discuss, but one which Beeminder&#8217;s founders

  The fact that my graduate students struggle with this is not an anomaly. 
Psychologists often coin terms that don&#8217;t quite mesh with how they are used outside of the discipline.
(More examples: self-concept is different from self-esteem, being an origin means having autonomy, authoritative parenting is good; authoritarian is not.)
Given the confusion, there&#8217;s been

  Another example from a classroom environment:
For many students, candy is a good motivator, but for some, especially those who cannot eat candy, it has little reinforcement value. 
Similarly, some kids may perceive attention as a positive thing; others, as something to be avoided.

    ) on a couple ideas that came together and turned into Beeminder, which they co-founded in 2010.
Through much personal experimentation they&#8217;ve developed unique ideas on how best to visualize your progress towards a goal and how to set just the right amount of monetary incentive.
  </em>
</p>
<h2>
  How do you describe Beeminder? What is it?
</h2>
<p>
  <strong>
    Soule
  </strong>
  : Beeminder is a goal-tracking tool with teeth. Report your progress every day and make sure to keep all your data points on a &#8220;yellow brick road&#8221; to your goal. If you fail to do so your graph will be frozen and you can pledge (by which we mean pledge actual money) to stay on track on your next attempt.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    Reeves
  </strong>
  : The idea is to give yourself a kick in the pants. Here&#8217;s how to tell if Beeminder could be useful for you: Is there something you know you should do, you really do want to do, you know for certain you
  <em>
    can
  </em>
  do, yet that historically you don&#8217;t do? (Also, are you a highly nerdy data freak?)
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    Soule
  </strong>
  : What we mean by the &#8220;yellow brick road&#8221; is a line on your graph that gradually gets you from here to there and tolerates some daily deviation without allowing a slippery slope of sloth.
</p>
<h2>
  What&#8217;s the backstory? What led to it?
</h2>
<p>
  <strong>
    Reeves
  </strong>
  : I had a friend who wanted to lose weight. This was in February 2008. I had her email me her weight every day and I&#8217;d send her back graphs of her progress and tell her if she was on track to hit her target in time. I was mostly following the principles of
  <a href=\\"http://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet\\">
    The Hacker&#8217;s Diet
  </a>
  , in particular the part about getting as much data as possible but smoothing it so as not to be discouraged by random fluctuations.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    Soule
  </strong>
  : I quickly wanted in on it, because I was tracking my own weight in Excel &#8212; Lame! So we started automating it and getting more friends and family on board. We called it Kibotzer (the kibitzing robot), though no one got the pun. Even before we started with the data collection and visualization side of things we&#8217;d been making bets with each other as part of various productivity schemes for quite some time, so it was only natural to bet about staying on track with our graphs.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    Reeves
  </strong>
  : We&#8217;ve since dropped the betting terminology but it&#8217;s equivalent. Now you&#8217;re pledging (money) to stay on track on your yellow brick road. (HT:
  <a href=\\"http://dirtsimple.org\\">
    PJ Eby
  </a>
  )
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    Soule
  </strong>
  : In 2010 we decided to quit our day jobs and turn it into a real startup, which we
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/beenamer\\">
    renamed
  </a>
  Beeminder.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    Reeves
  </strong>
  : But if you really want to trace the roots, the backstory starts in 2005 when Bethany and I were dating and I was writing my dissertation. I&#8217;d been dragging it out forever so Bethany concocted a Voluntary Harassment Program, as she called it, and we tried out all kinds of crazy incentive schemes and productivity hacks. They apparently worked, since I got my PhD that year.
</p>
<h2>
  What impact has it had? What have you heard from users?
</h2>
<p>
  <strong>
    Soule
  </strong>
  : Our users think it&#8217;s the bees&#8217; knees! I assume that bees have awesome knees.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    Reeves
  </strong>
  : We do have a small number of users who find it powerfully motivating. Lots of weight loss success stories, of course. And we use it to force ourselves to keep up momentum on Beeminder itself.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    Soule
  </strong>
  : Here&#8217;s an ongoing success story that we blogged about: Our friend and early beta user, Jill, wanted to join a new gym, which is often a recipe for throwing away money. But she actually worked out how often she would need to go to make the membership worth the money (1.8 times per week, on average) and then used a large Beeminder contract to force herself to maintain that average. That&#8217;s been going since March:
  <a href=\\"http://beeminder.com/jill/gym\\">
    beeminder.com/jill/gym
  </a>
  .
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    Reeves

  : There are plenty of failure stories, too. We find that it really only makes sense to beemind things that are both objectively measurable and that you have complete control over. So you can beemind how much time you spend working but not, say, how focused you are. Weight loss is a borderline case: you don&#8217;t have
  <em>
    complete
  </em>
  control over it since your weight fluctuates randomly from day to day, but we&#8217;ve put a ton of work into adjusting for that with an

<h2>
  What makes it different, sets it apart?
</h2>
<p>
  <strong>
    Reeves
  </strong>
  : Primarily that it works as a
  <a href=\\"http://messymatters.com/akrasia\\">
    commitment device
  </a>
  . Most goal-tracking sites don&#8217;t work that way (nor do they want to). A notable exception is
  <a href=\\"http://stickk.com\\">
    StickK.com
  </a>
  . What sets Beeminder apart from StickK is the focus on the data and the graph and Yellow Brick Road. By having everything based on your data you get far more flexibility. We think it&#8217;s more motivating and insightful to pledge to keep your data points on a yellow brick road to your goal than to StickK to your goal.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    Soule
  </strong>
  : Yeah, with StickK it&#8217;s all about the contracts. You have to fully pre-specify exactly what you&#8217;re committing to do and how much money to put at risk to force yourself to do it. With Beeminder you just first start tracking. Your data then informs you on what to commit to. You don&#8217;t even have to think about how much to risk &#8212; we tell you, and you climb up the fee schedule until you hit an amount that really motivates you. There&#8217;s also this clever thing called the &#8220;
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/dial\\">
    akrasia horizon
  </a>
  &#8221; that lets you continuously adjust your commitment &#8212; the steepness of the yellow brick road &#8212; without it, y&#8217;know, defeating the whole point of a commitment contract.
</p>
<h2>
  What are you doing next? How do you see Beeminder evolving?
</h2>
<p>
  <strong>
    Reeves
  </strong>
  : We&#8217;re working our butts off on a ton of features that our users are asking for in the
  <a href=\\"http://uservoice.beeminder.com\\">
    Beeminder feedback forum
  </a>
  .
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    Soule
  </strong>
  : Beeminder is literally getting better every day. In fact, we&#8217;re beeminding that: We have to make
  <a href=\\"http://beeminder.com/meta/uvi\\">
    one User-Visible Improvement to Beeminder on average per day
  </a>
  or pay one of our users $1000. We&#8217;ll have made about 300 improvements when this goes to press!
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    Reeves
  </strong>
  : In the near future we&#8217;d like to add more ways to automatically collect data instead of needing to report data points to the Beeminder bot. We can currently connect Beeminder to
  <a href=\\"http://partners.withings.com/c/22896/11341/583\\">
    Withings scales
  </a>
  [affiliate link] and our own (very hacky)
  <a href=\\"http://messymatters.com/tagtime\\">
    TagTime stochastic time tracker
  </a>
  . 
Bethany also made a pushup counter for Android which semi-automatically counts pushups (you put the phone on the floor and touch your nose to it). 
Finally, we have a version of our API in private beta which a couple people have used to automatically send data to Beeminder as it&#8217;s collected.

<h3>
  1: Track Your Time.
</h3>
<p>
  Howdy I&#8217;m Bee.
A couple years ago I founded Beeminder with Danny Reeves.
Beeminder is Quantified Self + Commitment Contracts. 
That means you pledge money to stay on track toward your goals and we collect your data, graph it, and if you fall behind we take your money.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;Was I actually spending 18 hours of the day doing a depth-first search of the internet?&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  This is a story of akrasia, time tracking, beehavior change, and the birth of Beeminder.
Right. So. I&#8217;m akratic.
Meaning, I do stuff against my own better judgement
  <em>
    all the time
  </em>
  .
Definitely including
  <em>
    that
  </em>
  [points to cookie monster].
In particular it seems like I waste massive amounts of time when left to my own devices.
</p>
<p>
  So I started to track my time.
I wanted to know was I actually spending 18 hours of the day doing a depth-first search of the internet?
</p>
<p>
  If you&#8217;re interested in tracking time too, I highly recommend
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.rescuetime.com/2012/11/27/give-your-productivity-goals-some-teeth-with-beeminder/\\"
    title=\\"RescueTime blog post extolling the virtues of combining RescueTime with Beeminder\\"
  >
    RescueTime
  </a>
  .
It&#8217;s awesome. It just runs in the background on your computer, et voila. You are tracked.
</p>
<p>
  My problem with the totally passive solution is it can only track things that happen at the computer and it can&#8217;t easily collect info like what project this code is part of, or if I am in fact daydreaming.
</p>
<p>
  The solution we came up with was stochastic self-sampling. 
We call it
  <a
    href=\\"http://messymatters.com/tagtime\\"
    title=\\"Yes, you kind of have to read this whole blog post, not to mention clone a git repository, etc, before you can actually use TagTime. There is a friendlier version as an Android app though, also by us.\\"
  >
    TagTime
  </a>
  .
It runs in the background on my computer and at unpredictable intervals throughout the day it pops up a window and asks &#8220;What are you doing right now?&#8221; 
I add text tags which get written to a log file along with the timestamp.
</p>
<p>
  It&#8217;s random &#8212; every 45 minutes on average &#8212; so over the course of a single day there&#8217;s high variance, but over time I get a very accurate picture of how I spend my time.
I&#8217;ve been doing this since 2007. 
I&#8217;ve got over 72 thousand entries in my log. 
So that&#8217;s pretty accurate.
</p>
<h3>
  2: Graph Your Time
</h3>
<p>
  In 2007 when we started this I was in grad school.
I wanted to make sure I was treating it like a full time job and spending 40 hours a week on it.
So we started graphing the data. 
And we went a step further.
This yellow line, the &#8220;yellow brick road&#8221;, shows how much I should be doing &#8212; the idealized path. 
The data points are how much I&#8217;ve actually done.
</p>
<p>
  If tracking changed my behavior, it still did not make me more efficient.
I didn&#8217;t keep on track &#8212; in fact, this looks a lot like what you&#8217;d expect from a student.
Not much time spent in the beginning of the semester, then at the end I worked like crazy.
I was exhibiting the same behaviors as before, only now I had proof.
</p>
<h3>
  3: Daily Progress; Risk Money
</h3>
<p>
  Fast-forward a couple years, Danny and I were using TagTime to track the time we spent on building Beeminder.
We had read a Paul Graham essay about startups called 
&#8220;
  <a href=\\"http://www.paulgraham.com/die.html\\">
    How Not to Die
  </a>
  &#8221; 
in which he suggests that if you could fully commit yourself to not giving up, your chances of success would be 90%.
So, naturally, we started to bet on our yellow brick roads!
We committed to staying on track and never falling below 40 hours a week or we&#8217;d pay actual money.
</p>
<p>
  At first it was to friends who we&#8217;d make literal bets with.
Now we&#8217;re both up $270 and that money goes to our users. 
We also took the plunge and left our day jobs to work on Beeminder all the time.
</p>
<h3>
  4: Track the Right Metric
</h3>
<p>
  We were fully committed. We had rich data, and nice graphs. We had money on the line. 
But we got up to 2000 person-hours or so and we still weren’t publicly launched, our beta users couldn’t create new goals without going through an admin interface, and it was seriously tempting to throw in the towel and get a real job.
</p>
<p>
  Tracking time is important &#8212; forcing ourselves to put in a minimum amount of time has sometimes been a necessary kick in the butt and sometimes is a welcome excuse to escape and get back to work &#8212; but it was not enough.
</p>
<p>
  So we decided to commit ourselves to visible forward progress. 
In February of 2011 we made up a metric &#8212; User Visible Improvements, or UVIs &#8212; and we
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/blogdog\\">
    committed to averaging one per day
  </a>
  . 
We tweet them to
  <a
    href=\\"http://twitter.com/beemuvi\\"
    title=\\"This is Beeminder&#39;s public changelog\\"
  >
    @beemuvi
  </a>
  , 
so users can keep tabs on us.
</p>
<p>
  If we fail — if we ever fall below that Beeminder road — we’ll pay a user $1000.
Our users pay us when they go off track, and we pay our users when we go off track.
We&#8217;ve been at it for over two years now, and
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/uvi\\"
    title=\\"We did, and here&#39;s the story!\\"
  >
    we&#8217;ll hit 1000 UVIs on Nov 16
  </a>
  .
So the results?
</p>
<h3>
  5: Awesomeness!
</h3>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;I totally still procrastinate. But I have a tool that lets me parameterize how much.&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  Beeminder pays my bills now, and makes thousands of people more productive and awesomer every day!
Minding that metric (UVIs) means the focus is on making our users happier every single day (on average!)
Which makes them shockingly happy to pay us when they go off track.

</p>
<p>
  I track a bunch of other stuff too, both manual and automatic, like pushups, getting to bed on time, working on my QS talk, and my weight.
</p>
<p>
  Beeminder&#8217;s combination of Quantified Self + Stakes has done wonders to improve the happiness of this overambitious lazy programmer.
I totally still procrastinate. 
But I have a tool that lets me parameterize how much.

<p>
  Hi! Thanks for coming to my talk on extreme productivity!
I&#8217;m cofounder and CTO of Beeminder, which is itself a kind of extreme productivity tool. 
I use it to drive a lot of my own productivity methods.
Beeminder is a quantified self tool that uses your data to fuel behavior change.
You pledge money to stay on track towards your goals, we collect your data, send you reminders, make a graph, and if you don&#8217;t do what you said you were going to do, we take your money.
</p>
<p>
  We needed a tool to combat procrastination, and came up with Beeminder.
There&#8217;s been a lot of experimentation along the way.
</p>
<p>
  A couple years ago my cofounder, Danny, showed me Nick Winter&#8217;s blog post 
&#8220;
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.nickwinter.net/the-120-hour-workweek-epic-coding-time-lapse\\"
    title=\\"Epic Coding Time-Lapse\\"
  >
    The 120-Hour Workweek
  </a>
  &#8221;.
</p>
<p>
  Nick did 120 hours of coding in one maniac week by, as close as possible, doing literally nothing but coding and sleeping. 
That involved 6.38 hours of sleep per day, seven bars of dark chocolate, 402 unanswered emails, 44 commits, and 99 Trello cards slain.
</p>
<p>
  I read about this and naturally I thought &#8220;That&#8217;s insane. &#8230; I want to try it!&#8221;
Last fall I finally gave it a try.
</p>
<p>
  For a &#8220;proper&#8221; maniac week you need to do more than just
  <em>
    try hard
  </em>
  to keep focused.
</p>
<h3>
  1. Publicly precommit
</h3>
<p>
  This lets everyone know you&#8217;re essentially off the grid, and gives you a strong incentive to stay focused.
I announced it in a weekly Beeminder newsletter.
</p>
<h3>
  2. Remove distractions
</h3>
<p>
  Take vacation from your job, send your kids to summer camp, get an Airbnb in the middle of nowhere. 
Whatever it takes.
I sent my kids to Canada for a family reunion.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, the most important thing:
</p>
<h3>
  3. Document it
</h3>
<p>
  Take screenshots of your work, and of your face hopefully studiously looking at that work. 
Create a timelapse video and post it to the public record for awesomeness and glory afterwards.
</p>
<p>
  Bonus points for writing a blog post.
</p>
<p>
  <br>
  &nbsp;
  <br>
</p>
<p>
  I really enjoyed this, so much so that I followed it up with three more variations in the next 6 months.
</p>
<p>
  But let&#8217;s see some stats:
I more than doubled my usual 40 hours per week, putting in 87 hours.
That&#8217;s 87 hours unambiguously on task, not just hours at the computer. 
I pushed 69 commits to GitHub, compared to 16 in the previous week, closed 19 Trello cards, and did 37 hours worth of pomodoros.
</p>
<p>
  I got more than double the work of an average week done, and I enjoyed it.
</p>
<p>
  What about efficiency? 
Programmers talk about
  <a
    href=\\"http://heeris.id.au/2013/this-is-why-you-shouldnt-interrupt-a-programmer/\\"
    title=\\"Hey, so I just sent you an email about that thing\\"
  >
    task switching being costly
  </a>
  , 
as you have to load a new context into your head every time you switch or are interrupted. 
This feels true to me, though I&#8217;m not sure what metric to measure it by. 
But big uninterrupted blocks of time feel valuable.
</p>
<p>
  Most negative reactions go roughly, &#8220;Idiot. You&#8217;ll burn out!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
  I&#8217;d burn out doing this every week, but I&#8217;m not! 
And in fact there were things that were really relaxing about it, like getting to sleep as much as I wanted every night.
</p>
<p>
  There
  <em>
    were
  </em>
  hard parts. 
It was physically hard to sit still that much! 
A standing workstation would&#8217;ve been clutch.
I also was surprised to find it mentally taxing to be alone for an entire week. 
A couple of my later iterations I had company working alongside me and those I found more pleasant.
</p>
<p>
  The biggest failure or hardest part was insufficient preparation. 
I didn&#8217;t have a well developed task list. 
Deciding what to work on next was costly. 
Or a task I wanted to work on didn&#8217;t have a solid spec to work from.
I&#8217;ve not solved the spec problem, but I&#8217;ve been using Mark Forster&#8217;s
  <em>
    Final Version
  </em>
  system to prioritize my task list lately. Recommended.
</p>
<p>
  <br>
  &nbsp;
  <br>
</p>
<p>
  What else did I learn? 
What can be captured and brought back to my day-to-day?
</p>
<h3>
  Commitment matters
</h3>
<p>
  For obvious reasons, the screenshot every minute, and the public commitment to publish it after the fact were a huge pressure to keep working.
</p>
<p>
  Normal people do this by, say, having a boss, or pair programming, or agile-style stand-up meetings. 
I use Beeminder. 
For example, our User-Visible Improvements goal promises
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/bikes/\\"
    title=\\"That&#39;s right, we&#39;ve paid $1000 to a user before (and many smaller amounts as well) for going briefly off track on this\\"
  >
    $1000
  </a>
  to a user if we fall behind.
</p>
<h3>
  Don&#8217;t read email
</h3>
<p>
  It was amazingly attention-freeing to sign out of Gmail and know that no responses were expected for an entire week. 
The internet has a lot to say about strategies for dealing with email.
(I&#8217;ve tried
  <a
    href=\\"http://emailga.me/\\"
    title=\\"Sort of gamifying or just making a contest out taking quick passes through your inbox\\"
  >
    The Email Game
  </a>
  and our own
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/gmailzeroer\\"
    title=\\"Our most recent blog post about GmailZero, GmailZeroer\\"
  >
    GmailZero
  </a>
  .)
</p>
<p>
  Looking at my data, it turns out I only spend about an hour per day in Gmail on average, so rather than being more efficient I decided to just care less.
</p>
<h3>
  Live at your office
</h3>
<p>
  I kid. But time spent commuting is irretrievable and having no friction to beginning my workday gave the whole day a sense of momentum.
</p>
<p>
  Short of actually moving into your office, you could start the day by doing a pomodoro before breakfast.
</p>
<h3>
  Remove distractions
</h3>
<p>
  A Maniac Week is an extreme way to get rid of distractions, by effectively going off the grid for a week.
</p>
<p>
  But in the day-to-day I&#8217;m my own biggest distraction &#8212; email, facebook, I think my phone just flashed, am I hungry?, etc.
</p>
<p>
  Turns out there&#8217;s a lot you can do for this kind of distraction. 
For starters you can forcefully block yourself from distracting sites on the internet.
  <a
    href=\\"http://rescuetime.com\\"
    title=\\"RescueTime is the bees&#39; knees\\"
  >
    RescueTime
  </a>
  , 
StayFocusd, and Freedom are a few programs that do this. 
Or the old
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.google.com/search?q=%2Fetc%2Fhosts+block+facebook\\"
    title=\\"Some nerdery required\\"
  >
    /etc/hosts trick
  </a>
  .
</p>
<p>
  Usually when I get distracted by the internet it is a lack of attention more than anything else. 
I finish a task and on autopilot I launch Facebook and I&#8217;m down the rabbit hole. 
Noticing this, the tiniest little fix has worked: 
I just sign out of Facebook when I close the site. 
Next time I launch Facebook, I get a login screen instead of the news feed. 
98% of the time that&#8217;s enough to stop me.
</p>
<p>
  Another tiny interrupt like this that makes a big difference for me is to move my phone out of sight and out of reach. 
It&#8217;s suddenly much less distracting.
</p>
<h3>
  Pomodoros
</h3>
<p>
  The crux of the Pomodoro System is to set a timer for a manageable amount of time (canonically 25 minutes, but
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/tocks\\"
    title=\\"Bee&#39;s previous blog post on 45-minute pomodoros\\"
  >
    I like 45
  </a>
  ), 
and do focused work until the timer goes off. 
Then you take a brief break, rinse and repeat.
</p>
<p>
  My most common failure mode with pomodoros is failing to start the next one.
So of course I beemind it, and that keeps my momentum going.
During my first maniac week, as an added incentive to my public precommitment I set a steep daily pomodoro goal for myself, and found that it was really effective at keeping me rolling through the day. 
Since then I&#8217;ve continued to track my total time working, but it&#8217;s the pomodoro goal that drives my productivity.
</p>
<p>
  If &#8220;do focused work&#8221; sounds like the hard part, here are a couple tips:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Pick a concrete task. (E.g., instead of &#8220;read&#8221;, use &#8220;finish reading 20 pages&#8221;.)
  </li>
  <li>
    Even better, write it down, or announce it publicly.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you notice you&#8217;re distracted, note down the distraction (literally, on a piece of paper) and then gently guide your attention back to the task at hand. 
(It&#8217;s like meditation, and you get better at it with practice.)
  </li>
</ol>

  You may have noticed the shiny new design of
  <a href=\\"http://beeminder.com\\">
    Beeminder
  </a>
  .
For nerds who know about such things: we switched to
  <a href=\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails\\">
    Ruby on Rails
  </a>
  .
For non-nerds: we added buzzwords to our internets!
</p>
<p>
  Either way, it was kind of a big deal, even though it doesn&#8217;t look like much just yet.
Step one was to replicate everything that the old incarnation (called Kibotzer, for those just tuning in) could do, and most of that was behind the scenes.

The official determinant of User-Visible Improvements is the number of tweets at

    Examples of things that count: New blog posts, fixing typos, tweaking the layout or the logo or whatever, improvements to how the bot responds to emails, tweaks to the algorithm for generating the yellow brick road, tweets from our main twitter account (

    <em>
      Are you somehow stumbling upon this blog post without knowing anything about Beeminder?
Hoo-boy are you in the wrong place.
But here&#8217;s a frenzied attempt to catch you up in time:
Beeminder graphs your progress toward goals by drawing a bright line, called the Yellow Brick Road, that you commit to having all your datapoints hew to.
Like getting at least 10k steps per day on average as measured by your Fitbit or Garmin (we integrate with gadgets and webservices like that).
If you don&#8217;t stay on track, we charge you money.
It&#8217;s very motivating!
And a key thing we keep you apprised of as you follow your yellow brick road is how much safety buffer you have &#8212; how many days until you derail.
Derailing means you&#8217;ve gone off track and we charge you money.
All clear?
      <br>
      &nbsp;
      <br>
      So sometimes you accumulate too much safety buffer and what&#8217;s the fun in that?
You want to skate the edge, with Beeminder nipping at your heels, pushing you to do more than you&#8217;d otherwise do (or less &#8212; some Beeminder goals are about doing less of something, like eating sugar or surfing Facebook).
Or maybe you just want to set some daily bare minimum, no matter how much you&#8217;ve overachieved previously.
We call that ratcheting because you&#8217;re making that yellow brick road jump closer to your current datapoint and, by the nature of the commitment contract, you can&#8217;t make it easier again once you&#8217;ve done that.
Not without waiting a week, at least.
Beeminder&#8217;s a little complicated, ok?
But if you understood all that, we suppose you&#8217;re ready to read Bee&#8217;s post here!
    </em>

<p>
  <strong>
    Announcement!
  </strong>
  Ratcheting (reducing your safety buffer) and 
auto-ratcheting (capping your safety buffer) 
no longer change the dates of future changes (like breaks that you scheduled on purpose) in your yellow brick road.
It also means the weekends-off feature plays nice with all those other features.
</p>
<h2>
  Background
</h2>
<p>
  Due to various historical circumstances, like
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/ybhp\\"
    title=\\"Blog post for background on what &#39;lane width&#39; was but it&#39;s not a thing anymore so this is of historical interest only!\\"
  >
    lane width
  </a>
  , and our own runaway &#8220;cleverness&#8221;, it used to be the case that when you ratcheted most goals (Do Less and Rationing goals not included), we would shift your entire future road over along the x-axis, until it was the appropriate number of days away from your current datapoint.
That had the side-effect of moving the dates of all of your future road segments to be closer as well.
In other words, if you ratcheted the road by one day, then your upcoming weekend, or vacation, or whatever, would move one day closer.
Which isn&#8217;t usually how scheduled vacations work. 
The airlines don&#8217;t move your tickets one day earlier because you got extra work done before leaving for Hawaii.
</p>
<p>
  That also meant that you couldn&#8217;t both (a) automatically cap your safety buffer, and (b) have automatic weekends-off. 
Quite the thorn in the side of you overachievers who wanted to do a
  <em>
    minimum
  </em>
  of 7 hours of work a day, while still setting aside weekends to pay attention to your family, or whatnot.
</p>
<p>
  Anyhow, we&#8217;ve fixed it all up and everything is perfect now! &#8230;
</p>
<p>
  &#8230; With the following caveats:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Flat spots on roads are a little weird now.
  </li>
  <li>
    Do Less goals are a little different in how they do weekends-off, and nothing has changed with them + auto-ratcheting. 
(If they were working for you before, they still should. If they weren&#8217;t, uh, email support so I can hear about it!)
  </li>
  <li>
    For Do More goals, weekends-off doesn&#8217;t mean weekends are ignored when we count how many safe days you have, we just automatically schedule a two-day break every Saturday and Sunday.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  The main motivation for this post is to explain the new weirdness with flat spots and help you figure out how to get what you want out of your yellow brick road.
This is, in certain circumstances, a slight disimprovement for Do More ratcheters wanting to get rid of flat spots, and hence, by the
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/pdp\\"
    title=\\"Short version: If we make a change that&#39;s in any way a regression for any users or use cases, we have to blog about why we made that tradeoff!\\"
  >
    Pareto Dominance Principle
  </a>
  , we are blogging it.
</p>
<p>
  The short version: when manually ratcheting, you may sometimes have to submit the form twice to get rid of all of your buffer when there&#8217;s a flat spot.
Further, there may sometimes be amounts of buffer that are essentially off limits unless you make an adjustment to the flat spot elsewhere (other than by ratcheting). 
Taking those in reverse order, let&#8217;s dive in.
</p>
<h2>
  Some amounts of buffer are off limits
</h2>
<p>
  Think of it this way.
If you have set the coming weekend &#8220;off&#8221;, then we don&#8217;t let you set an amount of safety buffer that will cause you to work on the weekend (without you going and changing the weekend so that it is &#8220;on&#8221;).
</p>
<p>
  Example time! 
Let&#8217;s say it&#8217;s Monday, and you have weekends-off, so the coming Saturday and Sunday are flat:
</p>
<img src=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-12-at-18.01.13.png\\">
<p>
  You&#8217;ve currently got more than a week of buffer because you&#8217;ve done extra work, but you don&#8217;t want to be a slacker the rest of the week.
You can shave off one day of buffer and put yourself at seven days, no problem:
</p>
<img src=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-12-at-18.09.47.png\\">
<p>
  You could also reduce the road down to just four days of buffer &#8212; that makes your next beemergency on Friday. 
That&#8217;s no problem:
</p>
<img src=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-12-at-18.12.09.png\\">
<p>
  Anywhere between zero and four days is fine, actually.
</p>
<h4>
  Weekend Weirdness
</h4>
<p>
  It&#8217;s at five and six days of buffer (in this case) that things are weird.
</p>
<p>
  Notice the warning here, with that flat spot within our sights?
&#8220;You&#8217;ve got an upcoming flat spot. You may not be able to remove all of your buffer.&#8221;
</p>
<img src=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-12-at-18.01.44.png\\">
<p>
  Because of that flat spot you cannot make it so that you have five or six days of buffer, because five days from now is a weekend. 
And you scheduled the weekend flat. 
So we&#8217;re going to take that seriously and the weekend days become off limits.
If you try to ratchet to five or six, the road just returns seven days of buffer.
</p>
<p>
  A nice side-effect of treating flat spots like you truly meant them is that capping your safety buffer (AKA auto-ratchet) now works fine with weekends-off and vacations without having to turn auto-ratchet off during your vacation and then restore the cap when you come back.

    There&#8217;s a classic joke about a math professor where a student raises their hand in lecture to ask, &#8220;in step 17, how do we know such-and-such?&#8221; and the professor says &#8220;it&#8217;s obvious&#8221; and the student&#8217;s like &#8220;but what about blah blah blah?&#8221; and the professor says &#8220;oh. hmm&#8230; well&#8230;&#8221; and then stares at the board, then they start scribbling equations, fill the entire blackboard up, stare some more, then finally: &#8220;Aha! Yup, it
    <i>
      is
    </i>
    obvious.&#8221;
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
    Working this out reminded us of that joke a few times.
It can seem baffling that this can be as complicated as it is &#8212; &#8220;I have X days of buffer can you just make it be Y jeez&#8221; &#8212; and working out the underlying math can both cut away a lot of needless complexity and also make clear how much complexity is intrinsic.
Anyway, here for your amusement &#8212; or to make the arithmophobes scatter like mice &#8212; is some of the reams of math we did, convincing ourselves that we implemented this right:

<h4>
  Wait, I see a flat spot ahead, but there&#8217;s no &#8220;you&#8217;ve got a flat spot&#8221; message
</h4>
<p>
  Check it out. 
When the road gets scooched up close enough to your current datapoint that the flat spot is above you, the warning about &#8220;upcoming flat spot&#8221; goes away.
In our example case, that&#8217;s anywhere below five days of buffer.
</p>
<img src=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-12-at-18.12.40.png\\">
<p>
  In this case you do have a flat spot in the future, but it is not within your safety horizon, so it&#8217;s not relevant at this point.
The flat spot is five days away, and your next beemergency is in four days, so the flat spot can&#8217;t currently affect any ratchets you make.
Or, for a more visual explanation of what I mean by your &#8220;safety horizon&#8221;, see how your current datapoint is below the level of that flat spot in the road?
So it&#8217;s just not relevant at this point, because you can only change the road a little bit right now.

<h2>
  Killing a future flat spot
</h2>
<p>
  Ok, that&#8217;s all well and good with a future flat spot. 
But what if you actually
  <em>
    want
  </em>
  to kill that flat spot that you scheduled?
</p>
<p>
  Probably you got that break by using the
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/breaks/\\"
    title=\\"Ancient Beeminder blog post from when we introduced this feature\\"
  >
    break scheduler
  </a>
  and if it&#8217;s still more than a week away, you can actually use it un-schedule a break too, by selecting the time period you want to unschedule, and changing the rate from 0 to &#8230; something.
That is admittedly kind of a fussy interface for saying &#8220;uh no, I don&#8217;t want that break after all&#8221;, and if the change is less than a week away, you can&#8217;t use it anyway.
(Yes, even though you&#8217;re not even making the road easier in this hypothetical world).
</p>
<p>
  In that case you&#8217;ll have to get rid of it using the

The prototype road editor functionality is super slick and awesome and amazing, but the interface is not exactly newbee friendly. (Yet!)

    my screencast
  </a>
  of removing a flat spot from my writing road using the road editor.
</p>
<p>
  A couple things to remember:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Switch to editor mode when you pick your graph
  </li>
  <li>
    Untick the &#8220;Fixed Slopes&#8221; before you delete the end of your flat spot
  </li>
  <li>
    Don&#8217;t panic! &#8212; there&#8217;s an undo button
  </li>
  <li>
    Nothing gets submitted to Beeminder until you click &#8220;Submit&#8221;
  </li>
  <li>
    (So click submit)
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  As long as the changes you make to the road don&#8217;t violate the pink zone (i.e. cause the graph to overlap that lightly pink-shaded zone), you&#8217;re good to go!
The interface will let you know loud and clear if your changes do violate that constraint, though.
And this is all happening in your browser; the changes aren&#8217;t sent to Beeminder unless you press the Submit button, so even if you make your graph go all wonky here in the road editor and everything turns red and sirens go off, it&#8217;s ok. 
You can just reload the page and we&#8217;ll never know!
</p>
<h2>
  Shortening flat spots
</h2>
<p>
  Another thing we were concerned about was the case of newbees setting up a goal with some initial safety buffer (the goal creation interface makes that easy) and then changing their minds about it and wanting to get started right away.
We didn&#8217;t want the answer to that case to be &#8220;go use this prototype road editor thing&#8221; since that&#8217;s still wholly too deep-Beeminder for a newbee.
You might also legitimately want to shorten a break for other reasons.
</p>
<p>
  So here is the compromise we came up with. 
If you are actually
  <em>
    on
  </em>
  a flat spot, you can shorten the flat spot.
But this only works with manual ratchets.
It&#8217;s not a built-in / automatic part of the ratchet algorithm, but actually uses a different method to adjust your safety buffer in this case.
We changed the form to alert you that something is different, and to be very explicit that what you are doing at this point is shortening a scheduled break.
</p>

  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
    Couldn&#8217;t we have strung together these two different types of ratcheting using ✨Programming Magic✨ so that flat spots would get automatically removed without you having to think about it?
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
    Yes&#8230; we could have but 
(1) we think it&#8217;s an improvement in 99% of ratchets to assume you really wanted that flat spot there, since aside from the newbee case, you don&#8217;t get a flat spot in a road without taking some kind of action.
And, (2) haven&#8217;t you been

      paying attention
    </a>
    around here? 
Trying to automatically adjust roads for you is fraught with potential pitfalls and weird corner cases depending on what values of the road are explicitly set by you, and which are inferred. 
It&#8217;s safer to make fewer assumptions and make you do more of the work.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
</div>
<br>
<p>
  To give you an example of this flat spot shortening business, I&#8217;ll be economical and also show you a case where you&#8217;d have to submit the form twice.
You&#8217;re just a little above the road, with a flat spot starting today.
The road has five days of buffer, and let us suppose that you would like to have two days remaining:
</p>
<img src=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-13-at-22.33.54.png\\">
<img src=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-13-at-22.27.45.png\\">
<p>
  If you put in a &#8220;2&#8221; and ratchet, here is what you&#8217;ll get:
</p>
<img src=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-13-at-22.28.48.png\\">
<img src=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-13-at-22.29.05.png\\">
<p>
  In addition to the super helpful banner telling you what&#8217;s up &#8212;
&#8220;Ratcheted as much as we could, but you are now on a break. Ratchet again to reduce the length of your break.&#8221; &#8212;
the ratchet section of the settings has changed to look like this:
</p>
<img src=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-13-at-23.11.28.png\\">
<p>
  Now if you change the buffer, we will slide the end of the flat spot over, reducing your break.
This is a little bit like the old ratchet where we moved the whole road in the x-direction to reduce your buffer, but in this case we are only moving the single segment that describes the flat spot, not the entirety of the future road:
</p>
<img src=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-13-at-22.29.47.png\\">
<p>
  Usually this won&#8217;t really be noticeable. 
The case where you would be most likely to notice is if you have segments that specify road values. 
(We are getting way into the weeds now.)
If the segment after the flat spot has a specific y-value specified then moving the beginning of the segment to be a day earlier will make that segment shallower.
If the segment after the flat spot has a specific end date and rate specified &#8212; the more common case &#8212; then moving the beginning of that segment to be a day earlier will make the segment end at a higher y-value.
In most cases you would never notice or care about that.
</p>
<p>
  Since we&#8217;re this far into the weeds, let me show you visually a couple cases where the results of a flat ratchet might seem odd. 
(None of them violate the akrasia horizon constraint, so we decided that they are ok.)
</p>
<h4>
  Case 1: the shifted segment gets less steep
</h4>
<p>
  Here is a road that&#8217;s got a segment after the flat spot that says &#8220;reach a value of 7 by the 19th&#8221;:
</p>
<img src=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-13-at-23.15.34.png\\">
<p>
  If you flat-ratchet this to two days, here&#8217;s what you get; a segment that reaches a value of 7 by the 19th&#8230;
</p>
<img src=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-13-at-23.16.03.png\\">
<p>
  &#8230;but since you started three days earlier, the segment is less steep. 
It now looks like it&#8217;s got almost the same rate as the following segment, but if you look closely, you&#8217;ll see that there is still a kink on the 19th, where it reaches a value of 7 and then the slope changes.
</p>
<h4>
  Case 2: weird shenanigans
</h4>
<p>
  If you have really particular stuff set up, you can even cause non-monotonic roads by a flat ratchet. 
But this is pretty unlikely.
Here&#8217;s an example though!
</p>
<p>
  I&#8217;ve set up this road so that it has two segments after the flat one.
It has a segment that increases at a rate of 1 until the 19th. 
That is followed by a segment that is effectively flat for three days, however it is specified as a Date + Value, saying &#8220;on the 22nd, be at a value of 4&#8221;:
</p>
<img src=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-13-at-23.19.20.png\\">
<p>
  Here&#8217;s the road matrix, for those of you following along at home:
</p>
<pre>
  <code>
    [[2020-10-09,    0, null],  (road starts on Oct 9 at a y-value of 0)
 [2020-10-14, null, 0.57],  (road slopes up at 0.57 per day until Oct 14)
 [2020-10-14,    3, null],  (road jumps to a y-value of 3 on Oct 14)
 [2020-10-18, null, 0   ],  (road is flat until Oct 18)
 [2020-10-19, null, 1   ],  (road slopes up at 1 per day until Oct 19)
 [2020-10-22,    4, null]]  (road goes to a y-value of 4 on Oct 22)
  </code>
</pre>
<p>
  Here&#8217;s what the road looks like after ratcheting to two days of buffer:
</p>
<img src=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-13-at-23.20.27.png\\">
<p>
  Are you starting to believe me now, that automatically changing roads for you is more complicated than you might initially think?
What happened here is perfectly logical, given how we represent and plot roads, and given how the road was specified.
The section that originally appeared as a second flat section, was in fact a direction to &#8220;continue from your starting point until you reach a value of 4 on the 22nd of October&#8221;.
In the original road it only happened to be flat because the original specification caused the previous segment to end at a value of 4.
When we scooched the starting point of that segment, which was specified as &#8220;increase at a rate of 1 per day&#8221;, instead of increasing for one day, it is now increasing for four days.
That causes the segment following it change from being a segment that goes from
  <em>
    four
  </em>
  to
  <em>
    four
  </em>
  in the course of three days, to one that goes from
  <em>
    seven
  </em>
  to
  <em>
    four
  </em>
  in three days.
Phew.
</p>
<p>
  (Side note: If there are any upcoming non-monotonicities in your road, the whole ratchet interface just says awhellno and links you to the road editor.)
</p>
<h2>
  Weekends-off doesn&#8217;t mean weekends are ignored
</h2>
<p>
  The two days that you are taking off for the weekend still count towards your safety buffer. 
So if you automatically cap your safety buffer, the auto-ratchet will eat some of your buffer when the weekend hits. 
That&#8217;s just Beeminder taking you literally when you say you want at most, e.g., two days of buffer and not treating weekends as a special case.
</p>
<p>
  Let us explain. 
Say you have auto-ratchet set to two days, with weekends-off. 
You&#8217;re skating the edge, like a normal Beeminder user, but on Thursday you go nuts and dispatch all your work for Thursday, Friday,
  <em>
    and
  </em>
  Monday. 
So now your next beemergency is Tuesday.
If you don&#8217;t count the weekend, you might think of that as three days of safety; you&#8217;re safe for Thursday (today), Friday, and Monday.
But Beeminder still counts the weekend, so from our point of view you&#8217;re safe for &#8230; Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday &#8230; five days!
</p>
<p>
  What then? 
Well, on Friday morning from your weekends-don&#8217;t-count point of view, you now have two days of buffer &#8212; but not really!
Beeminder sees four days and that&#8217;s more than you said you wanted so Beeminder ratchets the graph.
It won&#8217;t mess with your weekend so it can&#8217;t ratchet you to your specified two days &#8212; that would give you a Sunday beemergency &#8212; but it can ratchet you down to three, for a next beemergency day of Monday. 
So that&#8217;s what it does.
</p>
<p>
  More generally speaking, because the two flat days of your weekend still count in your safety buffer calculation, the most extra buffer that you can carry through the weekend (if you have your safety buffer automatically capped that is) is
  <code>
    Max Safety - 2
  </code>
  .
</p>
<hr>
<p>
  Ok, we covered a lot of ground here.
Regular ratchets, flat ratchets, prototype road editor, un-scheduling breaks with the break scheduler.
Of course the bottom line is that the yellow brick road is an arbitrary piecewise-linear function that you can edit to your heart&#8217;s delight with the road editor but also if your heart
  <em>
    doesn&#8217;t
  </em>
  delight you can tell Beeminder how much safety buffer to ratchet away and count on us to just do that.
&#8220;Just do that&#8221; is way easier said than done but we now do what we think is the best approximation to what you wanted, with what we think is a reasonable amount of transparency about the cases where we can&#8217;t.
</p>
<p>
  Hopefully it&#8217;s all much simpler to use in practice than it was to understand this blog post!
If it gives you any guff (frustration, confusion, wrongness, obtuseness, &#8230;) definitely let us know.

  My favorite answers to the &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t you just lie?&#8221; reaction are the inherent incentive to not ruin Beeminder&#8217;s efficacy, plus autodata.

  &#8221; which I think is the most fundamental counterargument.
Namely, that the whole notion of &#8220;paying money when you fail&#8221; is wrong.
As in, it is not in fact what happens on Beeminder.

If you have an ambitious goal then
  <em>
    of course
  </em>
  you will sometimes go off track.
If you never do then it wasn&#8217;t an ambitious goal.
It&#8217;s something you probably could&#8217;ve done without Beeminder and Beeminder isn&#8217;t really helping you.
The people whom Beeminder helps a life-changing amount, they definitely go off track sometimes.

  So they pay Beeminder sometimes and that is massively worth it to them.
It&#8217;s quite win-win.

  4. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t positive reinforcement better?&#8221;
</h2>
<p>
  We have yet another blog post laying out the reasons we think positive reinforcement isn&#8217;t all that:

    title=\\"TODO\\"

    Contra Positive Reinforcement: Why Beeminder Is A Glutton For Punishment
  </a>
  &#8221;.
But that makes us sound more pro-punishment than we are.
Most of our arguments are pragmatic.
Beeminder is not a charity and can&#8217;t literally reward you with money for staying on track towards your goals.

Imagine depositing money with Beeminder to pay for:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    the graphs and data
  </li>
  <li>
    the reminders
  </li>
  <li>
    the smartphone apps

    Readwise Reader
  </a>
  is a powerful tool for &#8220;power readers&#8221;. 
It&#8217;s like a supercharged read-it-later app, with first-class support for notes and highlights and tags. 
Now, you can keep track of your Readwise Reader items using Beeminder.
</p>
<p>
  You save things like web pages, PDFs, YouTube videos, Twitter threads, or aim it at an RSS feed or an email newsletter. 
It collects them all and makes them easy to read on their own. 
Web pages show just the juicy content you&#8217;re looking for. 
YouTube videos are shown alongside their transcript, for example, and the transcript highlights as the words are spoken in the video. 
You can click on a line in the transcript to jump right to it. 
Of course, it wouldn&#8217;t be a good read-it-later app if it didn&#8217;t save your progress in the video (or anything else you use Readwise Reader for).
</p>
<p>
  As awesome as Readwise Reader is, it&#8217;s no surprise that some folks go into a &#8220;read-it-later&#8221; frenzy. 
The save rate tends to be higher than the read rate, and that pile accumulates&#8230; 
I&#8217;d show you some good quotes about this problem, but they&#8217;re somewhere in my later pile. 
We recently got a note from the Readwise Reader folks that they added some API endpoints for fetching items that are already in your account. 
Readwise Reader has been sitting near the top of the candidate autodata integration list for a while &#8212; and folks have loved our

  for a while, and Adam&#8217;s Readwise Reader had gotten a little overwhelming&#8230;
</p>
<h2>
  How does it work?
</h2>
<p>
  You set a limit for a Readwise Reader location, like Inbox, Later, or Shortlist. 
If you&#8217;re already under the limit, great! 
You&#8217;ll have to stay under the limit each day or pay a penalty. 
If you&#8217;re currently over that limit, Beeminder will set up a goal to get you down to that limit, and then stay under it.
</p>
<p>
  If you want to adjust how long it&#8217;ll take to get to your limit, you can do that once the goal is created.

Assuming you’re on board with the commitment device, paying-money-if-you-go-off-track bit, the beauty of an autodata integration is that you don’t normally need to interact with Beeminder once you’ve gone through the process above of setting up your commitment. 
Just work through your items, either deleting them, archiving them, or otherwise moving them out of the location (your Inbox or Later or Shortlist) when Beeminder yells at you and you’re good.

    Weasel article
  </a>
  , 
when we formulated a theory of weaseliness and concluded that Beeminders are second-degree weasels.
We (Beeminder users, including ourselves) are surprisingly
  <em>
    non
  </em>
  -weasely in many ways.
It turned out that the entirety of the
  <a href=\\"http://beeminder.com/contract\\">
    Beeminder commitment contract
  </a>
  and
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/sos\\">
    SOS clause
  </a>
  can be replaced with &#8220;keep your dots on the road; talk to us if there was a problem&#8221;.
</p>
<p>
  Beeminders are, however, weasels of omission.
Which brings us to the Third Great Beeminder Epiphany:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    <strong>
      Be very lenient about proactive weaseling and very strict about passive weaseling.
    </strong>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  In other words, if you have to take specific action (like reply to an email) to weasel out of a commitment, no problem. We&#8217;ll just believe you.
But if you can effectively get yourself off the hook through pure inaction, that&#8217;s a disaster.
It&#8217;s not a huge epiphany for those who&#8217;ve read
  <a href=\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_(book)\\">

  &#8212; 
we want continued awesomeness to be the path of least resistance &#8212; 
but, like the

  >
    akrasia horizon
  </a>
  , it was a hard-won insight, despite being obvious in retrospect.
</p>
<p>
  Our latest manifestation of that principle is a new feature called&#8230;
</p>
<h2>
  Precommit To Recommit
</h2>
<p>
  How it works is dirt simple: check the precommit-to-recommit box above your graph and your yellow brick road will automatically rerail if you derail.
</p>
<p>
  <img
    class=\\"aligncenter\\"
    alt=\\"Screenshot of precommit-to-recommit checkbox\\"
    title=\\"Google 'beeminder one must-do' if you're curious what goal this is from\\"
    src=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/b_mustdo-1.jpg\\"
  >
</p>
<p>
  If you&#8217;re at all nervous about touching that checkbox, here&#8217;s why you shouldn&#8217;t be:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    You can check or uncheck the box at any time, even seconds before you&#8217;re about to derail &#8212; no
    <a
      href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/dial\\"
      title=\\"The akrasia horizon refers to the constraint that you can&#39;t change anything about your goal, like the steepness of the yellow brick road, in the coming week, i.e., all changes have a one week delay\\"
    >
      akrasia horizon
    </a>
    limitations.
  </li>
  <li>
    It rerails you with a week of flat spot so you can get yourself back off the hook even after the auto-rerail happens by flattening your road again the same day.
    <a
      class=\\"footnote\\"
      id=\\"MER1\\"
      href=\\"#MER\\"
    >
      [2]
    </a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Although by default you&#8217;re bumped up to the next pledge level, you can drop back down to your previous level. Yes, that takes a week, but you&#8217;re flat for that week so there isn&#8217;t much risk of paying the higher pledge during that week. UPDATE: You can now also choose
    <em>
      not
    </em>
    to be automatically bumped up to the next pledge level.
  </li>
  <li>
    You still get the legitimacy check email when you derail and can cry foul if anything went wrong. The email just also informs you that you&#8217;re back on the hook already if you do nothing.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  UPDATE: We added one more safety net&#8230;
</p>
<ol start=\\"5\\">
  <li>
    As with our
    <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/autocancel\\">
      auto-canceling subscriptions
    </a>
    , if you stop using Beeminder altogether then all your precommit-to-recommit checkboxes will automatically uncheck themselves.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Now you might be wondering what the point of it is at all, if it&#8217;s that toothless.
We can answer with one (convoluted neologism of a) word:
  <strong>
    anti-cranial-silicosis
  </strong>
  .
That is, keeping people from putting their heads in the sand and procrastinating indefinitely on getting back on the wagon after they derail.
</p>
<p>
  For the kind of person who needs Beeminder &#8212; and let us tell you, we know this type inside and out &#8212; this is a big deal.
You intend to rerail, of course, just that &#8220;next week&#8221; should be a better time.
Well, we&#8217;ve now automated that problem away.
</p>
<p>
  This may look like a devious scheme to multiply our revenue, and it is, but even more importantly, true

  Remember back in the day (yesterday) when Beeminder&#8217;s interface was all cluttered and intimidating and looked like it was made in 2011, by kernel hackers and accountants? 
Or computer scientists and behavioral econ nerds who gradually agglomerated a multiheaded beast of a system to implement their crazy lifehacking schemes.
Beeminder gave the impression that you needed to read our almost 6 years of blog posts in order to get started.
Which, aside from being bad for getting newbees to dive in, lead to emails like this one from a superfan:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    &#8220;I want to share Beeminder with all my friends but every time I introduce it to someone they never get past the first few pages. 
I even tried showing it to my mum, who has the most to benefit from it, but I will never forget the look of panic on her face.&#8221;

    title=\\"Josh&#39;s personal page. You should hire him!\\"
  >
    Josh Pitzalis
  </a>
  ,
who proceeded to offer his services as a web designer.
We think being a hardcore Beeminder user is such a good predictor of general awesomeness that we pretty much jumped on the chance to hire him then and there.
He also was starting with the huge advantage of already understanding much of the functionality. 
Josh was wonderfully thoughtful about the tradeoffs (newbees vs power users) and did many user tests to single out problem areas in the old design, and to test out the mockups of the new design.
</p>
<h3>
  Some Stats

  We started work on this 6 months ago, with Josh starting in on designs in late March.

  , bringing Josh&#8217;s vision to fruition.
The redesign comprised 846 commits and
  <a
    href=\\"https://trello.com/b/Quw3lqbb/beeflat\\"
    title=\\"Trello board just for this redesign\\"
  >
    385 completed Trello cards
  </a>
  (with 39 more tagged &#8220;to do asap after launching&#8221; and 35 in &#8220;still discussing&#8221;).
It took over 550 hours of time, 100 from Josh, and at least 450 from Andy. 
Danny and Bethany failed to separate out time spent specifically on the redesign but it was some hundreds of more hours.
That also doesn&#8217;t include all the time spent by intrepid users testing things out for us and submitting bug reports (thanks so much!).
Possibly our favorite stat, though, is that Andy&#8217;s net contribution was -210 lines of code.

<h3>
  New Features
</h3>
<p>
  We actually tried to minimize the new features that were rolled into this redesign.
The idea was to drastically improve the aesthetics and the interface without messing up any functionality.
The changes were so extensive that a lot of things broke (and were fixed again &#8212; thank you beeta testers!) along the way.
Every new feature bundled in with all that would mean combinatorially more complexity and ways for things to break.
</p>
<p>
  But here&#8217;s what ended up functionally different:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      We expect most people to live in their dashboard, which is now what you see if you&#8217;re logged in and go to beeminder.com/username.
The gallery is still available too and is what&#8217;s shown to people not logged in.
There a bunch of changes in the dashboard &#8212; mostly fitting more information and controls in so you don&#8217;t normally need to leave to enter new data or see what you still need to do.
Maybe the slickest new feature is the expanding and collapsing goals.
Pro tip: Use it like a to-do list by expanding the goals you want to work and then collapsing them throughout the day as you get enough done.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The Data tab is so much nicer! It lets you load all the datapoints on one page, sort by any column, and you can edit datapoints in place.
And all of that is now right below the graph.
Also below the data are import/export and data rescaling.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Account deletion.

Specifically, you can delete your account with a button press if it&#8217;s less than a week old or you have no active goals.
After that you have to talk to us.
That&#8217;s the current compromise, since Beeminder, after all, is all about getting yourself firmly on the hook.

      This is a minor one that&#8217;s more about the UI than new functionality but we think it&#8217;s important to always be acutely aware of not only the amount of money you have at risk but how much is going to be at risk in the future.
So now when your pledge is scheduled to drop down, that&#8217;s displayed very clearly above the graph, and when you&#8217;ve hit your pledge cap, that&#8217;s indicated with an asterisk.
We find this matters a lot for our own goals because hitting your pledge cap without noticing means you can get stuck at a pledge below your

<h3>
  Lost Features
</h3>
<p>
  We went to pretty heroic lengths to not lose any features or functionality or make things worse for our hardcore superfans.
If you have counterexamples, we very much want to hear!
But we did decide to axe a few things:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Auto-quit. Years ago, when we switched to
      <a
        href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/nwo\\"
        title=\\"New World Order -- we can be a little dramatic sometimes\\"
      >
        automatically recommitting you
      </a>
      and putting you back on the yellow brick road when you derail, we added a feature to opt out of that and just have your graph freeze if you derailed.
That was called auto-quit and it violated every principle of behaviorial economics that Beeminder is based on.
Now that it&#8217;s a distant memory that Beeminder ever behaved differently we decided to kill that feature.
(With grandfathering of existing goals of course.)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Backburnering. This feature was confusing and even dangerous because it could leave beemergencies hidden from view.
Also it was a very crude way to organize your goals.
Now that we have (a rudimentary) way to tag goals and filter by tag, we decided it was safe to kill this feature.
If you just want backburnering, tag those goals &#8220;backburner&#8221; and then append
      <code>
        #!backburner
      </code>
      to the URL when viewing your dashboard (and perhaps bookmark that version).
Also you can now instantly delete things from your gallery of archived goals (another new feature we didn&#8217;t mention) which means you can use your archive for things you don&#8217;t care about but still want to keep around without being cluttered with things you really want totally gone.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Sort threshold. This one is too obtuse and obscure to even describe but it was another way to organize your dashboard and we&#8217;re hoping that tagging will subsume it!
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>

That&#8217;s why typically a better metric of progress is to sum up additions &amp; deletions, and get the gross line changes, not the net.
That was over 16,000 lines of code in 453 files.

  There&#8217;s a super obvious fact of fluid dynamics that I tend to delude myself about when, instead of fluids in pipes and reservoirs, it&#8217;s things like emails in my inbox.
Let me state the email version of it:
Consider the subset of incoming emails that you truly must deal with.
If those urgent/important emails enter your inbox at an average rate higher than the average rate you deal with them, then you are super screwed.
</p>
<div style=\\"border-style:solid;border-width:1px;padding:10px 70px 20px\\">

Or ham from spam, if we&#8217;re talking about email.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
    In fact, in the illustration above where emails are drops of water, imagine that the only emails flowing in are ones that you&#8217;ll hate yourself for ignoring.
Emails for which the only reason you&#8217;d fail to deal with them would be egregious

  </p>

  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
    Most systems that purport to keep you on top of your email focus on the efficiency of sorting and replying to it.
Automatic filters,

    >

    </a>
    ,
canned replies, etc, etc.
Those are all nice but miss the fundamental problem:
the messages you must deal with arriving faster than you deal with them.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
</div>
<p>
  I think it&#8217;s really hard to appreciate how super screwed you are because you&#8217;re collecting everything in a backlog (probably your inbox itself but it doesn&#8217;t matter where) and you think you&#8217;ll catch up.
And if periods when a backlog accumulates are rare and you isolate the backlog and beemind it then, yes, you can catch up.
But if they&#8217;re not rare then you are crashing into this stubborn fact of fluid dynamics and your backlog will grow without bound.
</p>
<h2>
  No Such Thing as Inbox Nonzero
</h2>
<p>
  We all know about
  <a
    href=\\"http://messymatters.com/email/\\"
    title=\\"If you want to hear my explanation from 9 years ago\\"
  >
    Inbox Zero
  </a>
  : Your inbox is only for things you haven&#8217;t looked at yet and when you do look at your inbox, you should do something with every message and get it out of there.
Not maintaining Inbox Zero inevitably devolves into Inbox River.
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"JL1\\"
    href=\\"#JL\\"
  >
    [1]
  </a>
  As email flows by, you grab things that are important enough to notice.
If you don&#8217;t, the river empties into a vast sea where everything is out of sight, out of mind and you have little hope of remembering to fish anything out.
Knowing that every email is now-or-never, you&#8217;re pretty incentivized to grab the truly important things as they flow by.
</p>
<p>
  To make Inbox River work, you better only check email when you have enough time devoted to actually deal with everything that might have appeared since you last checked.
That&#8217;s the point of Inbox River: everything else must flow by.
But then what&#8217;s the fundamental difference between Inbox River and Inbox Zero?
It&#8217;s just a question of whether you explicitly archive the things you&#8217;re not going to deal with or archive them implicitly, by letting them flow by.
</p>
<p>
  Maybe the implicit version is psychologically useful for some people, I don&#8217;t know.
The way it would play out for me is I&#8217;d end up jotting down on a to-do list or somewhere all the critical things that were flowing by in the river that definitely have to be dealt with but are too ugh-y to deal with
  <em>
    now
  </em>
  .
And then that to-do list would be the new place for tasks to go to die, for the same fluid dynamical reason:
adding things faster than you remove them.
</p>
<h2>
  Redqueening
</h2>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;The incoming stream must not feed the backlog!&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  Redqueening means running as fast as you can just to stay in one place.
It&#8217;s from Alice Through the Looking Glass. 
More generally it means not falling behind, processing things at the same average rate they arrive.
</p>
<p>
  The key insight is that the incoming stream must not feed the backlog.
If it does then you&#8217;re not getting the real-time feedback on whether you&#8217;re escaping that hard fact of fluid dynamics. 
It has to be obvious to you as you process incoming tasks that on most days and most weeks, you&#8217;re dispatching the important items at exactly the same average rate that they appear.
The best way to do that is to always hit Inbox Zero, or whatever your equivalent of that is, every time you look at the incoming stream.
So any amount of batching is fine but you have to process everything every time you process a batch.
</p>
<p>
  And that&#8217;s it.
I fear that this will all sound silly and wrong to those who need to internalize it and will be vacuous platitudes to those who don&#8217;t.
But it&#8217;s been helpful for me to articulate it at least.
I&#8217;m still fairly terrible with email but gradually getting less so.
Even without often hitting Inbox Zero, it&#8217;s helpful for me to remind myself that at the end of the day my inbox needs to be back to the size it was the previous day.
And that I can isolate and beemind a backlog for special occasions like vacations but doing it routinely or randomly, out of procastination, means an inexorable overflowing cauldron of communications calamity.
</p>
<h2>
  UPDATE: Practical Addendum and Straw Poll
</h2>
<p>
  One practical aspect of this is psychological.
You need a nice clean slate, with a backlog tucked away that you can chip away at nice and gradually.
Then you can focus on redqueening &#8212; keeping the slate nice and clean.
</p>
<p>
  Here&#8217;s an example of a redqueening strategy:
Decide how much time is acceptable to spend on email and spend that much time per day grabbing the most important things that have arrived since yesterday.
When time runs out you wrest the keyboard from your hand, Dr Strangelove style, and archive the rest.
</p>
<p>
  The insight I&#8217;m groping towards is that
  <em>
    every
  </em>
  possible email / triage / to-do list system is similar to a redqueening strategy like that.
Some subset of the inflow you actually deal with and the rest is culled. 
The key is to have a system that maximizes the intentionality of that subset.
If it&#8217;s sufficiently intentional then you can call it &#8220;dealing with&#8221; everything.
Archiving and taking no action on a thing counts as dealing with it!
Failing to redqueen, on the other hand, means having a subset randomly culled because it flowed indiscriminately into a boundless sea.
</p>
<p>
  Thanks to all the daily beemail recipients for helping me articulate this!
I also gave them this straw poll:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    (a) I&#8217;m nodding along but won&#8217;t do anything differently
  </li>
  <li>
    (b) This is all wrong, at least for me
  </li>
  <li>
    (c) I&#8217;m off to isolate my backlog right now!
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The responses: 3 a&#8217;s, 1 b, 3 c&#8217;s, and 4 none-of-the-aboves.
That&#8217;s enough for me to call this post a success!

  Alerts and nudges about your goal are fundamental to our contract with you, the user, to do our very best to help you meet the goals you&#8217;ve set, and only take your money as a last resort. 
So much so that if we screw up the alerts and you don&#8217;t meet your goal, we cancel the derailment and give you your money back.
</p>
<p>
  But the state of Beeminder alerts until now was suboptimal in a lot of ways. 
Common complaints included:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    too many emails
  </li>
  <li>
    I only want to get alerted when the goal&#8217;s about to derail
  </li>
  <li>
    why are there so many settings?
  </li>
  <li>
    wait, how do I just get alerted when the goal&#8217;s about to derail?
  </li>
  <li>
    can I get a summary email?
  </li>
  <li>
    it&#8217;s so annoying that I have to remember to change the settings for every new goal
  </li>
  <li>
    and myriad other things&#8230;
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  We&#8217;re happy to announce that we&#8217;ve fixed most of them!
</p>
<h2>
  Simplified Settings
</h2>
<p>
  A picture being worth a thousand words, let us show what just happened with reminder settings.
We went from this:

  >
</p>
<p>
  So much has been accomplished here!
The horribly convoluted box-checking required to get only emergency day (eep day) reminders is gone.
In fact, getting only eep reminders is now the default.
So that&#8217;s drastically less mail that newbees who don&#8217;t venture into settings will get.
(And it was even worse before: there was no way to get just emergency reminders without also getting wrong lane reminders.)
</p>
<p>
  Fundamentally there are now just three parameters affecting how Beeminder bugs you about a goal:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Time of day to remind you (or start relentlessly reminding you, if it&#8217;s an emergency day)
  </li>
  <li>
    How many days before the beemergency to start reminding you (default 0, max 30)
  </li>
  <li>
    The

      title=\\"Blog post announcing our arbitrary deadlines feature\\"

      deadline
    </a>
    &#8212; 
when the goal will derail if you don&#8217;t do what you committed to do
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  We&#8217;re pretty paranoid about retrogressing, even in small ways, so let&#8217;s talk about what we&#8217;ve given up.
It&#8217;s not much!
</p>
<h3>
  What if I don&#8217;t want the bot to bug me on weekends?
</h3>
<p>
  Yes, you used to be able to specify days of the week.
But, confusingly, they would be ignored if you were in the wrong lane or in the red anyway.
Now everything centers around the derailment.
If you don&#8217;t want to be bugged on the weekend then make sure you have enough safety buffer.
</p>
<h3>
  How do I turn off
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/zeno/\\"
    title=\\"Zeno polling means you get reminded ever more persistently on emergency days. Why this is named after an ancient Greek philosopher is left as an exercise for the read. (Nerds: Yes, it&#39;s exactly what you&#39;re thinking.)\\"

    Zeno Polling
  </a>
  ?
</h3>
<p>
  Make your reminder time be 1 minute before your deadline, or set your number of days lead time for getting reminders to -1.
We think the right way to stop Zeno polling is to dispatch your dang-diggity beemergency (i.e., get back on the yellow brick road) and if you disagree we want you to prove you&#8217;ve thought about it!
</p>
<p>
  But mostly our answer is: don&#8217;t. 
Zeno polling is brilliant.
And if we&#8217;re about to take your money we
  <em>
    really should
  </em>
  tell you about it.

<h3>
  I have to pay for the SMS bot now?
</h3>
<p>
  After convincing ourselves that Zeno polling is the bees&#8217; knees we decided that the SMS bot really needed to get with the program and do it too.
And since sending text messages costs us money, we decided it should be a
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/premium\\"
    title=\\"Blog post about our premium plans. The cheapest one suffices for the SMS bot.\\"
  >
    premium
  </a>
  feature.
Those of you who were already using the SMS bot before we announced this got grandfathered.
</p>
<p>
  We should also mention that our Android app already implements Zeno polling and we think you&#8217;ll like that better than the SMS bot.
Our iPhone app will get Zeno polling as soon as possible.
</p>
<h3>
  What if I want to use the SMS bot for some goals and the email bot for others?
</h3>
<p>
  We looked at how people were already using the SMS bot, and we doubt that anyone cares strongly about this.
But if you do, please complain to us in the comments, describe your
  <a
    href=\\"https://xkcd.com/1172/\\"
    title=\\"XKCD on breaking someone&#39;s workflow\\"

  </a>
  , 
and you might get your wish.
</p>
<h3>
  What if I want reminders every day even if I&#8217;m more than 30 days from derailing?
</h3>
<p>
  Dial up your road!
A Beeminder graph where you&#8217;re entering data daily yet has greater than 30 days of safety buffer is not really beeminding. 
Having months of safety buffer may make sense for some goals but it should mean you have months before you need to think about it.
Daily reminders would be overkill in that case.
</p>
<h2>
  Goal Defaults
</h2>
<p>
  The other big thing that&#8217;s new, aside from drastically simplified alert settings, is goal defaults.
</p>
<p>
  If you&#8217;ve created more than one or two Beeminder goals, it&#8217;s likely you&#8217;ve noticed that you have some preferred goal settings, and maybe it&#8217;s annoying to go in and change them with every new goal you create. 
Maybe you&#8217;ve subscribed to
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/premium/#planbee\\"
    title=\\"The Plan Bee section of the blog post about premium plans\\"
  >
    Plan Bee
  </a>
  so that you can just always keep your pledges at $0, or maybe you&#8217;re really intense and want every goal to do the
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/glossary/#n\\"
    title=\\"In short -- rerail with no break\\"
  >
    No-Mercy Recommit
  </a>
  , or you&#8217;re a night owl and want all of your goals to have their deadlines set for 4am.
</p>
<p>
  Now you can find the defaults in your account settings (link in the upper right of the yellow Beeminder banner).
In addition to defaults for the alert settings, you can control a few of the settings around the goal&#8217;s derail behavior: 
the deadline, the pledge cap, and whether or not to get a break for a week after falling off the wagon.
There might be other settings that make sense to include as defaults. 
If there&#8217;s something we&#8217;ve left out that seems important to you, let us know in the comments!
</p>
<h3>
  But I have 38 different goals and don&#8217;t want them to have the same settings!
</h3>
<p>
  Don&#8217;t worry, we haven&#8217;t taken away individual goal settings. 
You can toggle whether or not a particular goal inherits the defaults. So set the defaults to whatever makes sense for you, and adjust as necessary on an individual basis.
If you update the default settings they get applied to all the default goals. So you can also use this to make mass updates to a bunch of your goals at once, rather than clicking through to each individual goal page, then to settings, etc.
</p>

In fact, it&#8217;s because reminders have been there from the very beginning &#8212; the days-of-the-week feature literally predated the concept of derailments &#8212; that we backed ourselves into a corner design- and UI-wise, requiring this elaborate blog post to describe how we finally extricated ourselves and made reminders sane again.

He&#8217;s going to get a head start on 2013, and so could you.  Here&#8217;s how.
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  It&#8217;s approaching that time of year again.
People will ask you about your resolutions for the new year.
They might even ask whether you&#8217;re going to stick to them this year.
You&#8217;ll have to do the thinking for yourself

    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"BEEKEEPER1\\"

Beeminder can help with that.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;Beeminder puts you in control of what it means to be successful&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  Beeminder puts you in control of what it means to be successful, all the while reminding you to make progress towards your goal.
Even better, when you first create a goal, you can ask it not to push you in the first week.
That means that you can set up resolution-related goals in the post-Christmas lull, confident that they won&#8217;t really come into force until the new year.
</p>
<p>
  It also means that you won&#8217;t have to worry about wussing out when you&#8217;re nursing a hangover.
You won&#8217;t have arguments with your friends about when the new year
  <em>
    really
  </em>
  starts, because you&#8217;re already on your
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/roadwidth\\">
    yellow brick road
  </a>
  .
Stay on that road, and you can claim victory, because you&#8217;ve successfully stuck to the contract, and you can
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/dial\\">
    adjust that agreement
  </a>
  throughout the year.
</p>
<p>
  Even if this has been a truly awful year so far, you&#8217;ll still be able to call it a raging success if you put support systems in place for next year.

  Get the Jump on your Gym Membership
</h2>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;Beeminder makes sure that I sustain my resolve throughout the year&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  I joined a gym last month, and like everyone who signs up for a gym membership, I told myself that I would use it often.
My twin motivations?
To increase my general fitness, and to not waste the money.
I&#8217;m confident that I&#8217;ll succeed at both.
</p>
<p>
  Here&#8217;s why: I took my monthly gym membership
  <em>
    (£70)
  </em>
  , thought about the absolute most I&#8217;d want to pay per visit
  <em>
    (£10)
  </em>
  , and set myself a Beeminder slope of that number of visits per month
  <em>
    (£70 / £10 = 7)
  </em>
  .
If I stay above my road by going to the gym at least that many times each month, then my per-visit cost will be less than my maximum, and I&#8217;ll reap the physical benefits.

<p>
  If you&#8217;re like me, you don&#8217;t always know what is going to be important throughout the year.
I&#8217;m certainly coming out of 2012 having accomplished amazing things that wouldn&#8217;t even have made the list.
That means that I&#8217;m likely to go into 2013 not knowing enough about the amazement that awaits my future self.
How do you set goals for that?
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;I can be certain of making tangible progress every single day&#8221;

<p>
  One idea was eloquently described by Alice Harris in her blog post about having
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/mustdo/\\">
    one must-do task every day
  </a>
  .
The beauty of Alice&#8217;s approach is that you can vary the difficulty or direction of the task day by day, and still be sure that you&#8217;re making progress.
That&#8217;s the way that the Beeminder folks ensure that the experience of using
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/blogdog/\\">
    Beeminder keeps improving
  </a>
  .
Each and every day (on average) there&#8217;s visible tangible progress.
</p>
<p>
  Another suggestion is to keep tabs on a process you already care about.
Whether you&#8217;re a fan of
  <a href=\\"http://www.davidco.com/about-gtd\\">
    David Allen&#8217;s GTD
  </a>
  or

  Beeminder won&#8217;t replace your other productivity tools, but it can help you ensure that you remember to do a
  <a href=\\"http://zenhabits.net/how-to-do-weekly-review-in-under-hour/\\">
    weekly review
  </a>
  .
I&#8217;ve also made good use of a goal that tracked how many cycles of Mark&#8217;s FV system I successfully completed.
</p>
<p>
  I&#8217;m sure that you can think of other meta-goals that don&#8217;t need you to be too specific in advance, but that will help you keep on track next year.

    Dave Seah&#8217;s philosophy

Set yourself a couple of Beeminder-fueled trials that end on groundhog day.

  applies the doctrine to procrastination and time management thusly:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    All people are equally good at time management, but some people are more willing than others to admit that they are doing what they want to do, while others maintain the illusion they wish they were doing something else.

  >
    tears that apart in detail
  </a>
  .
In particular he points out the distinction between &#8220;doing what you&#8217;re motivated to do&#8221; and &#8220;acting in your own self-interest&#8221;.
</p>
<p>
  Here&#8217;s a more concise reductio proof: 
People use commitment devices; therefore by revealed preference their preferences don&#8217;t match their actions. QED.
</p>
<p>
  In other words, my use of a commitment device proves (by the orthodox economists&#8217; own criterion) that I really do wish to be doing something else.
</p>
<p>
  For any real economists in the audience I should point out that I&#8217;m being a little glib here.
I do want to pile on with Will Wilkinson against Tyler Cowen but I&#8217;m not really trying to debunk Nobel prize winning economist Paul Samuelson who pioneered revealed preference in consumer theory.
In fact, when Beeminder is sufficiently mainstream then the doctrine becomes perfectly reasonable:
Whatever you&#8217;re doing, with the help of Beeminder

  Here&#8217;s an obvious principle of personal finance: 
If you can spend $100 now to prevent spending $200 next year, definitely do that.
</p>
<p>
  But in startup finance, it can totally make sense to decide to pay the $200 next year. 
Because your business is growing exponentially and $200 next year may easily be less expensive to you than $100 now. 
Both because you expect to be richer and because if those $100 expenses add up to enough distraction that your business stops existing then the $100 expenses were actually pure waste.
</p>
<p>
  This is why you hear non-sarcastic financial advice to brand-new startups like &#8220;just put all your receipts in a shoebox and worry about it later&#8221;.
When there&#8217;s a ton of uncertainty about getting off the ground at all then that actually makes sense.
Put no effort into things that only matter
  <em>
    if
  </em>
  you get off the ground.

<p>
  Beeminder by  now is a lifestyle business more than a startup so it&#8217;s closer to the personal finance principle than the startup version. 
But it&#8217;s still on the spectrum and things that would be no-brainers for personal finance are yes-brainers for us.
</p>
<p>
  This is worth keeping in mind when being all prudent about your business accounting and taxes and things.
It might be optimal to be less prudent than you&#8217;re naturally inclined to be.
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"WORRY1\\"
    href=\\"#WORRY\\"

    [1]
  </a>
  Keep much of your focus on growth even at the expense of letting accounting problems compound in their risk of future ass-biting.
</p>
<p>
  Summing that up: humans, being mortal, should discount the future at maybe 5% per year (1%? 10%? let&#8217;s say single digits or at most low double digits).
A grow-or-die startup should have a huge discount rate, way over 100%, like where anything a couple years out is totally irrelevant. 
Other businesses should be in between.
</p>
<h3>
  What does Beeminder&#8217;s growth imply about its discount rate?
</h3>
<p>
  Well, we need to be growing faster than we are.
Arguably we should quit if we don&#8217;t grow, since we&#8217;re not quite making market salaries.
 
Which means spending money now to save money next year might be genuinely wasteful.
Because next year we should either be richer or dead. 
Wide-eyed emoji!
</p>
<p>
  (Don&#8217;t worry, we have zero inclination to walk away from Beeminder.
We previously made a grow-or-die commitment device and it worked but was scary and stressful so we&#8217;re thinking about how to force ourselves to spur growth without doing that.
We&#8217;re quite sanguine about this.
We&#8217;re Beeminder users after all.)
</p>
<p>
  But for the outside view on how long Beeminder will be around, the answer is, as of late 2023, another 12 years, per the
  <a
    href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect\\"
    title=\\"The heuristic is: in the absence of phenomena like senescence (reasonable for non-perishable things like companies) expect future lifespan to equal lifespan so far\\"
  >
    Lindy effect
  </a>
  .
Or another 16 years, depending how you count.
Again, the inside view yields an estimate of infinity years!
</p>
<p>
  We can even use the Lindy effect to turn all this into a concrete heuristic.
Pick a discount rate such that things at your Lindy horizon &#8212; 
namely, again as long into the future as you&#8217;ve existed in the past &#8212;
matter half as much as things today.
The formula for that is 
log(2)/x where x
 
is your Lindy horizon.
If you&#8217;re 1 year old, use a discount rate of 69% per year.
If you&#8217;re 8 years old, use 9% per year.
Then just take market rates as a floor on that, implying that once you&#8217;re our age you can stop doing any extra future discounting based on your limited expected lifespan.

  There&#8217;s something a little weird for me, intuitively, about beeminding parts of my spiritual life.
After all,
  <a
    href=\\"http://biblehub.com/romans/12-19.htm\\"
    title=\\"“Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.”\\"
  >
    in Romans 12:19
  </a>
  , 
it is written &#8220;Vengeance
  <em>
    is
  </em>
  mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.&#8221;
So, if I turn to Beeminder to keep track of my prayer practices, am I introducing an unnecessary (or worse yet, idolatrous!) enforcement middleman?
</p>
<p>
  Prayer is supposed to come from the heart, so is there something weird about graphing it and setting up my own penalties if I don&#8217;t measure up?
</p>
<p>
  My answer is, yes, it&#8217;s a bit weird, but so is
  <em>
    most
  </em>
  of my prayer life.
I&#8217;m a convert, so I&#8217;ve had to pick up prayer as a second language, but, even for people who are raised religious, spiritual life is a process of growth, which means it tends to include a lot of awkward stages.
I&#8217;ve found it useful to &#8220;cheat&#8221; a number of ways in my prayer life, from seeking out opportunities to pray in community (where I feel more natural and less self-conscious) to praying while walking on my commute (the one reliable fixed point in my schedule).
Beeminder is one of a number of hacks I&#8217;ve used to help me get over initial resistance to a new ritual or habit.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;I would be teed off at God for my own poor planning.&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  Beeminder carries some particular pitfalls, though.
Any time I set up a pledge, if I wind up resenting the little reminders I get from the Beeminder Bot, I don&#8217;t want to &#8220;solve&#8221; my problem by just upping my pledge until the pain of the monetary loss exceeds the pain of keeping my promise.
When I pull that kind of trick, I wind up feeling angry at Beeminder and myself (much like the employee of a boss who thinks &#8216;motivation&#8217; consists of &#8220;Do it in half the time, or you&#8217;re fired&#8221;).
So my biggest concern wouldn&#8217;t be using Beeminder to &#8220;cheat&#8221; and pray when I wouldn&#8217;t have natually &#8212; it would be using it to commit to something I wasn&#8217;t ready for, and then being teed off at God for my own poor planning.
</p>
<p>
  That&#8217;s why I think Beeminder works best for habits I&#8217;ve tried out before, that I know are worth the effort.
For me, that might be something like
  <em>
    <a
      href=\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lectio_Divina\\"
      title=\\"Latin for “divine reading”\\"
    >
      lectio divina
    </a>
  </em>
  (a special practice of spiritual reading and meditation).
When I
  <em>
    do
  </em>
  do
  <em>
    lectio divina
  </em>
  , I tend to get a lot out of it, but I&#8217;m not very good at making time for it.
It feels like something I&#8217;m doing for myself, whose timing is more flexible than socializing, work, laundry, etc, so it always winds up getting short shrift.
Beeminding a period of
  <em>
    lectio
  </em>
  each week wouldn&#8217;t wind up
  <em>
    forcing
  </em>
  me to make time for this reading &#8212; it would
  <em>
    permit
  </em>
  me to, because now it wouldn&#8217;t feel like
  <em>
    lectio
  </em>
  always had to yield before other scheduling commitments.

  (This strategy worked

Before I started using Beeminder, I had trouble exiting late night conversations, but &#8220;Sorry, I have to log off or Beeminder will charge me $5&#8221; tended to satisfy all my friends.)
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;Beeminder wouldn&#8217;t wind up
  <strong>
    forcing
  </strong>
  me, it would
  <strong>
    permit
  </strong>
  me.&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  Ultimately, I don&#8217;t feel any worse about using Beeminder to stay on track with a prayer practice than I do about the period in which I was using Remember the Milk (RTM) to send me little reminders to talk to my brother periodically.
It would sure be preferable to be the kind of person who had the impulse to reach out to God (or my brother)
  <em>
    naturally
  </em>
  , because it was so much a part of me that the impulse rose as unconsciously as hunger, that it was the lack of communication, not the performance of it, that felt unnatural.
</p>
<p>
  And that may well wind up happening, but, if it does, I expect it will be partly because I used Beeminder and other automated tools to help me

    title=\\"Yay chemistry metaphors!\\"
  >

After all, beeminded prayer practices, like RTM-instigated phone calls, just force me to make
  <em>
    time
  </em>
  for a conversation.
What I wind up saying to God is still (gulp) up to me.

    road dial
  </a>
  was one of the first Beeminder features, announced almost 5 years ago when we were still in private beta.
It lets you adjust the steepness of your yellow brick road &#8212; how much you&#8217;ve committed to doing &#8212; with a one-week delay.
For most people most of the time, that&#8217;s all you need.
You do it by specifying any two out of three of:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    the goal date
  </li>
  <li>
    the goal value or cumulative total
  </li>
  <li>
    the rate &#8212; how much you&#8217;re changing your number or adding to your total per day or per week.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Beeminder infers the one you don&#8217;t specify.
Like if you want to weigh 150 pounds by Christmas, just say so and Beeminder will compute how many pounds per week that means you need to lose.
(Hello first world problems.)
Or if you figure you can lose half a pound a week and want to weigh 200 pounds, Beeminder will tell you when that will happen (if you stick to that rate).
Or maybe you want to lose a pound per week and want Beeminder to tell you what you&#8217;ll weigh on your birthday at that rate.
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"WEIGHT1\\"
    href=\\"#WEIGHT\\"
  >
    [1]
  </a>
</p>
<p>
  It&#8217;s math. You get the idea.
For many goal types the value you&#8217;re working towards might be something like &#8220;cumulative total number of pushups&#8221;, which may not be very interesting so you&#8217;d only ever worry about the goal date and the rate (number of pushups per day).
And commonly the goal is open-ended and you leave the date 10 years out and worry only about the rate.
Maybe you gradually dial it up as you get stronger, or flatten it for vacations.
</p>
<p>
  All of that is possible with the good old road dial, but not always convenient.
To schedule a vacation with the road dial you have to flatten your yellow brick road exactly a week before you leave, and then unflatten it exactly a week before you return.
</p>
<p>
  And what if you&#8217;ve been outperforming your yellow brick road and have accumulated too much safety buffer?
If all you have is the road dial then you need to dial up the steepness to something
  <em>
    more
  </em>
  than you can actually do, wait for the road to catch up to you, and then dial it back down again before it shoots past you and you derail.
</p>
<p>
  That was asking a lot, so a couple years later (out of private beta by that point) we added two fancy feature to address those scenarios.
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/breaks/\\"
    title=\\"Original blog post announcing the feature. The title image kind of sums it up perfectly.\\"
  >
    Scheduled breaks
  </a>
  means you can actually specify a date range in the future and the rate you want during those dates.
If you&#8217;re going hiking you can schedule flat spots on your productivity goals and steep spots on your exercise goals.
  <a
    href=\\"https://beeminder.uservoice.com/forums/3011-general/suggestions/2289727-retroratchet-\\"
    title=\\"The etymology here is complicated but since you&#39;re bothering to read hovertext on links, let me try to explain. Originally I wanted to be able to retroactively make yellow brick roads harder if you were outperforming them. You should always be allowed to make things harder immediately but then you&#39;re locked in. To make them easier you have to wait a week (the akrasia horizon). So the feature was supposed to ratchet your road to make it harder via retroactive adjustment. But then we didn&#39;t implement it that way and just had the road jump up discontinuously. But the name Retroratchet had stuck. I&#39;m hoping the Road Editor subsumes ratcheting and scheduled breaks so our long national nightmare of onomastic imperfection can come to an end. (Are you seriously reading this? Can we give you a prize? Seriously, email support, we&#39;ll come up with something!)\\"
  >
    Retroratcheting
  </a>
  is an easier way to get rid of excess safety buffer.
It just makes the yellow brick road jump up (or down) closer to your datapoint so, as of today, you&#8217;re closer to derailing than you were.
Gotta keep those bees nipping at your heels.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;It&#8217;s not allowed to intersect with the subtly pink-shaded region on the graph&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  So those are handy features, but the amount of caveats and confusion (and, sadly, bugs) with them has been, well, unfortunate.
Just two examples: dialing your road after scheduling breaks only adjusts the road after the last break, and retroratcheting shifts the dates of any scheduled breaks
(hard to avoid without causing worse problems, for some goals).
It&#8217;s a mess.
And the only real solution is to put the full yellow brick road under the user&#8217;s control.
Except, of course, that you
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/flexbind/\\"
    title=\\"Flexible Self-Control -- our manifesto on the concept of the akrasia horizon\\"

    can&#8217;t make your goal easier between now and a week from now
  </a>
  .
</p>
<h2>
  Now Available in Plan Bee!
</h2>
<p>
  So enough chit-chat, here&#8217;s how the new feature works!
You get an interface like the following, which gives the starting date and initial value of the yellow brick road, along with three fields for every segment of the road.
Each of those rows is just like the road dial &#8212; it specifies the end date, end value, and rate
  <em>
    for just that segment of the road
  </em>
  .

  For example, [2016-06-05, ___, 3] means &#8220;go at a rate of 3 through the 5th&#8221;. 
The final road row is for the same segment that the road dial adjusts &#8212; the one that ends on the actual goal date.
You can remove and add rows wherever you like &#8212; that&#8217;s what the little minus and plus buttons do.
We call it rudimentary because it doesn&#8217;t give you any guidance when you&#8217;re fussing with it.
It doesn&#8217;t even fill in the missing inferrable field like the road dial does.
But it does enforce the akrasia horizon constraint.
Visually, that means that whatever you change the road to, it&#8217;s not allowed to intersect with the subtly pink-shaded region on the graph.
In other words, you&#8217;re not allowed to make the road any easier between now and a week from now.
Any other adjustments are allowed, including retroactive ones.
</p>
<p>
  There are so many different ways to use this.
Sometimes I have goals where I had no idea what a reasonable rate was and I end up with datapoints way above the road with ugly jumps from ratcheting.
It can be really interesting (and more aesthetically pleasing) to retroactively fit the road to the data to see what rate I should&#8217;ve targeted and to help decide what&#8217;s realistic for the future.
(When the road was actually meaningful along the way it may feel really wrong to retroactively adjust it.
We encourage that feeling! 
We&#8217;re also working on something to make that less bad.
Stay tuned!)
</p>
<p>
  Another example of using the road editor might be if you have a weight loss goal and you want to try to lose weight aggressively until your sister&#8217;s wedding in 3 weeks, but after that you know you want to slow down, but keep losing weight.
You could schedule a segment that goes [Wedding-Date, Target, ___], but then let your road continue after that.
That&#8217;s much better than setting the wedding date as your goal date, which sets you up to yo-yo as soon as Beeminder isn&#8217;t minding you.

  Better yet, don&#8217;t beemind your weight since it&#8217;s not quite under your direct control.
It&#8217;s more of an outcome than an action.
Instead, beemind things like servings of vegetables, calories, steps, workouts, distance run, weight lifted, or time spent outside.

  Beeminder is a tool for getting yourself to do the things you want to do&#8230;
when you&#8217;re thinking about what you want to do
  <em>
    next week
  </em>
  .
For example, next week I want to 
eat healthy, 
work out at least 3 times, and 
work at least 40 hours on Beeminder.
That&#8217;s in stark contrast to what I want to do
  <em>
    right now
  </em>
  .
Namely, 
eat another brownie, 
sit on the couch a bit longer, 
not work out just yet, and 
watch just one more hilarious talking kitten video before getting down to work.
</p>
<p>
  The discrepancy between what you want to do now vs later is called
  <em>
    akrasia
  </em>
  .
As we explained in

    title=\\"Also check out the definition in the sidebar\\"

  </a>
  , 
akrasia is fundamentally a problem of overweighting immediate consequences.
The immediate yumminess of this pie outweighs its far off damage to my goal of losing 20 pounds in 6 months.
The immediate comfiness of this couch outweighs the far off damage of just one less workout.
It makes sense to care more about the present than the distant future but humans take this to irrational extremes, making trade-offs we are fully aware are patently ridiculous.
Such as dying years earlier for the pleasure of smoking.

<p>
  The purpose of Beeminder&#8217;s Yellow Brick Road is to fix that problem by adding immediate negative consequences to redress the immediate positive consequences
(the yumminess of the pie, the comfiness of the couch,

  , etc).
Stay on this road to your eventual goal; if you deviate from it even for a day, you lose.

  Here&#8217;s how it actually works.
</p>
<h3>
  All you
  <em>
    need
  </em>
  to know
</h3>
<p>
  All you
  <em>
    really
  </em>
  need to know is: stay on this yellow brick road every day!
But here&#8217;s just enough detail to know what that entails.
</p>
<p>
  For non-weight-loss goals, where we assume there&#8217;s no randomness in what you&#8217;re measuring
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"NOI1\\"
    href=\\"#NOI\\"

    [3]
  </a>
  , the yellow brick road is very simple:
Draw the dotted line from today to your goal &#8212; that&#8217;s the centerline of the road &#8212; and put a yellow-brick lane on either side that&#8217;s as wide as the targeted daily rate of change.
All that really means is that if you&#8217;re in the right lane today and do nothing (stay flat) then you&#8217;ll be in the wrong lane tomorrow.
The day after that you&#8217;ll be off the road.
So the lanes simply serve to tell you how many days of safety buffer you have.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  The road will not let you lose tomorrow if you&#8217;re in the right lane today.
</h4>
<p>
  With weight loss we have to account for random fluctuation.
As with all Beeminder goals, we guarantee that you can&#8217;t lose tomorrow if you&#8217;re in the right lane today.
But what if your weight is randomly up five pounds overnight? No problem, the road automatically widens to ensure you&#8217;re still on it.
Once it widens though, it stays fixed.
If you find yourself in the wrong lane then the top edge of the road is a fixed bright line that you&#8217;re not allowed to cross.
Another random up-fluctuation will doom you so you need to scramble back below the centerline so that the auto-widening guarantee kicks in again.
To play it totally safe, just make sure you stay below the centerline at all times.
And remember that the &#8220;can&#8217;t lose tomorrow&#8221; guarantee only works if you report every day.
</p>
<h3>
  All you ever
  <em>
    wanted
  </em>
  to know
</h3>
<p>
  People who have actually lost weight by following a yellow brick road have not needed any more explanation than above in order to enter into a commitment contract to stay on their road &#8212; even people with hundreds of dollars at risk.
So you can certainly stop reading now.
But if you&#8217;re interested in the motivation behind why the yellow brick road works the way it does, read on.
</p>
<p>
  If you&#8217;re still reading it&#8217;s likely because you&#8217;re wondering why it has to be so complicated, with the &#8220;magical&#8221; widening.
Why not just draw a single fixed, bright line that&#8217;s safely above your starting point and gradually slopes down to your goal?
Cross that line and you lose.
That seems to give all the benefits of inexorable progress and daily accountability.
</p>
<p>
  What&#8217;s missing, though, is that it doesn&#8217;t fully take into account the psychology of akrasia.
We&#8217;ve learned this the hard way.
</p>
<p>
  If your commitment contract is to stay below a fixed bright line then the right strategy is to always stay a safe distance from it, where &#8220;a safe distance&#8221; is something like &#8220;the most a random up-fluctuation could possibly be&#8221;.
Of course you don&#8217;t know what that is yet, which is the first and simplest advantage of the automatic widening: 
You&#8217;re letting Beeminder worry about how to define &#8220;a safe distance&#8221; based on your actual data.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  Maybe you behave for a few days, but that nice conservative line of safety has lost its bite.
</h4>
<p>
  But suppose you&#8217;ve got the fixed bright line version and you&#8217;ve worked out an absolute bare minimum safe distance such that on any given day there&#8217;s an extremely small chance of a random fluctuation pushing you above it.
That way the overall chances of ever crossing the line are acceptably low.
  <a

  </a>
  .
Today you&#8217;re right on that threshold of what you decided was a safe distance from the bright you-lose line.
So you
  <em>
    ought
  </em>
  to be super careful today.
But your short-term self, staring at today&#8217;s honey-glazed cheesecake special, knows that the chances of crossing the bright line are, by definition, extremely small.
If you eat this cheesecake, the chances are still quite small.
It&#8217;s an acceptable risk if it&#8217;s just this once.
(It really would be an acceptably small risk if it really were just this once, which you tell yourself it will be.)
So you eat the dessert.
And sure enough, you&#8217;re only a little into that safety margin the next day.
Maybe you behave for a few days, but that nice conservative line of safety has lost its bite.
You gradually creep further and further past it until you&#8217;re really dangerously close to the bright line.
This is motivating and you keep trying to get further below the bright line but unless you&#8217;re quite close to it, the fear can&#8217;t compete with the cake (and brownies, ice cream, etc).
So you stay too close to the edge day after day and it&#8217;s only a matter of time before an unexpectedly large random fluctuation pushes you over.
Cue the 8-bit rendition of Chopin&#8217;s Funeral March.

  Why would you be so silly?  Akrasia!  Same reason you came to us in the first place.
</p>
<p>
  Note that this isn&#8217;t speculation.
The yellow brick road used to be like that (worse actually; it would get wider but never narrower). We know.
</p>
<p>
  What&#8217;s the solution?  More immediacy!
We want to take all that gradually building risk and concentrate it on single days.
How?
Roughly we want to provide a warning line that would be dangerously close to the bright you-lose line except we make it totally safe as long as you&#8217;re below it.
(We move the bright you-lose line as necessary.)
If/when you cross that warning line we throw all the risk at you all at once.
Except, ironically, that&#8217;s so scary that it&#8217;s not so risky.
You have no choice but to panic now; you&#8217;re right up against the bright line.
The cheesecake can&#8217;t compete with that and you scramble back below the warning line to safety.
</p>
<p>
  Notice the difference.  In the simple fixed bright line version you would panic just as much if you were ever so close to the bright line.
But you can&#8217;t ever get that close without taking on a pretty big risk of overshooting and crossing it.
So you never get close enough to really panic or, more likely, you do and in doing so your risk of actually losing is way too big.
(Remember that panic is our friend. It gets us off our fat butts.)
Compare again to the magically moving bright line where you can and do get close enough to panic yet don&#8217;t take on the risk of overshooting and crossing it.
You&#8217;re automatically safe until panic mode is triggered, and then you really have to panic.
So you do, and you get safe again.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  When you&#8217;re in the wrong lane, the road width does not change.
</h4>
<p>
  To map this back to how the yellow brick road actually works:
what I&#8217;ve been calling the warning line here is really just the centerline of your road, the dotted straight-line path to your goal.
It, naturally enough, separates the right lane from the wrong lane.
And the bright you-lose line of course is the top edge of the road.
The bright line magically moves because the road width changes to honor the guarantee that you can&#8217;t lose tomorrow if you&#8217;re in the right lane today.

  When you&#8217;re in the wrong lane, the road width does not change &#8212; you&#8217;re in the case of the fixed bright line.
</p>
<h3>
  How does Beeminder decide how wide the yellow brick road should be?
</h3>
<p>
  Having laid out how and why the road magically widens to maintain the guarantee that you can&#8217;t fall off your road tomorrow if you&#8217;re in the right lane today, what determines the road width when you&#8217;re sitting pretty below the centerline?
Beeminder computes the road width to reflect the variance in your actual data.
Roughly, the width is such that if you retrofitted the road so that it followed your actual data as closely as possible, it would cover 90% of your datapoints (assuming no magical widening).
That means that if you try to follow along the bottom edge of the road then it should happen infrequently (1 in 20 times) that a random deviation bumps you above the centerline into the wrong lane.
If you thrive on panic, aim to be just barely below the centerline and you&#8217;ll be in the wrong lane and in serious danger of going off the road every other day, on average.
</p>
<p>
  Another corollary of Beeminder&#8217;s road width algorithm: if you find yourself just slightly into the wrong lane then you have about a 5% chance of a random up-fluctuation pushing you off the road, if you don&#8217;t buckle down.
The risk is correspondingly higher &#8212; and 5% should already be cause for alarm &#8212; the further into the wrong lane you are.
But as long as you take the danger of being in the wrong lane seriously, you&#8217;ll actually keep the risk very low.
</p>
<h3>
  The bottom line on the top edge
</h3>
<p>
  For non-weight-loss goals (no random fluctuations in what you&#8217;re measuring) the lanes of the road just serve to give you a couple days warning before you lose.
For weight loss it&#8217;s similar but the mechanism is trickier.
But in terms of committing to the contract all you really need to know is that Beeminder has free rein to make the road any width it wants, 
except that it can&#8217;t let you lose tomorrow if you&#8217;re in the right lane today.
If you&#8217;re in the wrong lane, just get back in the right lane as fast as humanly possible.
No more magical widening when you&#8217;re in the wrong lane &#8212; the top edge of the road is now in fact the bright, fixed, you-lose line.
Which you are suddenly
  <em>

  But this is not *necessarily* irrational. Some people, even when they step back and think about it, view this as a reasonable trade-off.
That&#8217;s absolutely their choice to make.

    For the present discussion we needn&#8217;t worry about the question of what &#8220;you lose&#8221; means.
But typically it&#8217;s that you entered into a monetary commitment contract and losing means losing a painful amount of money.
More generally, the idea is to approximate how bad it would be to fail at your long-term goal and then to arrange for a significant portion of that badness to hit you all at once if you deviate from the path to your goal on any given day.
As opposed to what happens naturally: a negligible portion of that badness hits you on any given day that you&#8217;re off track.
So no single day matters and so you stay off track day after day indefinitely!
  </p>
  <p>
    Of course another key advantage of the yellow brick road &#8212; the flipside of its harsh mistress-ness &#8212; is that you can build up a safety buffer.
You can get a comfortable distance below your road and then eat that pie guilt-free, because you&#8217;ve earned it and, as the yellow brick road shows, it will not throw you off track.

    On the back end this is actually all super general and there&#8217;s a boolean parameter, &#8220;noisy&#8221;, that determines whether the graph is measuring something with random fluctuations (aka noise).
But since weight is the only popular example of a noisy graph, we keep things simple by not exposing generality like that in the interface.

    For the math here we can start with the useful fact that if something has a 1 in N chance of happening each time you try it and you try it N times, then there&#8217;s a 63% chance that it will happen on at least one of those N trials.
If you&#8217;re going to do something risky over and over again and you want your overall risk to be, say, 1 in 100, then the risk each individual time better be much less &#8212; specifically 1 in 10,000 in this example if you&#8217;ll be repeating the risky thing 100 times.

    The point is that some things, like a crying baby or a literal fire, are both urgent and important and naturally preempt anything else.
If something&#8217;s the opposite &#8212; filling out TPS reports, or doomscrolling &#8212; ruthlessly cull that.
The tricky quadrants in the matrix are the urgent-but-not-important (phone calls, say) vs the important-but-not-urgent (like exercise and deep work).
You want to use tools like 
Beeminder (hi!)
and

      title=\\"It's like Beeminder but for one-off tasks\\"

    to help the important compete with the urgent &#8212; by creating urgency for important tasks.
  </p>

<p>
  The rocks are the opposite: things like spending time with family, playing music, learning new skills.
If you&#8217;re self-employed then billable hours might belong in this category.
</p>
<p>
  What makes the analogy memorable is to watch what happens when you let the pebbles vs the rocks take precedence. 
If the pebbles go in first then the whole jar ends up full of pebbles, with no room for any rocks.
</p>
<p>
  But if you put the rocks in first, plenty of pebbles (the truly urgent ones) will still fit in around them.
</p>
<p>
  The moral: Get those rocks in that jar!

  Traditionally this metaphor is taken further:
rocks, pebbles, sand &#8212; even water.
A jar full of rocks can still fit more pebbles.
A jar full of rocks and pebbles can still fit sand.
And&#8230; you get the idea.
I&#8217;m not sure what the sand and water correspond to in terms of getting things done though. 
Eating and breathing?

      and has used the Beeminder API to include beeminding one&#8217;s praying as part of the app.
It&#8217;s the holy grail, so to speak, of making one&#8217;s app sticky!
In this post Pedro Paulo describes how it works, first for users of the app, and then for iOS developers who may want to similarly integrate Beeminder.
There&#8217;s also an insightful philosophical/behavioral-economic detour about intrinsic, extrinsic, and transcendent motivation.

  App development is a very rewarding activity. 
I’m not talking about the monetary aspect, although it maybe rewarding on that front too, but the impact you can have in other people&#8217;s lives. 
With more than 5 million people using our apps I feel we have the responsibility to constantly improve their experience.

Praying the rosary while commuting, I&#8217;d constantly lose track of the Hail Marys.

In 2011, instead of praying a special devotion, I wrote code that would help me pray better in the future. 
Noticing that the experience had been positive I donated the code to the company I work for so they could build it into a product and make it available to other people.
Now more than 10k users pray the rosary daily using Electronic Rosary for iOS.
</p>
<p>
  One feature users asked for constantly was a mechanism to help them to pray this devotion every day. 
In iOS, we can set daily notifications but the downside of notifications is guessing correctly what time to display the notification. 
That’s where Beeminder comes in.

Leah Libresco asks and answers a question. 
It&#8217;s a very interesting consideration but I&#8217;d like to dissent somewhat.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Prayer is supposed to come from the heart, so is there something weird about graphing it and setting up my own penalties if I don’t measure up?
My answer is, yes, it’s a bit weird, but so is most of my prayer life. 
I’m a convert (&#8230;)
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  My answer is no, it&#8217;s not weird. 
It&#8217;s the way, with variations, a fair share of people successfully lead a life of prayer.
  <a
    href=\\"http://www.usccb.org/bible/romans/7\\"
    title=\\"'For I know that good does not dwell in me, that is, in my flesh. The willing is ready at hand, but doing the good is not. For I do not do the good I want, but I do the evil I do not want.'\\"

    Romans 7:18-19
  </a>
  illuminates why it&#8217;s not weird: 
&#8220;For I do not do the good I want, but I do the evil I do not want.&#8221;
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;As Leah Libresco describes, it can happen the other way around, using
  <strong>
    extrinsic
  </strong>
  motivation (Beeminder) as a tool to reach a
  <strong>
    transcendent
  </strong>
  goal.&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  A model of motivation I first

expands the
  <em>
    extrinsic
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
    intrinsic
  </em>
  model to accept a third category:
  <em>
    transcendent
  </em>
  . 
The
  <em>
    transcendent
  </em>
  in this case would be the
  <strong>
    &#8220;prayer is supposed to come from the heart&#8221;
  </strong>
  , 
the
  <em>
    intrinsic
  </em>
  <strong>
    &#8220;I need to pray more, as I understand it is important for my spiritual life,&#8221;
  </strong>
  and Beeminder (or other tools Catholics have used for centuries,

the
  <em>
    extrinsic
  </em>
  . 
Therefore, in this layered framework, each level supports the adjacent in order to achieve an ultimate goal.
</p>
<p>
  Inserting a poetic touch, I cannot resist the temptation to quote
  <a
    href=\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Guillaumet\\"
    title=\\"He walked for a week over three mountain passes. Though tempted to give up, he persisted while thinking of his wife, Noëlle, until June 19 at dawn when he was rescued by a 14-year-old boy named Juan García. He reached a village whose inhabitants could not believe his story. This exploit made him stand out among the 'stars' of Aéropostale.\\"
  >
    Henri Guillaumet
  </a>
  which Antoine de Saint-Exupery describes in the book &#8220;Wind, Sand and Stars&#8221;:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Tu résistais aux tentations.
« Dans la neige, me disais-tu, on perd tout instinct de conservation. 
Après deux, trois, quatre jours de marche, on ne souhaite plus que le sommeil. 
Je le souhaitais. Mais je me disais: 
&#8216;Ma femme, si elle croit que je vis, crois que je marche. Les camarades croient que je marche. Ils ont tous confiance en moi. Et je suis un salaud si je ne marche pas&#8217;. »
    <br>
     
    <br>
    <strong>
      You resisted temptation. 
&#8220;Amid snow,&#8221; you told me, &#8220;a man loses his instinct of self-preservation. After two or three or four days of tramping, all you think about is sleep. 
I would long for it; but then I would say to myself, 
&#8216;If my wife still believes I am alive, she must believe that I am on my feet. The boys all think I am on my feet. They have faith in me. And I am a skunk if I don&#8217;t go on&#8217;.&#8221;
    </strong>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Guillaumet used his
  <em>
    transcendent
  </em>
  drive 
(&#8220;the concern about the future of his wife&#8221;) 
to enable his
  <em>
    intrinsic
  </em>
  motivation 
(&#8220;find an elevated place to die, so his body could be located and insurance claim easier&#8221;) 
to empower the
  <em>
    extrinsic
  </em>
  (&#8220;take one step after another so he could rest&#8221;), 
in order to overcome the urge to sleep in the snow. 
However, on numerous occasions, as Leah Libresco described, it happens the other way around, using
  <em>
    extrinsic
  </em>
  motivation (Beeminder) as a tool to reach a
  <em>
    transcendent
  </em>
  goal.

  How Beeminder Works in Electronic Rosary
</h2>
<p>
  If you plan to use Electronic Rosary to beemind your praying habits, here&#8217;s what you do.
</p>
<p>
  In the sliding menu, select the Beeminder icon.
</p>
<p>
  <img
    class=\\"aligncenter\\"
    alt=\\"Sliding menu to open Beeminder\\"
    title=\\"Sliding menu to open Beeminder\\"
    width=\\"50%\\"
    src=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/beeminderBlog01.png\\"
  >
</p>
<p>
  If you have not authorized the app to access your Beeminder account yet, you&#8217;ll be redirected to Beeminder&#8217;s website to get the appropriate permission.
After granting access you&#8217;ll be redirected to Electronic Rosary.
</p>
<p>
  The next step is to select among
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/faq#qset\\"
    title=\\"Beeminder FAQ item about how to set up a goal\\"
  >
    your goals
  </a>
  which one the app will update at the end of the rosary.
</p>
<p>
  <img

    width=\\"50%\\"
    src=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/rosary-screenshot2.png\\"
  >
</p>
<p>
  Now we are ready to go. 
For every rosary you finish, the app will send a +1 to
your Beeminder goal and you&#8217;ll see a popup confirmation.
</p>

  Now I’d like to share how easy is to integrate Beeminder with any iOS app.
</p>
<h2>
  iOS SDK and Beeminder: A Brief How-To
</h2>
<p>
  The
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/api\\"
    title=\\"Beeminder REST API. It's very easy to use!\\"
  >
    Beeminder API documentation
  </a>
  covers the first step of registering your app.
</p>
<h3>
  Authentication
</h3>
<p>
  To get the user’s goals and to add a datapoint to a particular goal you must first authenticate using OAuth2.
In the iOS SDK it&#8217;s easy to do that without any external library:
</p>
<pre>
  <code>
    static NSString * BackendBaseURL = @\\"https://www.beeminder.com/\\";
static NSString * OAuth2Path     = @\\"apps/authorize\\";
static NSString * ClientId       = @\\"client_id=mysupersecretwithbeeminder\\";
static NSString * RedirectURI    = @\\"redirect_uri=iterco://beeminder-callback\\";
static NSString * ResponseType   = @\\"response_type=token\\";

- (void) beginOAuth
{
  if([[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults]
      stringForKey:@\\"beeminder_token\\"] == nil)
  {
    NSString * auth = [BackendBaseURL stringByAppendingFormat: @\\"%@?%@&amp;%@&amp;%@\\",
                                                               OAuth2Path,
                                                               ClientId,
                                                               RedirectURI,
                                                               ResponseType];
    [[UIApplication sharedApplication] openURL:[NSURL URLWithString:auth]];
  }
}
  </code>
</pre>
<p>
  It will redirect you to Safari where the user will authorize Beeminder to let your app have access to your account. 
No login credentials are entered in your app.
</p>
<p>
  The
  <code>
    redirect_uri
  </code>
  you should set at
  <code>
    CFBundleURLSchemes
  </code>
  in the
  <strong>
    Info.plist
  </strong>
  of your project.
</p>
<p>
  Safari will redirect you back to your app and you’ll listen for it in your App Delegate and store the
  <code>
    access_token
  </code>
  to access Beeminder on behalf of the user:
</p>
<pre>
  <code>
    -(BOOL) application:(UIApplication *)application handleOpenURL:(NSURL *)url
{
  NSLog(@\\"%@\\",url);
  if([url.host isEqualToString:@\\"beeminder-callback\\"]) {
    NSArray * comp = [url.query componentsSeparatedByString:@\\"&amp;\\"];
    for(NSString * st in comp) {
      NSArray * twoComp = [st componentsSeparatedByString:@\\"=\\"];
      if(twoComp.count == 2) {
        if([twoComp[0] isEqualToString:@\\"access_token\\"]) {
          [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] setObject:twoComp[1] 
                                                 forKey:@\\"beeminder_token\\"];
          [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] synchronize];
        } else 
        if([twoComp[1] isEqualToString:@\\"username\\"]) {
          [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] setObject:twoComp[1] 
                                                 forKey:@\\"beeminder_username\\"];
          [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] synchronize]; 
        }
      }
    }       
  }
  return YES;
}
  </code>
</pre>
<h3>
  Requesting the Goals
</h3>
<p>
  Since Beeminder&#8217;s API is pure JSON I suggest a library like
  <a
    href=\\"https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking\\"
    title=\\"AFNetworking is a delightful networking library for iOS and Mac OSX\\"
  >
    AFNetworking
  </a>
  to make things easier.
</p>
<pre>
  <code>
    - (void) refreshGoalsWithCompletion: (void (^)(BOOL, NSInteger))completion
{
  id success = ^(AFHTTPRequestOperation * operation, id JSON) {
    NSMutableArray *l_goals = [NSMutableArray arrayWithCapacity:[JSON count]];
    for(NSDictionary * goal in JSON) { [l_goals addObject:goal]; }
    _goals = [l_goals copy];
    completion(YES, 200);
  };
  id failure = ^(AFHTTPRequestOperation *operation, NSError *error) {
    completion(NO, [operation.response statusCode]);
  };
  NSDictionary *params = @{ @\\"access_token\\" : [self getToken] };
  [_client getPath:@\\"/api/v1/users/me/goals.json\\"
           parameters:params success:success failure:failure];
}
  </code>
</pre>
<p>
  In the above function
  <code>
    _client
  </code>
  is a variable of our helper class initialized as:
</p>
<pre>
  <code>
    _client = [AFHTTPClient clientWithBaseURL:
    [NSURL URLWithString:@\\"https://www.beeminder.com/\\"]];
[_client registerHTTPOperationClass:[AFJSONRequestOperation class]];
[AFNetworkActivityIndicatorManager sharedManager].enabled = YES;
  </code>
</pre>
<h3>
  Adding Datapoints
</h3>
<p>
  The last step after the user selects which goal will be updated when he prayed the rosary is to add a datapoint.
</p>
<pre>
  <code>
    - (void) addOneUnitToGoal:(void (^)(BOOL, NSInteger))completion
{
  id success = ^(AFHTTPRequestOperation * operation, id JSON) {
    completion(YES, 200);
  };
  id failure = ^(AFHTTPRequestOperation *operation, NSError *error) {
    completion(NO, [operation.response statusCode]);
  };
  NSDictionary *params = @{
    @\\"access_token\\": [self getToken],
    @\\"comment\\": @\\"Added by Electronic Rosary by Netfilter\\",
    @\\"value\\": @\\"1\\"
  };

  NSString * path = [NSString stringWithFormat:
                     @\\"/api/v1/users/me/goals/%@/datapoints.json\\",
                     [self getSelectedGoal]];
  [_client postPath:path parameters:params success:success failure:failure];
}
  </code>
</pre>
<p>
  We’ll be releasing in the next few weeks the full code of the helper class to integrate Beeminder in your iOS app 
(we need to refactor the code decouple it from our libraries, although a
  <a

  The third James Bond movie, Goldfinger, opens with an amphibious mission to
  <a
    href=\\"http://youtube.com/watch?v=NVg23yjKl1g\\"
    title=\\"Opening sequence of Goldfinger\\"
  >
    destroy an illicit chemical processing facility
  </a>
  . After emerging from the water and planting the explosives, Bond strips off his drysuit to reveal a perfectly pressed white tuxedo and calmly affixes a red carnation to the lapel.
</p>
<p>
  It&#8217;s rare that the next step after &#8220;take off your wetsuit&#8221; is &#8220;attach carnation to lapel&#8221; &#8212; it&#8217;s not routine, even ignoring the exploding chemicals bit. The Bond franchise and other filmmakers succeed by mastering this device, by leading viewers along a path and then suddenly yanking them out of the context they thought they were in. In some cases it&#8217;s overused to the point of becoming a trope (and ironically, somewhat predictable).
</p>
<p>
  Another example is natural language processing &#8212; what Google uses to guess what you&#8217;re searching for, like it did just now when I typed &#8220;natural la&#8221;. In most sentences that start with &#8220;he left the keys on the kitchen&#8230;&#8221;, the next word is &#8220;table&#8221;, or maybe &#8220;counter&#8221;.
</p>
<p>
  The drysuit-to-tuxedo reveal is the word that you don&#8217;t see coming. It&#8217;s the equivalent of completing the sentence above with &#8220;ceiling&#8221; instead of &#8220;table&#8221;. When you read a sentence or watch James Bond, your brain automatically produces guesses and predictions for what&#8217;s going to happen next.
</p>
<p>
  When our guesses are wrong, we become engaged, or upset, or we laugh. We feel alive. That&#8217;s because bucking routine, and the expected, is uniquely human &#8212; for the moment, anyway. Artificial intelligence bots like Watson or competitors in the Turing test are usually confounded by the absurd or unexpected. It&#8217;s conceivable that they could eventually do quite well with it though, especially given how quickly humans

    href=\\"http://xkcd.com/16/\\"

  </a>
  .
</p>
<h3>
  Avoiding routine
</h3>
<p>
  Falling into a routine can diminish your potential, not to mention your sense of free will. Athletes know that if they maintain constant mileage, weight, or intensity for a long period of time, their muscles will eventually stagnate. Much better is constant growth, followed by recovery.
</p>
<p>
  How can you avoid falling into a routine? It&#8217;s helpful to have an outsider&#8217;s perspective. If you&#8217;re the one that&#8217;s stuck in the rut, it can be hard to notice and break out. The path of least resistance is usually the one that doesn&#8217;t bend much from the current trajectory.
</p>
<p>
  There are plenty of hacks to get around this. The oldest, low-tech approach is regularly talking to a good friend who is willing to act as a sounding board and give candid feedback. A more formal approach looks something like a life coach &#8212; regular checkins on stated goals and aspirations.
</p>
<p>
  In the life coach situation you&#8217;re paying, often dearly, for personal attention from a real human being in order to keep you on your toes. But what you get from a life coach (or any outsider, really) isn&#8217;t all that different from what you might tell yourself to do. If only you could have your present self communicate effectively with your future, soon-to-be-present self and guide him through evaluating some things in the cold light of yesterday.
</p>
<p>
  Even before we get AI bots that can understand subtle, even British, humor, software is eating the world
  <a

    top of Maslow&#8217;s pyramid
  </a>
  .
</p>
<p>
  That may seem like a ridiculous conclusion, and contrary to everything I just said &#8212; that you could write software to make people more spontaneous, more human, and more fulfilled. I suspect, though, that this falls into the category of problems where the right

  , which is focused more specifically on goals that you set up for yourself and capturing &#8220;moments&#8221; as you progress towards them. Sort of a self-directed life coach.

<p>
  This is a slightly nerd-oriented integration but copying and pasting URLs around is really the only skill you need to set this up.
And then once it&#8217;s set up, you don&#8217;t need to do anything at all ever (except for the thing you&#8217;re beeminding of course).
That being the point of an autodata integration.
</p>
<p>
  So the way this works is you give Beeminder an RSS feed &#8212; a URL that probably ends in &#8220;.rss&#8221; or &#8220;/feed&#8221; or maybe &#8220;.xml&#8221; &#8212; and Beeminder gives you a +1 every time a new item appears in that feed. 
RSS feeds are commonly used to track new blog posts on a blog but they can be anything.
Wikipedia can give you the
  <a
    href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS\\"
    title=\\"It stands for Really Simple Syndication\\"

  </a>
  .
Or just check out these examples of beemindable RSS feeds that we and our beta users came up with and you&#8217;ll get the idea:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <a
      href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/storygraph\\"
      title=\\"This sneakily links to our announcement of our StoryGraph integration because we think you should use that instead of GoodReads!\\"
    >
      GoodReads
    </a>
    gives you an RSS link on your profile page of all the books you read. (If you know of other websites that give you an RSS feed of your activity, let us know!)
  </li>
  <li>
    Make a journal thread in
    <a
      href=\\"http://forum.beeminder.com/c/life\\"
      title=\\"For kvetching, kvelling, and kibitzing. Share your stories! Get moral support! Offer advice!\\"
    >
      the Life category of the forum
    </a>
    and beemind posting to it &#8212; just append &#8220;.rss&#8221; to the end of the URL for your thread. 
(Note: It counts other people&#8217;s posts too, which may be fine &#8212; you&#8217;re posting interesting enough stuff to generate discussion!)
  </li>
  <li>
    Beemind your (and only your) contributions to the forum in general, with a URL like
    <code>
      forum.beeminder.com/u/USERNAME/activity.rss
    </code>
    (I&#8217;m
    <a

      doing this myself
    </a>
    ).
  </li>
  <li>
    Publish more YouTube videos. 
To get the RSS URL, right-click on your channel&#8217;s page, &#8220;view page source&#8221;, then control-f for &#8220;feeds&#8221; and grab the URL that looks like
    <code>
      youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCASoR5UzKZZFiJ6gzE-ChWw
    </code>
    .
  </li>
  <li>
    Obviously if you have your own blog you should beemind posting to it.
We sure as heck wouldn&#8217;t have managed to blog for 12 years and counting without doing that.
Pretty much all blogging software makes it easy to get an RSS feed of the posts.
For example, if you blog on Substack the RSS feed lives at a URL like
    <code>
      yootles.substack.com/feed
    </code>
    .

putting RunKeeper in third place.
However, as one of our early integrations, RunKeeper was pretty bare bones. 
You could beemind mileage (or kilometrage) running and you&#8217;d like it.

  But the RunKeeper app tracks all sorts of stuff &#8212; from running to nordic skiing, and rowing &#8212; so we thought it was high time we made the integration a little more useful.
</p>
<p>
  So check out our RunKeeper integration makeover!
</p>
<p>
  You can track the distance, duration, or frequency of your running, walking, cycling, any subset of those activities, or of the union of all your RunKeeper fitness activities.
You can also turn this on for an existing Beeminder goal in the settings &#8212; just first authorize us to pull your RunKeeper data in Your Account &gt;&gt;

  TagTime isn&#8217;t very user friendly, and it is not a front-page citizen as far as automatic data sources go. 
It&#8217;s actually a user-run script that pushes to Beeminder (instead of Beeminder pulling the data down from a third party). 
But it was the first data source we integrated with Beeminder in the beginning.

In any case, with the New Year around the corner, this classic post coining the term &#8220;Schelling fence&#8221; is especially relevant to Beeminder.

  Slippery slopes are themselves a slippery concept. 
Imagine trying to explain them to an alien:
</p>
<p>
  &#8220;Well, we right-thinking people are quite sure that the Holocaust happened, so banning Holocaust denial would shut up some crackpots and improve the discourse. 
But it&#8217;s one step on the road to things like banning unpopular political positions or religions, and we right-thinking people oppose that, so we won&#8217;t ban Holocaust denial.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
  And the alien might well respond: 
&#8220;But you could just ban Holocaust denial, but not ban unpopular political positions or religions. 
Then you right-thinking people get the thing you want, but not the thing you don&#8217;t want.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
  This post is about some of the replies you might give the alien.
</p>
<h3>
  Abandoning the Power of Choice
</h3>
<p>
  This is the boring one without any philosophical insight that gets mentioned only for completeness&#8217; sake. 
In this reply, giving up a certain point risks losing the ability to decide whether or not to give up other points.
</p>
<p>
  For example, if people gave up the right to privacy and allowed the government to monitor all phone calls, online communications, and public places, then if someone launched a military coup, it would be very difficult to resist them because there would be no way to secretly organize a rebellion. 
This is also brought up in arguments about gun control a lot.
</p>
<p>
  I&#8217;m not sure this is properly thought of as a slippery slope argument at all. 
It seems to be a more straightforward &#8220;Don&#8217;t give up useful tools for fighting tyranny&#8221; argument.

  <em>
    The Adventures of Murder-Gandhi
  </em>
  : 
Gandhi is offered a pill that will turn him into an unstoppable murderer. 
He refuses to take it, because in his current incarnation as a pacifist, he doesn&#8217;t want others to die, and he knows that would be a consequence of taking the pill. 
Even if we offered him $1 million to take the pill, his abhorrence of violence would lead him to refuse.
</p>
<p>
  But suppose we offered Gandhi $1 million to take a different pill: 
one which would decrease his reluctance to murder by 1%. 
This sounds like a pretty good deal. 
Even a person with 1% less reluctance to murder than Gandhi is still pretty pacifist and not likely to go killing anybody. 
And he could donate the money to his favorite charity and perhaps save some lives. 
Gandhi accepts the offer.
</p>
<p>
  Now we iterate the process: 
every time Gandhi takes the 1%-more-likely-to-murder-pill, we offer him another $1 million to take the same pill again.
</p>
<p>
  Maybe original Gandhi, upon sober contemplation, would decide to accept $5 million to become 5% less reluctant to murder. 
Maybe 95% of his original pacifism is the only level at which he can be
  <em>
    absolutely sure
  </em>
  that he will still pursue his pacifist ideals.
</p>
<p>
  Unfortunately, original Gandhi isn&#8217;t the one making the choice of whether or not to take the 6th pill. 
95%-Gandhi is. 
And 95% Gandhi doesn&#8217;t care
  <em>
    quite
  </em>
  as much about pacifism as original Gandhi did. 
He still doesn&#8217;t want to become a murderer, but it wouldn&#8217;t be a disaster if he were just 90% as reluctant as original Gandhi, that stuck-up goody-goody.
</p>
<p>
  What if there were a general principle that each Gandhi was comfortable with Gandhis 5% more murderous than himself, but no more? 
Original Gandhi would start taking the pills, hoping to get down to 95%, but 95%-Gandhi would start taking five more, hoping to get down to 90%, and so on until he&#8217;s rampaging through the streets of Delhi, killing everything in sight.
</p>
<p>
  Now we&#8217;re tempted to say Gandhi shouldn&#8217;t even take the first pill. 
But this also seems odd. 
Are we really saying Gandhi shouldn&#8217;t take what&#8217;s basically a free million dollars to turn himself into 99%-Gandhi, who might well be nearly indistinguishable in his actions from the original?
</p>
<p>
  Maybe Gandhi&#8217;s best option is to &#8220;fence off&#8221; an area of the slippery slope by establishing a
  <a
    href=\\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/14a/thomas_schellings_strategy_of_conflict/\\"
    title=\\"Short book review for Schelling&#39;s classic book *Strategy of Conflict*\\"
  >
    Schelling
  </a>
  point &#8212; an arbitrary point that takes on special value as a dividing line. 
If he can hold himself to the precommitment, he can maximize his winnings. 
For example, original Gandhi could swear a mighty oath to take only five pills &#8212; or if he didn&#8217;t trust even his own legendary virtue, he could give all his most valuable possessions to a friend and tell the friend to destroy them if he took more than five pills. 
This would commit his future self to stick to the 95% boundary (even though that future self is itching to try the same precommitment strategy to stick to its own 90% boundary).
</p>
<p>
  Real slippery slopes will resemble this example if, each time we change the rules, we also end up changing our opinion about how the rules should be changed. 
For example, I think the Catholic Church may be working off a theory of 
&#8220;If we give up this traditional practice, people will lose respect for tradition and want to give up even more traditional practices, and so on.&#8221;

<h3>
  Slippery Hyperbolic Discounting
</h3>
<p>
  One evening, I start playing
  <em>
    Sid Meier&#8217;s Civilization
  </em>
  (IV, if you&#8217;re wondering &#8212; V is terrible). 
I have work tomorrow, so I want to stop and go to sleep by midnight.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;If I consider the problem early in the evening, I can precommit to midnight as a nice round number that makes a good Schelling point&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  At midnight, I consider my alternatives. 
For the moment, I feel an urge to keep playing Civilization. 
But I know I&#8217;ll be miserable tomorrow if I haven&#8217;t gotten enough sleep. 
Being a

    title=\\"An ancient post on LessWrong that predates Beeminder\\"
  >
    hyperbolic discounter
  </a>
  , 
I value the next ten minutes a lot, but after that the curve becomes pretty flat and maybe I don&#8217;t value 12:20 much more than I value the next morning at work. 
Ten minutes&#8217; sleep here or there doesn&#8217;t make any difference. 
So I say: &#8220;I will play Civilization for ten minutes &#8212; &#8216;just one more turn&#8217; &#8212; and then I will go to bed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
  Time passes. 
It is now 12:10. 
Still being a hyperbolic discounter, I value the next ten minutes a lot, and subsequent times much less. 
And so I say: I will play until 12:20, ten minutes sleep here or there not making much difference, and then sleep.
</p>
<p>
  And so on until my empire bestrides the globe and the rising sun peeps through my windows.
</p>
<p>
  This is pretty much the same process described above with Murder-Gandhi except that here the role of the value-changing pill is played by time and my own tendency to discount hyperbolically.
</p>
<p>
  The solution is the same. 
If I consider the problem early in the evening, I can precommit to midnight as a nice round number that makes a good Schelling point. 
Then, when deciding whether or not to play after midnight, I can treat my decision not as &#8220;Midnight or 12:10&#8221; &#8212; because 12:10 will always win
  <em>
    that
  </em>
  particular race &#8212; but as &#8220;Midnight or abandoning the only credible Schelling point and probably playing all night&#8221;, which will be sufficient to scare me into turning off the computer.
</p>
<p>
  (if I consider the problem at 12:01, I may be able to precommit to 12:10 if I am especially good at precommitments, but it&#8217;s not a very natural Schelling point and it might be easier to say something like &#8220;as soon as I finish this turn&#8221; or &#8220;as soon as I discover this technology&#8221;)
</p>
<h3>
  Coalitions of Resistance
</h3>
<p>
  Suppose you are a Zoroastrian, along with 1% of the population. 
In fact, along with Zoroastrianism your country has fifty other small religions, each with 1% of the population. 
49% of your countrymen are atheist, and hate religion with a passion.
</p>
<p>
  You hear that the government is considering banning the Taoists, who comprise 1% of the population. 
You&#8217;ve never liked the Taoists, vile doubters of the light of Ahura Mazda that they are, so you go along with this. 
When you hear the government wants to ban the Sikhs and Jains, you take the same tack.
</p>
<p>
  But now you are in the unfortunate situation described by Martin Niemoller:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>
      First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out, because I was not a socialist.
      <br>
      &nbsp;
      <br>
      Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out, because I was not a trade unionist.
      <br>
      &nbsp;
      <br>
      Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out, because I was not a Jew.
      <br>
      &nbsp;
      <br>
      Then they came for me, but we had already abandoned the only defensible Schelling point.
    </em>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  With the banned Taoists, Sikhs, and Jains no longer invested in the outcome, the 49% atheist population has enough clout to ban Zoroastrianism and anyone else they want to ban. 
The better strategy would have been to have all fifty-one small religions form a coalition to defend one another&#8217;s right to exist. 
In this toy model, they could have done so in an ecumenial congress, or some other literal strategy meeting.
</p>
<p>
  But in the real world, there aren&#8217;t fifty-one well-delineated religions. 
There are billions of people, each with their own set of opinions to defend. 
It would be impractical for everyone to physically coordinate, so they have to rely on Schelling points.
</p>
<p>
  In the original example with the alien, I cheated by using the phrase &#8220;right-thinking people&#8221;. 
In reality, figuring out who qualifies to join the Right-Thinking People Club is half the battle, and everyone&#8217;s likely to have a different opinion on it. 
So far, the practical solution to the coordination problem, the &#8220;only defensible Schelling point&#8221;, has been to just have everyone agree to defend everyone else without worrying whether they&#8217;re right-thinking or not, and this is easier than trying to coordinate room for exceptions like Holocaust deniers. 
Give up on the Holocaust deniers, and no one else can be sure what other Schelling point you&#8217;ve committed to, if any&#8230;
</p>
<p>
  &#8230;unless they can. 
In parts of Europe, they&#8217;ve banned Holocaust denial for years and everyone&#8217;s been totally okay with it. 
There are also a host of other well-respected exceptions to free speech, like shouting &#8220;fire&#8221; in a crowded theater. 
Presumably, these exemptions are protected by tradition, so that they have become new Schelling points there, or are otherwise so obvious that everyone except Holocaust deniers is willing to allow a special Holocaust denial exception without worrying it will impact their own case.
</p>
<h3>
  Summary
</h3>
<p>
  Slippery slopes legitimately exist wherever a policy not only affects the world directly, but affects people&#8217;s willingness or ability to oppose future policies. 
Slippery slopes can sometimes be avoided by establishing a &#8220;Schelling fence&#8221; &#8212; a Schelling point that the various interest groups involved &#8212; or yourself across different values and times &#8212; make a credible precommitment to defend.

Beeminder is proud to once again support the Quantified Self conference.
This time we&#8217;re doing that by providing free admission for 5 students!
</p>
<p>
  Applying is super simple:
Send an email to

For years I&#8217;ve been achieving a reasonable middle ground by sticking to three categories:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Things to save for ever and ever
  </li>
  <li>
    Stuff to throw away right now
  </li>
  <li>
    Everything else
  </li>

Anything that isn&#8217;t obviously garbage or obviously needs to be kept forever, I toss into a big box. 
Now I&#8217;ve got a reverse-chronological stack of papers inside a box (instead of strewn all over my desk in varying useless attempts at order).
If I ever need to find that receipt for

Rationally, you should go to the gym but retain the flexibility to change your mind.
But then, for a rational person it wouldn&#8217;t be an issue in the first place.
So you could say Beeminder is about fighting irrationality with irrationality.

  Connoisseurs of productivity porn, which we&#8217;re afraid to say this blog may count as, probably know about the Seinfeld Hack, also known as Don&#8217;t Break The Chain.
The idea&#8217;s so simple (in a good way) that you don&#8217;t even need to follow
  <a
    href=\\"http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret\\"
    title=\\"LifeHacker post, “Jerry Seinfeld&#39;s Productivity Secret”. “Secret” in pretty huge scare quotes. UPDATE: And Jerry Seinfeld has disavowed this so boo LifeHacker for spreading lies!\\"

    the link to LifeHacker
  </a>
  where the idea originated.
It&#8217;s merely the psychological trick of getting yourself to do something every day by looking at the chain of X&#8217;s for the days in a row you&#8217;ve done it so far.
If you build up a nice streak then it would feel like a shame to break it.
So you don&#8217;t.
</p>
<p>
  We agree that Don&#8217;t Break The Chain can be remarkably powerful &#8212; but only once you have a long chain to not break. 
Until then there&#8217;s a catch-22: you can sometimes keep failing again and again indefinitely, never building up the motivating chain. 
And that problem repeats every time the chain breaks. 
So you&#8217;re always in a precarious situation where one bad day can precipitate many more bad days, where you go down a slippery slope of 
&#8220;one more day won&#8217;t hurt; I&#8217;ll get a new chain started tomorrow&#8221;.
</p>
<p>
  The Seinfeld hack&#8217;s greatest strength is also its fatal flaw.
Once you do break the chain, all the motivation it provided bursts like a bubble.
</p>

    alt=\\"Jerry and George\\"
    title=\\"That's also its fatal flaw!\\"

</p>
<p>
  There&#8217;s also the problem of inflexibility.
What if you need to do something consistently but not literally daily?
At least one

  </a>
  we know of mitigates this problem by letting you specify days of the week that don&#8217;t count and showing you your chain as unbroken as long as you do the thing on all the days that do count.
</p>
<p>
  Beeminder simultaneously turns the flexibility to 11 and magnifies the subtle psychological pull of the Seinfeld hack into raw unassailable motivation.
</p>
<p>
  With Beeminder you can commit to maintaining a certain average, like 3.5 workouts per week (or 3 blog posts per month &#8212; see the sidebar of this blog).
It doesn&#8217;t matter what days of the week, and, critically, you can build up a safety buffer and then take some time off, without the danger that that will lead you down a slippery slope of sloth. 
With Beeminder&#8217;s yellow brick road you&#8217;ve precommitted to not let your overall average dip too far.
(If you do, we literally charge your credit card.
  <a

  </a>
  )
</p>
<p>
  If the rate you want to maintain is exactly 7 per week &#8212; 6.9 is unacceptable &#8212; and if you can sustain that long term, then Don&#8217;t Break The Chain may be perfect. 
Everything else you should beemind!

  Did you just mouth &#8220;what??&#8221; and rush to this footnote to see if we&#8217;re serious?
Then welcome, Newbee, to the Beeminder blog.
We&#8217;re totally serious!
It&#8217;s initially $0 at risk but the second time you fail to keep all your datapoints on the yellow brick road to your goal, we charge you real money.
For some people, avoiding putting money at risk is itself powerful motivation.
That&#8217;s fine with us.
If Beeminder is as life-changing for you as it is for some of our users we figure you&#8217;ll find a way to pay us eventually.
Probably by beeminding more and more things more and more ambitiously, to the point where occasional derailments are no big deal and are worth it.
</p>
<p>
  [UPDATE 2018: We originally put it like this, before deciding to require a payment method from the start:
&#8220;We&#8217;re totally serious! Although you don&#8217;t have to put in a credit card until the first time you fail to keep all your datapoints on the yellow brick road to your goal. For some people, avoiding giving Beeminder their credit card is itself powerful motivation.&#8221;]

  </a>
  (but tend to offer solutions like &#8220;ffffgb,,,&#8221; to any given query).
I have two degrees in English Literature and will shortly have one in Biology, and I&#8217;m not satisfied yet, so Beeminder support is the perfect thing to fit around my ongoing education, frenzied reading sessions, and insatiable urge to learn everything that sits still long enough.
</p>
<p>
  Still, this is Beeminder, so maybe the most important thing is what I actually track on the site!
I have 35 goals at the moment.
Some are fairly traditional targets for beeminding: 
French and Welsh on Duolingo, 
a step goal linked to Fitbit, 
keeping my blogs up to date.
Some are a bit more out of the way. 
Here&#8217;s a rundown of some of the most important/interesting (at least to me!):

    </a>
    I decided I wouldn&#8217;t work on
    <em>
      reducing
    </em>
    that number.
That would turn a thing I love into a chore.
Instead I just make sure I actually read from that pile, and not just the new shinies. 
That approach is working better so far. 
These books have to be on a specific list I&#8217;ve compiled of all the books that qualify. 
Not on the list? It doesn&#8217;t count. 
Now I just need a goal to remind me to keep the list up to date&#8230;

    </a>
    : 
This goal is retired now, but it&#8217;s still worth mentioning because it&#8217;s a success story.
The first time I wrote a dissertation, I was really disorganised and overwhelmed. 
This goal for my second dissertation reminded me to stay current with the literature and keep looking for more things to include. 
And now my marks are in and I did really!

    specify more points for a book I&#8217;ve owned for years, or for a book I took four weeks to read. 
The points are tracked in a spreadsheet, and my Beeminder graph is simple: 
I just add the number of points I get per book (or sometimes per day, if I finish multiple books on the same day).

Sometimes, things go wrong. 
Sometimes, this is due to my own careless mistakes. 
This goal allows me one careless mistake per week (because everyone makes mistakes sometimes), and then it&#8217;ll start to punish me. 
I was doing this manually by donating the money, but that wasn&#8217;t as trackable, and I have drunk the Kool-Aid at this point: track everything trackable!

this one involves planning my day and my priorities.
Every night, I pick my two Most Important Tasks for the next day and enter them as the comment in my report for the current day. 
I&#8217;m&#8230; a little distressed by how often this slips, actually.

I have mine configured to send +1 whenever I consciously stop, notice myself picking at my skin, and push the button. 
At the moment I have a generous amount of room for error. 
It will get less generous! 
I&#8217;m not using this as much as I should be, to be quite honest, but that&#8217;s partly because I have healed up quite a bit and my picking behaviour is down to a level where I don&#8217;t always notice until long after the fact.

but in a nutshell, the goal is designed (after discussion with a doctor!) to help combat my anxiety disorder by reducing contributing behaviour. 
The more I check in about something that&#8217;s making me anxious, the more I need future reassurance. 
The goal is designed to break that cycle, while still giving me a bit of room to get stopgap help if it&#8217;s really unbearable. 
It really is helping! 
I&#8217;ve reduced the number of times per week I&#8217;m allowed to request reassurance without derailing, and my data has been pretty flat for a while. 
It&#8217;s not a miracle cure, but it
    <em>
      is
    </em>
    a bit of extra incentive to stop and let my brain do the talking instead of my panic. 
&#8220;Is this worth derailing, or can I manage?&#8221;

  in the support inbox (or the chat widget) and on the forums. 
It&#8217;s my job to answer emails, underail you if you have non-legit derailments, fix your yellow brick roads, and generally keep things running smoothly for you. 
It&#8217;s also my job to holler for someone to fix things when they go wrong, poke everyone to answer their email if I don&#8217;t know the answer, and generally keep the inbox in good shape. 
In the case of Beeminder and the inbox, if the question is &#8220;who minds the minders?&#8221;,
the answer is muggins here, that&#8217;s who. 
Which is actually pretty great, because Beeminder is pretty great and I have all the best coworkers

  I generally write &#8220;shanaqui&#8221; in lowercase because, although it&#8217;s become a name, it wasn&#8217;t meant to be.
It actually comes from Michael Scott&#8217;s
  <em>
    Tales of the Bard
  </em>
  trilogy.
People suggested the word in the book was from the Irish word &#8220;seanchaí&#8221;, which is pronounced almost the same (SHAN-a-kee). 
It means &#8220;storyteller&#8221;, so I adopted the word as my username both for being an appropriate description and for nostalgic love of the book in question.

If you can find someone with a problem that needs solving and you can solve it manually, go ahead and do that for as long as you can, and then gradually automate the bottlenecks. 
It would be a little frightening to be solving users&#8217; problems in a way that wasn&#8217;t yet automatic, but less frightening than the far more common case of having something automatic that doesn&#8217;t yet solve anyone&#8217;s problems.

  Generalizing that slightly, here&#8217;s what I call the Shirk &amp; Turk Principle:
When writing any new app or website or feature, implement as little of it as you can get away with and manually fake the rest behind the scenes.
Don&#8217;t write code in anticipation of its usefulness, write code when you have to.

<p>
  Why is that a good idea?
Because it&#8217;s amazing how often you implement the wrong thing or users fail to use it for whatever reason.

  &#8212; 
and don&#8217;t waste time building something until you know for certain you need to.
How do you know? Simply when you can&#8217;t keep up with doing it manually, because enough people are actually using the shell of a thing you built.
</p>
<p>
  Let me drive this point home with some stories.
</p>
<p>
  <a
    href=\\"http://beeminder.com\\"
    title=\\"I&#39;m not sure why you need a link to Beeminder if you&#39;re reading the Beeminder blog. Maybe it&#39;s good for SEO. Or maybe you came here from Hacker News or somewhere and don&#39;t actually know what Beeminder is yet. Boy are you in for a treat!\\"

    Beeminder

    title=\\"Story of Beeminder&#39;s name\\"
  >
    kibitzing bot
  </a>
  . 
The bot would email
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"EMAIL1\\"
    href=\\"#EMAIL\\"
  >
    [2]
  </a>
  you asking for your number (e.g., your weight) and would send you back a graph of your progress.
Guess who the bot was at first?
In that case I wasn&#8217;t exactly turking, since I wasn&#8217;t pretending there was any automation.
</p>
<p>
  <a
    href=\\"http://stripe.com\\"
    title=\\"I guess I don&#39;t need to tell anyone what Stripe is anymore, since it&#39;s a 10 billion company as of this writing. Just in case: they process credit card payments for us. They are unambiguously what you want to use if you want to accept credit card payments.\\"
  >
    Stripe
  </a>
  started life as &#8220;/dev/payments&#8221; with the idea that you should be able to treat payments like a Unix device file (so delightfully nerdy!) where there&#8217;s a bunch of real-world complexity that is elegantly abstracted away for you.
You should be able to send money around as easily as piping the contents of a file.
Beeminder is proud to be one of the first users of what is now Stripe and the founders later let us in on the secret that they were manually faxing documents around behind the scenes on our behalf to give us the experience of signing up and having money magically start appearing in our account when users paid us.
</p>
<p>
  Another Beeminder example:
When Beeminder is about to charge you money for going off track on your goal, we (automatically) send an email asking if there was any technicality or confusion or anything that would render the derailment not legit.
The user can reply to the email to say whether it was or not.
Our original intention was to automate that process in some way but we figured we&#8217;d start with shirking &amp; turking it.
We&#8217;d just manually read the replies and cancel charges as necessary.
</p>
<p>
  But funny thing about that example, the human interaction has proved critical in keeping people honest.
Sometimes new users presume the process is automated and reply with a bland &#8220;not legit&#8221;.
We reply with something like &#8220;oh no! what happened?&#8221; and they quickly realize they&#8217;re dealing with an actual human.
We&#8217;re pretty sure those actual humans will always be part of the service Beeminder provides.
</p>
<p>
  So that&#8217;s the extreme case of it being wisest not to write code too soon &#8212; we turned out to never want any code at all for that feature.
</p>
<p>
  This is a hard lesson for computer nerds like me to learn.
Even when you know there&#8217;s one single user &#8212; yourself &#8212; you may delude yourself into thinking it&#8217;s still worth writing code.

    alt=\\"xkcd: automation\\"
  >
</p>
<p>
  And sometimes it really is (or the coding is its own reward).
But that comic is funny because of how often it&#8217;s true.
And with users other than yourself it only gets worse.
</p>
<p>
  In conclusion, let me repeat all that in an overly rhymey haiku:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Specs and reqs are murk,

    Also writing code is work.

Only if feature X really is that fundamental should X be part of the MVP.)

Instead of building a product that&#8217;s web-first or mobile-first or tablet-first, think about whether you can get away with building one that&#8217;s email-first.

This also makes it especially easy to apply the Shirk &amp; Turk Principle!

  you haven&#8217;t had much choice about how much to pledge (put at risk) on your Beeminder commitment contracts.
It starts out
  <a href=\\"http://beeminder.com/money\\">
    free
  </a>
  , then $5, then each subsequent time you derail from your yellow brick road you&#8217;re encouraged (though not forced) to jump to the next pledge level for your next attempt:
</p>
<h2>
  <center>
    $5, $10, $30, $90, $270, $810, $2430

  >
    $810 the highest amount actually paid so far
  </a>
  ; UPDATE 2019: someone&#8217;s paid $2430 now).
Until now you could choose to stay at your current pledge after derailing but you could never go back down.
You could also never choose to jump ahead in the pledge schedule.
</p>
<p>
  Neither of those restrictions felt quite right.
We want to give you as much control as possible about how much money you have on the line, subject to three constraints:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    There&#8217;s a simple default path so you never have to think about the potentially agonizing question of what&#8217;s a motivating pledge amount.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can&#8217;t
    <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/akratics\\">
      akratically
    </a>
    lower your pledge amount, like lower it because you&#8217;re about to derail. 
In other words, you have to respect the

    .
  </li>
  <li>
    You can&#8217;t jump straight to amounts that really motivate you since Beeminder never gets paid that way.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  We see #1 as part of the reason Beeminder beats the pants off of our esteemed competitor,
  <a href=\\"http://stickk.com\\">
    StickK
  </a>
  : more
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/flexbind\\">

  and less pre-planning (not to mention the delicious, delicious data).

  .
But #3 is a shame to have as a constraint!
We want &#8220;making people awesome&#8221; to always come before &#8220;making Beeminder money&#8221;, though they&#8217;re largely
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/perverse\\">
    quite compatible
  </a>
  !
We&#8217;re now announcing what we hope is a way to have the best of both worlds.
</p>
<h2>
  Short-Circuiting
</h2>
<p>
  <strong>
    UPDATE 2014-05-18: Short-circuiting doesn&#8217;t work like this anymore! Scroll to the bottom!
  </strong>
</p>
<font size=\\"-1\\">
  <s>
    At any time you can click a button to bump your pledge up to the next level, which will pop up something like this:
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &#8220;Short circuiting the pledge schedule means you actually pay the current pledge! We hope you&#8217;ll view that as a fair fee for the service but of course if you haven&#8217;t been using Beeminder long enough then you&#8217;ll probably want to stay at the $5 pledge for now and not pay anything yet.&#8221;
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <a>
          Cancel

        <a>
          Charge me $5 and change my pledge to $10
        </a>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      It feels a little harsh but it&#8217;s better than no option to jump ahead, so it&#8217;s what we&#8217;re starting with!
    </p>
  </s>
</font>
<p>
</p>
<h2>
  Pledge Decaying
</h2>
<p>
  The other side of this coin is that you can also click a button to drop your pledge down to the previous level, which will immediately start a live
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/dial\\">
    one-week
  </a>
  timer, counting down to when the decrease takes effect.
At any time during that week you can hit cancel and stay at your current pledge.
If you let the timer run out then the amount you have on the line drops.
</p>
<font size=\\"-1\\">
  <s>
    The only way to go back up is (currently) to short-circuit, by paying the lower pledge.
    <p>
      We&#8217;re eager to see how much people use these features, and are very open to suggestions on how to tweak them.
Right now the cost to have $X immediately on the line for a goal is $X/2.
We could make that, say, $X/4 by making it so that you pay half the current pledge to short-circuit to the next level.
[UPDATE: And done.]
    </p>
  </s>
</font>
<p>
</p>
<h2>
  Update: How to get free short-circuiting
</h2>
<p>
  You now also have the option of getting free short-circuiting by paying for our

    title=\\"Blog post about our new premium plans: Bee Lite, Plan Bee, Beemium, and Beekeeper\\"

    Beemium plan
  </a>
  .
Again, pledge decaying is always free, just that it has a delay.
</p>
<h2>
  Another Update: Just one way to short-circuit
</h2>
<p>
  In the spirit of simplifying &#8212; and because we just sounded like huge jerks asking people to pay us purely in order to risk paying us
  <em>
    more
  </em>
  (fair as that was in principle, for those who actually read this post) &#8212; we now have just one way to short-circuit the pledge schedule:
  <a
    href=\\"http://beeminder.com/premium\\"
    title=\\"Need to be logged in to see this\\"
  >
    Go Beemium
  </a>
  .
Technically that&#8217;s still paying us in order to short-circuit but it&#8217;s one of many perks so hopefully it sounds like less of a slap in the face.
Keep letting us know what you think and thank you so much for all the feedback that led us to this conclusion in the first place!

    emergency blog post
  </a>
  is up to me.
I&#8217;m going to tell (part of) the story of how we keep getting ourselves into predicaments like running up and down steep things in the middle of the night.
</p>
<p>
  A year ago we were reading
  <a
    href=\\"https://medium.com/@andrewpbrett/737816851dc6\\"
    title=\\"This is pretty epic\\"
  >
    Andy Brett&#8217;s race report
  </a>
  &#8212; 62 miles and
  <em>
    not
  </em>
  a relay.
We like to think we&#8217;re hardcore but we&#8217;re pretty soft compared to
  <a
    href=\\"http://andybrett.com\\"
    title=\\"Andy Brett&#39;s homepage. No incessant rhyming in this hovertext. Move along.\\"
  >
    Andy
  </a>
  .
Anyway, Bee suggested that epic endurance events train mental discipline and that Andy&#8217;s hacktastic awesomeness is evidence of this theory.
(It&#8217;s also evidence for the &#8220;awesome people are awesome&#8221; theory, but the causality isn&#8217;t actually important here.)
</p>
<p>
  It led to a flurry of &#8220;we should&#8221; statements about epic endurance events, which is when I had a lightbulb moment that&#8217;s been serving me pretty well ever since.
I can present it as a trigger-action plan or life recipe, or simply as a habit to condition yourself with:
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    IF I say &#8220;I/we should do X&#8221; 
THEN I take some immediate action that gets me slightly closer to X happening.
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  Any tiny action is allowed, even &#8220;I&#8217;ll send an email now so we don&#8217;t forget.&#8221; 
I think of it as the anti-resolution resolution. 
As in, don&#8217;t just resolve to do things or make things happen, make them more likely, right now.
</p>
<p>
  Being lazy, this self-imposed rule often has a different effect, which is to make me catch myself about to say &#8220;I should X&#8221; and instead rephrase it as 
&#8220;It might be a good idea to do X but&#8230;&#8221; 
and then list the costs or downsides.
I feel like this is still a win, if only because it makes me feel less guilty about all the things I &#8220;should&#8221; be doing but aren&#8217;t.
</p>
<p>
  It almost goes without saying that a good default immediate action is creating a Beeminder goal.
</p>
<h2>
  Examples
</h2>
<p>
  But here are some specific examples that don&#8217;t just involve creating a Beeminder goal:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    &#8220;We should run a marathon sometime&#8221; &rarr; Find one later in the season and email a few friends about it.
  </li>
  <li>
    &#8220;Let&#8217;s be better about keeping the house clean&#8221; &rarr; Find a commitment device, like hosting a weekly meetup that will have a side effect of shaming you into tidying.
  </li>
  <li>
    &#8220;We should host a weekly meetup&#8221; &rarr; Send an email to a relevant mailing list proposing it.
  </li>
  <li>
    &#8220;I need to write more code&#8221; &rarr; Solve a Project Euler problem.
  </li>
  <li>
    &#8220;I should blog about X&#8221; &rarr; Email yourself some notes or work it into today&#8217;s daily beemail.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  I&#8217;m worried this sounds vacuous, like &#8220;just do things and be awesome&#8221;.
But the idea is to take
  <em>
    some
  </em>
  action, no matter how tiny, as a conditioned response to hearing yourself state an intention. 
Cultivate an aversion to saying &#8220;I should&#8230;&#8221;
and then sitting there like an idiot failing to follow through.
</p>

  For a long time I found that I was spending too much time on certain unproductive things and struggled with getting myself to do what I actually wanted to do with my time.
The big break came one morning when I noticed that there was a very tight correlation between the things I wanted to stop doing and the traditional Christian concept of Sin.
</p>
<p>
  Once I noticed this, I went straight to the Wikipedia page for the
  <a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_deadly_sins\\">
    Seven Deadly Sins
  </a>
  , and mapped them onto my own vices:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    Lust
  </strong>
  : Porn, flirting, etc.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    Gluttony
  </strong>
  : Junk food like cookies and chocolate. 
I might add &#8220;more than two bowls of spaghetti&#8221; here; the stuff is just too easy to eat.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    Sloth
  </strong>
  : Wasting time on stuff that isn&#8217;t goal directed or self-improving.
Being non-industrious. Failing to strive.
Useless news/discussion websites, etc.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    Wrath
  </strong>
  : Acting irrationally out of anger, pain, or frustration. 
Chewing someone out, violence, slamming doors, etc.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    Envy
  </strong>
  : Not reading, using, or appreciating someone else&#8217;s work because solving a problem is caught up in my identity.
</p>
<p>
  I&#8217;m too much of a cheapskate to have trouble with material excess (
  <strong>
    Greed
  </strong>
  ), and haven&#8217;t been burned by
  <strong>
    Pride
  </strong>
  yet, so I wouldn&#8217;t know what to avoid. 
Maybe I&#8217;ll figure these out soon.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;Concepts like Sin come with a rich aesthetic heritage that lends them some emotional weight.&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  The nice thing about traditional concepts like Sin is that they come bundled with some guarantees of relative completeness for very little cognitive investment on my part.
Someone has tested and developed this thing very extensively; even if it&#8217;s not perfect, all I have to do is use it. 
Further, concepts like Sin come with a rich aesthetic heritage that lends them some emotional weight and solidness that fresh concepts just don&#8217;t have. 
A culture that&#8217;s been going for &gt;1500 years will leave behind some impressive artifacts. 
We would be fools not to take advantage of them.
</p>
<p>
  While I figured all of this out, I had also been looking for a way to beemind my way out of these harmful behaviors. 
I&#8217;d considered a number of schemes, but none were satisfactory.
Armed with the concept of Sin, I had a comprehensive and reasonably clear-cut list of things to avoid.
When I read how
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/box/\\">
    Bethany beeminds sugar-free days
  </a>
  , I knew exactly what I had to do.
</p>
<p>
  How it works is this: if I do something that I judge to be sinful, I
  <em>
    don&#8217;t
  </em>
  get to report a Sin-Free Day to Beeminder, otherwise, I do. 
I need 5 Sin-Free Days per week.
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"MOR1\\"
    href=\\"#MOR\\"
  >
    [1]
  </a>
  Simple as that, and Sin is gone. 
It&#8217;s glorious.
</p>
<p>
  At work, we joke that the accountants are trying to kill us.
They leave donuts and chocolate and cookies out for everyone, and we eat them, whether we like it or not.
Well not anymore; it&#8217;s just not worth it to eat that cookie when it means that I immediately fail the whole day, so I don&#8217;t.
The only reason I didn&#8217;t eat like 20 tasty cookies today is because I beemind Sin.
</p>
<p>
  The traditional solution to akrasia and especially Sin is Willpower and self-loathing.
As an akratic, I don&#8217;t have Magical Free Will, but I don&#8217;t have to hate myself either,
because I have the next best thing: Beeminder!

  Ironically, this is a Do More goal, but what you&#8217;re doing more of is not-sinning.
So report a 1 to Beeminder for each day you were sin-free. Otherwise report a 0, or don&#8217;t report at all, which is the same thing.
Though it might be interesting to report explicit zeros so you can record the actual sinning in the datapoint comments (those are private by default).

  The last year has flown by like a swarm of bees. 
We do one of these blog posts every year and they&#8217;re kind of a mix between a family Christmas letter and a state of the union address. 
We&#8217;ll spend a while congratulating ourselves 
on the charming new babies we made this last year, we&#8217;ll show you some cute pictures of our dogs, and there&#8217;ll be a lot of humble-bragging and some lame puns.
Then we&#8217;ll throw up some statistics and end with some stirring patriotic language about the coming year.

<h2>
  Year In Review
</h2>
<p>
  Last October we had just
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/redesign/\\"
    title=\\"See also the &#39;beehind the scenes&#39; write-up by our web designer, Josh Pitzalis, a couple posts later\\"
  >
    unveiled a big redesign
  </a>
  and, having launched it too hastily, then spent months dealing with new bugs and problems.
Lesson learned!
But the redesign, if not the full aftermath, was part of last year&#8217;s review.
So, moving on, in the wee newness of 2017 we launched our
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/todoist/\\"
    title=\\"Our blog post announcing it. Todoist is arguably the best to-do list manager on the internet.\\"
  >
    Todoist integration
  </a>
  and later made big improvements to our
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/urlminder\\"
    title=\\"Landing page for starting a writing goal\\"
  >
    URLminder
  </a>
  integration and wrote a little guide for writers to

    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/write\\"
    title=\\"One of our Newbee Corner posts, but describes all the new hotness with URLminder\\"
  >
    automatically beemind their wordcounts
  </a>
  .
Then there was a nice leap forward for integrations in general: 
third-party integrations can now be
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/autofetch\\"
    title=\\"No more polling for autodata\\"
  >
    just as powerful
  </a>
  as official integrations.
In the spring we had some fun with
  <a

    title=\\"Maniac mornings in the month of May\\"
  >
    Maniac May-hem
  </a>
  . 
We
  <em>
    may
  </em>
  (ahem) make it a tradition.
Then more big integration news: 
iPhone users can now automatically beemind any of a slew of
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/apple/\\"
    title=\\"Blog post that also announces other improvements to our iOS app as well as improvements to our *other* iOS app, GTBee (about which more later in this post)\\"
  >
    health metrics from Apple Health
  </a>
  .
In travel news, we got to go to the
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/amsterdam/\\"
    title=\\"Blog post announcing the goings-on in Amsterdam\\"
  >
    Quantified Self global conference
  </a>
  in Amsterdam this summer, where we met some wonderful Beeminder users as well.
In less exotic travel news (from our perspective in Portland), we also hosted a wonderful Beeminder meetup in Seattle 
(it involved

  )
and met even more wonderful Beeminder fans.
The most recent big news items include 
the influx of new users from

</p>
<p>
  A big theme in general for us this year &#8212; just like last year, hence the redesign &#8212; has been making things easier for newbees.
Which is no mean feat given our complete unwillingness to sacrifice an iota of our data-centric power-user nerdacity.
(To be clear, it&#8217;s absolutely possible to have the best of both worlds, it just takes lots of tricky design work.)
The need to be more accessible was driven home for us by the Pact shutdown.
They sent an influx of curious newbees our way, people who were even primed with the idea of &#8220;pay if you screw up&#8221;, but who had a shockingly hard time getting their heads wrapped around Beeminder&#8217;s graphy way of thinking about things.
It prompted us to write a set of recipes for
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/pact\\"
    title=\\"Landing page for Pact users\\"
  >
    beeminding Pact-like goals
  </a>
  .
After that we (mostly Chelsea, who many Beeminder users know as our Support Czar but who has been doing more and more for Beeminder lately, including writing code)
embarked on some real Beeminder documentation (more than 100 articles so far!) which we&#8217;re collecting at
  <a
    href=\\"http://help.beeminder.com\\"
    title=\\"Thanks to Help Scout for providing the interface for this\\"
  >
    help.beeminder.com
  </a>
  .
</p>
<p>
  It&#8217;s a really excellent resource if you&#8217;ve got a question.
Chelsea and the rest of us are of course still there to spring into answering action if you send your questions to support too, but the help site captures a lot of the expert knowledge that we&#8217;re using to answer your questions in the first place.
A little bit like a searchable and incredibly detailed FAQ.
</p>
<p>
  Other goings-on in Beeminderland include 
a whole batch of bug fixes and improvements to restarting and archiving and deleting goals.
And some small improvements to

    GTBee
  </a>
  , which, if you didn&#8217;t know, is a dirt simple to-do list that charges you money for not getting your things done.
Kind of the other extreme from Beeminder in terms of tracking but with the same incentive scheme, namely, taking your money.
GTBee and the Beeminder iOS app are both by

  Finally, a big thing we want to mention even though it&#8217;s not exactly done and has plenty of rough edges, especially in terms of the interface:

  If you really want to know the gory details of what we&#8217;ve been up to, we made 365 User-Visible Improvements to Beeminder in the last 365 days and documented every one of them on our

Don&#8217;t forget we&#8217;ll owe one of you $1000 if we ever fail to maintain our average of one UVI per day!

<h2>
  State Of The Union Address
</h2>
<p>
  This is the part where we tell you how Beeminder is doing, how much money we are making, any major screwups we made this year, staffing changes, blah blah blah. 
We&#8217;re afraid to jinx ourselves right off the bat by saying that we failed to generate any great

  stories this year.
The saddest news for Beeminder (though exciting in every other way) is that our

Lillian, who had what she called a side hustle, has turned that into an sustainable company of her own, namely,

    title=\\"Personal finance with a dash of glitter (that&#39;s her tagline)\\"
  >

  .
She hasn&#8217;t left us entirely but most of the grand plans (like the

  </a>
  ) 
are not going to be happening in 2017.
(That also means we&#8217;re looking for help with things like marketing and advertising and socialmediaing. Also an Android developer!)
</p>
<p>
  Let us wrap this up with the bottom line, so to speak:
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/revenue-last-year.png\\">
    <img
      class=\\"aligncenter\\"
      width=\\"100%\\"
      alt=\\"Revenue graph: the past year\\"
      title=\\"Revenue graph: the past year\\"
      src=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/revenue-last-year.png\\"
    >
  </a>
</p>
<p>
  That&#8217;s how much money Beeminder&#8217;s been making this year &#8212; technically up from a year ago but really, on average, almost exactly flat.
It&#8217;s comfortable and pretty sustainable but it&#8217;s imperative that we grow over the next year.
We&#8217;re thinking about a commitment device to that effect, which we&#8217;ve employed successfully in the past.
It&#8217;s just that revenue is not a
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/whattomind\\"
    title=\\"Short version: beemind actions over outcomes\\"
  >
    good metric to beemind
  </a>
  and our last such commitment device was super stressful.
</p>
<p>
  Instead, we&#8217;ll end with our goals for the coming year which we think are most likely to make revenue grow, and on which we&#8217;ll be beeminding progress:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Yellow Brick Half-Plane (it doesn&#8217;t sound like a revenue generator, we know, but
    <em>
      everything
    </em>
    depends on this)
  </li>
  <li>
    More integrations, starting with a template for oauth-less 3rd-party integrations
  </li>
  <li>
    Improvements to onboarding, probably starting with a crazy-sounding
    <a
      href=\\"http://doc.bmndr.com/bsignups\\"
      title=\\"And it&#39;s still possible we&#39;ll conclude that requiring a credit card to sign up is revenue-maximizing and user-awesomeness-maximizing -- but don&#39;t worry, we won&#39;t conclude that without hard evidence\\"
    >
      signup hurdle
    </a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Infrastructure upgrades (just because there&#8217;s no choice about this)
  </li>
  <li>
    Lifecycle emails (starting with better unsubscribe controls, which are currently a mess)
  </li>
  <li>
    A referral program, currently half done (and we&#8217;re accepting guinea pigs!)
  </li>
</ol>

There is a funny back story with this one. 
Last winter our charmingly optimistic CEO, imagining we could have this integration done &#8220;like in a month&#8221;, got slightly telephone-gamed into committing to launch it in January.
When we noticed what we&#8217;d gotten ourselves into we

    offered
  </a>
  a compromise:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    I hereby promise that we&#8217;ll launch official Skritter integration before anything else except ones we&#8217;ve already started on

    &#8212; 
all of which we hope we can do in January, but now that it&#8217;s January 10 we&#8217;re noticing that&#8217;s not realistic).
AND I hereby promise that Bethany (our CTO) will spend 20 hours/week on the pending integrations (including Skritter) until they&#8217;re all launched. 
Here&#8217;s her Beeminder graph to prove it:

    .
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  For the record, it was perfectly clear to me all along that January was out of the question.
Though I suppose, given the 326 hours since January 10 that it took to finish launching these five integrations, I theoretically could&#8217;ve pulled it off in January with a

  Alright, still here? Excellent.

  Skritter is impressive. 
It is an app for helping you learn Chinese and Japanese.
It does spaced repetition of vocabulary, as well as implementing a nice interface for practicing the strokes to write the characters.
We first learned about Skritter when co-founder

    Nick Winter

  , 
who was an early Beeminder user, built a proto-integration between Beeminder and Skritter so that Skritter users could beemind their time studying.
So, technically, Skritter was the second autodata integration after Withings!
Meanwhile, we were really impressed by Nick, especially as he was working on his book

  If you don&#8217;t know anything about Beeminder, we&#8217;re a Quantified Self tool for collecting and visualizing data, and hard-committing to your goals.
We plot your progress along a Yellow Brick Road to your goal, send you reminders to keep studying, and if you go off track, we charge you money.
Long-time Beeminder users find that those stings (get it?) are well worth it for all the awesomeness we induce the rest of the time.
But if the thought of having to pay money is too scary, that&#8217;s perfect: you&#8217;ll be very motivated to keep all your datapoints on your yellow brick road.
</p>
<p>
  We think that the awesomeness of Skritter combined with the sting of Beeminder is going to be a killer combination for success for you Skritterers.
Skritter is a great tool for practicing, as long as you keep using it regularly.
Now Beeminder&#8217;s got you covered.
</p>
<h2>
  Getting Started
</h2>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;It is an app for helping you learn Chinese and Japanese&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  Using the integration is pretty simple.
On the landing page you authorize us to read your Skritter data, pick which language you are studying, and tell us how much time you want to commit to.
We&#8217;ll set up a graph for you and send reminders if you get too close to the edge.
We check for new data before we send a reminder, and at the end of the day, but if you want to update Right Now you can visit your graph page and click the &#8220;refresh&#8221; arrow above the graph, and that will force a sync.
</p>
<p>
  One thing that&#8217;s a bit different about the Skritter integration from our other autodata sources is that we set the goal&#8217;s deadline to be 4am.
That&#8217;s to match Skritter&#8217;s end of day, which is set to be 04:00, because it is the
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.ted.com/talks/rives_on_4_a_m?language=en\\"
    title=\\"Apparently TED is the new Poetry\\"
  >
    least likely time to be awake
  </a>
  .
Usually for autodata integrations we fix the deadline to be midnight and don&#8217;t allow you to change it, but because Skritter is counting work done between 00:00 and 04:00 as still counting toward the previous day&#8217;s totals, we need to match that up.
Otherwise we&#8217;ll potentially miss data done in the twilight hours.
</p>
<p>
  The rest of it is pretty hands off.
As long as you keep studying you won&#8217;t get charged, but if you fall below the road we call that derailing.
We&#8217;ll charge you and readjust your road so that you&#8217;re back on track.
We give you a week off after a derail, so it&#8217;s a great time to reassess and adjust how much studying you have to do every day.
As a matter of fact, you can adjust your goal any time, it just takes a week to take effect.
So you can plan ahead to give yourself a break or adjust how challenging your goal is, but, in the words of

you can&#8217;t change it out of laziness unless you are particularly forward thinking about your laziness (in which case you probably won&#8217;t sign up for this).

<h3>
  Beeminder Reprise
</h3>
<p>
  You&#8217;re probably here because you either know and love Beeminder, or you know and love Sleep as Android. 
Since this is Beeminder turf we&#8217;ll start with a quick explanation of what Beeminder&#8217;s all about. 
(For the full Beeminder story, you could start with
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/akrasia\\"
    title=\\"&#39;How To Do What You Want: Akrasia and Self-Binding&#39;\\"
  >
    our inaugural blog post
  </a>
  about akrasia and self-binding, a.k.a. commitment devices.)
</p>
<p>
  What&#8217;s special about Beeminder is that we combine Quantified Self &#8212; where Sleep as Android excels &#8212; with commitment contracts.
If you don&#8217;t know anything about commitment devices, it works like this with Beeminder:
We plot your progress along a Yellow Brick Road to your goal and if you go off track, we charge you money.
Long-time Beeminder users find that those stings (get it?) are well worth it for all the awesomeness we induce the rest of the time.
But if the thought of having to pay money is too scary, that&#8217;s perfect: you&#8217;ll be very motivated to keep all your datapoints on your yellow brick road.
We don&#8217;t even ask for a credit card until the first time you go off track.
</p>
<h3>
  Sleep as Android
</h3>
<p>
  If you&#8217;re a Quantified Self nerd, which, reading this blog you probably are, there are so many things to love about Sleep as Android!
It tracks your sleep cycles, wakes you up at the optimal point in your sleep cycle, tracks sleep debt and bedtime, even plays you lullabies.
It also tracks snoring statistics and records your talking in your sleep.
One of our favorite features (philosophically, if not in terms of our personal need for it) is built-in commitment devices for waking up on time.
You can use captchas, math problems, NFC tags, QR codes, and shaking your phone as ways to ensure you&#8217;re actually awake before dismissing the alarm. 
This is pretty brilliant and I personally would love to get an NFC tag to get me out of bed as soon as the alarm rings in the morning. 
This is basically the same idea as putting your alarm out of arm&#8217;s reach across the room, except that you can put the snooze button arbitrarily far away from your bed. 
I could even attach the NFC tag to a tree several blocks away so I had to get up and go outside to turn my alarm off in the morning!
</p>
<p>
  Best of all, Sleep as Android integrates with more and more services via their SleepCloud platform.
In addition to Beeminder, there&#8217;s the

  Beeminding Sleep
</h3>
<p>
  For our initial launch there&#8217;s only one aspect of your sleep you can mind: total amount of sleep.
You authorize Beeminder (via Google) to read your Sleep as Android data and then tell us how many hours per night you want to commit to.
That&#8217;s really all you need to know to get started.
Next we plan to add the ability to commit to getting to bed or waking up by certain times, or limiting the amount of time spent awake after your chosen bedtime.

UPDATE: we forgot to mention that the Cloud Backup add-on is necessary for integration with Beeminder. You can buy it in-app, and it backs up your sleep data. (Otherwise it&#8217;s all stored locally and we can&#8217;t read it directly off your device).

  <a
    href=\\"http://beeminder.com/changelog#548\\"
    title=\\"Entry from Beeminder&#39;s changelog\\"
  >
    noticed and fixed
  </a>
  some months (ok, the better part of a year &#8212; blush!) after we publicly launched in late 2011:
</p>
<p>
  Say our user Alice has two goals.
One is her book reading goal which she wants to share with her book club, beeminder.com/alice/reading.
She also has a super embarrassing private goal, beeminder.com/alice/lessporn.
</p>
<p>
  Now say that her co-worker, Noah, learns about her book goal and wants to see what else Alice is beeminding.
Nosy Noah can start poking around and trying Beeminder URLs.
If we give a 404 Not Found when he navigates to beeminder.com/alice/kick-more-puppies, that&#8217;s all well and fine.
But then if we give a not-allowed response when Noah guesses beeminder.com/lessporn, we&#8217;ve just given away that goal&#8217;s existence.
So even though that naughty Noah can&#8217;t view the goal, he knows it is there.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;You can&#8217;t collect information on what Beeminder goals someone has just by trying URLs and seeing if they&#8217;re not-allowed vs not-found&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  Our solution is to give a not-allowed error for any random beeminder.com/alice/stuff URL that Noah tries (unless it&#8217;s a real and public goal, of course).
That way Noah can&#8217;t collect information on what Beeminder goals Alice has just by trying URLs and seeing if they&#8217;re not-allowed or not-found.
</p>
<p>
  As was all obvious from the start for anyone with an ounce of
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.google.com/search?q=slytherin\\"
    title=\\"Slytherins tend to be ambitious, shrewd, cunning, ... you get the idea\\"
  >
    Slytherin
  </a>
  in them.
Hence, Slytherin 404s.
Which is what we propose calling this little security best-practice from now on.
</p>
<h3>
  404 Not Found vs 401 Not Authorized vs 403 Forbidden
</h3>
<p>
  In one sense it doesn&#8217;t matter whether you say &#8220;not found&#8221; to everything or &#8220;not allowed&#8221; to everything.
The point is not to tip off the bad guys by doing something different depending on whether the URL exists.
</p>
<p>
  Interestingly the
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.4.4\\"
    title=\\"Another way to think of 401 vs 403 is that the latter is a more severe version: authorization won&#39;t help, you can&#39;t see this no matter what.\\"
  >
    HTTP spec itself
  </a>
  ,
when talking about what to do when someone tries to access forbidden resources, says:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    If the server does not wish to make this information available to the client, the status code 404 (Not Found) can be used instead.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;Humans may sometimes need to lie to fully conceal sensitive information but computers should never need to&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  This is pretty quibbly but we disagree with the spec on that.
It should be a &#8220;Not Authorized&#8221; (or &#8220;Forbidden&#8221;) that&#8217;s used for both not-authorized and not-found if you want to conceal the existence of hidden stuff.
You&#8217;re not authorized to even know if it exists!
Giving a 404 is technically a lie.
Humans may sometimes need to lie to fully conceal sensitive information but computers should never need to.

<p>
  (We decided to go with &#8220;403.5 Not Found!&#8221; to avoid the case where a Nazi goes to beeminder.com/alice/jewhiding, jumps to the conclusion that such a goal exists, and

  before following the link and reading this blog post.)
</p>
<p>
  UPDATE:
I want to add that this isn&#8217;t pure philosophy. 
Even pragmatically, I actually hate the lying. 
If you&#8217;ve mistyped your own username or are accidentally logged in to your roommate&#8217;s account or something it&#8217;s super confusing and frustrating to be given a 404 and start trying variations of the URL. 
Or even the brief moment of panic when you think something got obliterated. 
I strongly disagree with, for example, GitHub&#8217;s approach to Slytherin 404s for this reason.
</p>
<p>
  <br>
  &nbsp;
  <br>
</p>
<p>
  PS: The other Slytherin solution to this in the case of Beeminder goals is for Alice to let all her goals be public but just give the embarrassing ones plausibly deniable codenames, like /lesspork. 
(Sorry to have just ruined that one! Even more sorry to anyone who may have had a for-real less-pork goal!)

  Humans of the internet! 
This post isn&#8217;t really for you, but if you&#8217;re curious what we&#8217;re talking about, lifecycle emails are what companies are doing when they automatically send you a series of emails like
&#8220;thanks for signing up for our thing!&#8221;, and 
&#8220;you don&#8217;t seem to have actually used our thing yet; can we help with that?&#8221;, or
&#8220;now that you&#8217;ve done X, you should maybe do Y!&#8221;, and so on.
There&#8217;s a particular way those can be, well, smarmy, and we want to convince our fellow startups not to do that thing.

  Fellow startups!
I think you should follow all of Patrick McKenzie&#8217;s brilliant recommendations for

except for this one:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    &#8220;Hi $NAME, I saw that you signed up for mycompany.com a few days ago.&#8221;
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Why not?
Because it has the intent to deceive the recipient &#8212; should they happen to be sufficiently naive &#8212; that there&#8217;s a human taking a personal interest in them.
</p>
<p>
  Our compromise has been to add 
&#8220;PS: this is obviously automated but you can reply and we&#8217;ll see it&#8221;. 
(You do want to emphasize that the user can reply like normal even though it&#8217;s an automated email.)
Or just saying &#8220;we&#8221; instead of &#8220;I&#8221; can go a long way towards de-smarming. 
Then it&#8217;s like &#8220;we, our whole company, including the programs that send these emails&#8221;. 
It is a subtle difference, but feels much more genuine to me, and is less likely to trigger my disgust reaction. 
An email from Patrick about how
  <em>
    he
  </em>
  noticed something about
  <em>
    you
  </em>
  is, well, false.
</p>
<p>
  I can imagine a counterargument along the lines of the email retroactively becoming true for the subset of customers who actually reply to it. 
But that only ensures you won&#8217;t get
  <em>
    caught
  </em>
  making a false statement.

  So despite there being some evidence

  the humans of the internet actually caring about this kind of thing, I think there&#8217;s a deeper issue at stake.

which I assumed was an automated email, and even went so far as to hold up more than once as an example of staying (barely) on the good side of the smarmbot line since it never makes a claim like &#8220;I (personally) noticed&#8230;&#8221;:

  <a href=\\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2012/08/on-the-goodness-of-beeminder.html\\">
    amazing article about how much Beeminder improves her life
  </a>
  .
She made several important points, one of which is particularly reblogworthy, especially if we take the liberty of rephrasing it like this: 
Beeminder is
  <a href=\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria\\">
    S.M.A.R.T.
  </a>
</p>
<h3>
  <p>

    pecific
    <br>
    <font color=\\"red\\">
      M
    </font>
    easurable
  </p>
</h3>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You get &#8220;specific&#8221; and &#8220;measurable&#8221; by virtue of defining your yellow brick road, that is, by creating a goal in Beeminder.
</p>
<h3>
  <p>
    <font color=\\"red\\">
      A
    </font>
    ttainable
    <br>
    <font color=\\"red\\">
      R
    </font>
    elevant
  </p>
</h3>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Attainable&#8221; means you
  <em>
    can
  </em>
  do it and &#8220;Relevant&#8221; means you
  <em>
    want
  </em>
  to do it.
Beeminder is for goals you know you
  <em>
    want
  </em>
  to achieve, you know you
  <em>
    can
  </em>
  achieve, but that historically you
  <em>
    don&#8217;t
  </em>
  achieve.
In other words, goals that pass what we call
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/wantcanwill/\\">
    the Want-Can-Will Test
  </a>
  .
</p>
<h3>
  <p>
    <font color=\\"red\\">
      T
    </font>
    ime-bound
  </p>
</h3>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea here is to create a sense of urgency. 
Beeminder manages this even for ongoing, open-ended goals, normally not considered SMART-compatible. 
You have to be on your yellow brick road at the end of every day.
</p>
<p>
  (In recent literature, SMART has been extended to SMARTER. Beeminder&#8217;s got that covered&#8230;)

<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/dial\\">
    road dial
  </a>
  makes this possible.
As Katja Grace puts it, &#8220;you can fine-tune the challengingness of a goal, but can’t change it out of laziness unless you are particularly forward thinking about your laziness.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
  <br>
  &nbsp;
  <br>
</p>
<p>
  Katja Grace makes several other excellent points:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    There&#8217;s a lot of value in making visible daily progress toward goals
  </li>
  <li>
    There&#8217;s some powerful psychology in the don&#8217;t-break-the-chain lifehack (and Beeminder makes it more flexible and thus even more powerful)
  </li>
  <li>
    Beeminder lets you hard-commit to things that it usually requires a more extreme position (e.g., identifying as a vegetarian) to commit to; in other words, Beeminder is safety rope for slippery slopes
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  She also makes a pretty profound point that Beeminder can&#8217;t take any credit for, but it&#8217;s a good insight for choosing the metrics you beemind.

  It&#8217;s much better than previous studies and statistics I&#8217;ve seen on the efficacy of commitment devices. 
Not because others have been down on commitment devices.
On the contrary, I&#8217;ve been frustrated in the past by
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/competitors\\"
    title=\\"Not to suggest they&#39;ve intentionally been misleading, but they&#39;ve been unintentionally so. Potentially. The point is that without a randomized controlled trial you can&#39;t conclude the things they&#39;ve implied. But now, to some extent, you can! Just maybe less so. At least for the case of smoking cessation. Ok, so it&#39;s all still a bit fuzzy if you want to generalize the conclusions.\\"
  >
    Beeminder competitors
  </a>
  who tout statistics about how 80% or whatever of people who risk money succeed. 
For starters they usually don&#8217;t even distinguish from the hypothesis of &#8220;people will
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/cheating\\"
    title=\\"Beeminder blog post: Combatting Cheating\\"
  >
    lie
  </a>
  to keep from losing their money!&#8221;
In other words, &#8220;80% succeed&#8221; may mean &#8220;80% either succeed or cheat and pretend to&#8221;.
This study is robust to that, with saliva and urine tests to verify smoking cessation.
But beyond that, other studies I know of haven&#8217;t accounted for the selection effect of only super serious people being willing to risk money. 
At the extreme, maybe anyone hard core enough to risk money is hard core enough to succeed regardless.
</p>
<p>
  How does this study account for that?
First, they use an intent-to-treat methodology.
That means that they look at the results for everyone randomized into the commitment device treatment, even the ones who refused to participate.
</p>
<p>
  And here&#8217;s the first interesting result: 
Only 14% of people assigned to the carrot-and-stick treatment &#8212; risking $150 to win $650 &#8212; were willing to play.
But those 14% did so well (52% of them succeeded in quitting) that the whole intent-to-treat group still did significantly better than the control group of smokers trying to quit with no financial incentives.
</p>
<p>
  Then there was the pure reward group. 
$800 with no strings attached for managing to quit smoking. 
90% of people in this intent-to-treat group were happy to participate. 
Apparently 10% of people hate money.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    (Aside: Maybe it&#8217;s just 5% that hate free money.
Because the pure reward group was actually two groups: 
One was really no-strings-attached $800 for quitting smoking and 95% of those offered that accepted it.

      src=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/grumpy-cat.jpg\\"
    >
    The other was a &#8220;collaborative reward&#8221; treatment where you were grouped with 5 other people and your rewards depended on the performance of the group.
There was even a chatroom to encourage each other.
85% of people in that intent-to-treat group participated &#8212; it must&#8217;ve seemed like too much hassle to the other 15%.
Or they didn&#8217;t hate money but they did hate people.
In any case, since the individual vs group-oriented treatments had no significant effect on smoking cessation rates, the two variations were combined in most of the analysis.
Hence the 90% overall acceptance rate for the pure reward group.
And as an aside to this aside, collaborative penalties, like

      title=\\"Beeminder blog post dissing GymPact\\"
    >
      GymPact
    </a>
    where the losers pay the winners, didn&#8217;t help either, compared to the individual version.)
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Using straight up intent-to-treat analysis, pure rewards do best.
Here are the key numbers for smoking cessation rates:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    6% quit in the control group with standard treatment, no money
  </li>
  <li>
    16% quit in the pure $800 reward group
  </li>
  <li>
    10% quit in the commitment contract group risking $150 + $650 reward
  </li>
  <li>
    (52% quit in the subset of the commitment contract group (14% of them) who actually participated)
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  In other words, pure rewards yield the most smoking cessation, mostly because so many more people are willing to be incentivized that way.
Speculating further &#8212; &#8220;if only we could get more people to accept the carrot-and-stick approach&#8221; &#8212; sounds super suspicious because we don&#8217;t know if the relatively huge success of the precommitters was simply because only people who were going to succeed anyway were willing to risk their own money.
</p>
<p>
  But the authors did some fancy statistics and concluded the carrot-and-stick treatment really is better.
In fact, they estimate that the people choosing the commitment contracts would have to be 12.5 times more likely to quit smoking on their own before you&#8217;d have to reverse the conclusion that carrot-and-stick results in more success than pure carrot.
</p>
<p>
  I&#8217;m highly biased to believe that (and remember to 
&#8220;

  >
    beware the man of one study
  </a>
  &#8221;)
but even if all the tricky statistics are wrong, we still have the result that, for cases where you don&#8217;t have a third party to fund rewards for you, you can always find a third party to collect your penalties.

  But reading mainstream media coverage (or blog coverage) of scientific papers is more often a telephone game.
Papers have nice abstracts (or TL;DRs as the internet calls them) and introductions and discussion sections that are usually at least as readable as news articles, with the added bonus of not horribly misleading you about the conclusions of the research.

  As you likely know if you&#8217;ve ever beeminded your weight, you can add a moving average line on top of your data on your Beeminder graph.
You can also add a so-called aura around your datapoints.
The idea is to see trends in your data without being distracted by daily fluctuations, particularly when data is coming from inherently unpredictable (aka noisy) sources like your weight.
</p>
<p>
  Until recently both the moving average and the aura have been somewhat
  <a
    href=\\"https://github.com/beeminder/road/issues/152\\"
    title=\\"Issue in our bug database: Polynomial fit is often pretty dumb\\"
  >
    wrong and ugly
  </a>
  .
In particular, the moving average line (MAV) used an exponentially weighted average of past datapoints, aka
  <a
    href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_smoothing\\"
    title=\\"See also The Hacker&#39;s Diet\\"
  >
    Exponential smoothing
  </a>
  .
Doing that has nice properties and is very simple to implement but it means the smoothed line lags behind the actual data, as if the line got shifted to the right (hover over the image if that seems backwards).
If you turned on the moving average for a monotonic graph like a do-more &#8212; not that it makes sense to do that for a do-more goal &#8212; then you&#8217;d see the moving average line was very visibly offset from the actual datapoints.
Like this:
</p>
<p>
  <img
    class=\\"aligncenter\\"
    alt=\\"Graph image\\"
    title=\\"Perhaps confusingly, the smoothed purple line is to the right of the datapoints when it's lagging behind the datapoints. Think of the datapoints going up and to the right and hitting some value v at time t. The smoothed line is doing that with some delay and so it takes until time t plus delta to hit value v. Hence the smoothed line is  to the right of the datapoints (literally always to the right if the datapoints are monotonic, as in this example). Anyway, it can be confusing at first blush that lagging means a shift to the right but if you stare at it long enough it becomes intuitive.\\"

We&#8217;ve mostly convinced ourselves that all the nice properties of exponential smoothing touted in
  <em>
    The Hacker&#8217;s Diet
  </em>
  still apply to our non-laggy smoothing.
Namely, making your weight go down still pulls the moving average down.
But feel free to debate this with us if you&#8217;re attached to the Hacker&#8217;s Diet scheme.)
</p>
<p>
  Moving on from the moving average to the aura, the idea is to visualize a coarse envelope around the entirety of your data.
The aura shows how variable your data is &#8212; indicated by the thickness of the aura &#8212; as well as what direction it&#8217;s heading.
The second reason to show the aura is to provide a crude projection of how your data would progress a week into the future.
Until recently the aura used a polynomial (of third degree or lower) that best fit the visible portion of the data. 
However, since Beeminder goals usually have a wide range of data trends 
(variations based on different seasons, motivational levels, life circumstances, etc.) 
such a low-degree polynomial approximation often failed (sometimes miserably) to achieve either of these desiderata.
In the following example it&#8217;s doing fine at showing the data&#8217;s variation, not so fine at projecting the trend forward:

  >
</p>
<p>
  For all those reasons, we recently revamped both the MAV and the aura.
Here&#8217;s how they work!
</p>
<p>
  The algorithms are based on filtering methods in signal processing. 
In particular, there are two types of commonly used digital filters,
  <a
    href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_impulse_response\\"
    title=\\"Have a Wikipedia rabbit hole!\\"
  >
    Finite-Impulse-Response (FIR)
  </a>
  and
  <a
    href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_impulse_response\\"
    title=\\"Or this *infinite* Wikipedia rabbit hole!\\"
  >
    Infinite-Impulse-Response (IIR)
  </a>
  filters. 
FIR filters are akin to moving average filters with a finite window, commonly used, for example, in image filters such as blurring. 
IIR filters are closer to the exponential filter mentioned above, belonging to a more general class of recursive filters.
For IIR, incoming data is passed through a discrete dynamical system taking past and present values of both the data and the filter states to compute the next filtered datapoint. 
Both of these alternatives have pros and cons with respect to computational efficiency and accuracy, but it turned out that the faster IIR filters are better for Beeminder&#8217;s use cases.
</p>
<p>
  In signal processing, such filters are characterized by their
  <em>
    frequency response
  </em>
  , which is how much of various frequency components of the original signal they let through to their output, and how much delay they introduce to each of these frequencies. 
A useful analogy is with equalizers in sound systems.
You can increase or decrease high, low, or middle range frequencies in a sound signal to eliminate noise. 
That is in fact very informative for what we do, since both the MAV and the aura should be obtained by eliminating high-frequency changes (daily fluctuations) and show low frequency components (week-to-week or month-to-month trends). 
Consequently, what we need are so-called low-pass filters, which allow low frequency components in the data signal and block high frequency components.
</p>
<p>
  Low-pass filters are parameterized primarily by their
  <em>
    cutoff frequency
  </em>
  , which is the frequency threshold beyond which they don&#8217;t let any components through. 
In our updated algorithms, we chose a cutoff frequency such that data components which fluctuate within a 20-day window are suppressed. 
For the aura, we chose a larger fluctuation period (hence a smaller cutoff frequency) of 20 days to 500 days, dynamically chosen with the number of visible datapoints to optimize its visual appearance and utility. 
The result is what you see in the following before/after shots:
</p>
<p>
  <img
    class=\\"aligncenter\\"
    src=\\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9928/167474342-4bb5bb54-50fe-42ec-99e0-366d458eb043.png\\"
  >
</p>
<p>
  There were key technical issues we had to address in getting these graphs. 
The first fundamental problem is associated with the fact that both FIR and IIR filters introduce what is called a &#8220;group delay&#8221; on the input, such that the output signal always lags behind the input signal. 
This was precisely the problem with the original MAV line. 
One cannot eliminate this issue in signal processing applications where your output cannot depend on
  <em>
    future
  </em>
  data (i.e. they have to be causal), but since Beeminder has all your data (all your data belong to us!) we do not have to abide by causality and can apply the same filter once forwards (introducing a delay of +D) and once backwards (with a delay of -D), resulting in an output signal with no delay! 
This is how we make the MAV line much more closely follow your data compared to its performance before.
</p>
<p>
  The second fundamental issue that plagued the use of these filters was &#8220;initialization&#8221;. 
Since IIR filters have internal state, they need to be properly initialized to make sure that the initial parts of the output also closely mirror the input. 
The need to also apply the filter backwards makes this more challenging since the last part of the data becomes the &#8220;initial state&#8221; for this backwards application. 
Our solution to this problem was to first shift all datapoints with an affine function so that they start and end at zero 
(i.e.
  <code>
    nd[i] = d[i] - (d[0]+i/N*(d[N]-d[0]))
  </code>
  ), 
and add a sufficient number of zeroes to the end of this data sequence to ensure a smooth ending for the filtered signal. 
Following filtering (i.e. ndf = iir_filter(nd)), original data values were recovered by applying the inverse of this adjustment 
(i.e.
  <code>
    df[i] = ndf[i] + (d[0]+i/N*(d[N]-d[0]))
  </code>
  ).
</p>
<p>
  Finally, a small but important requirement for the applicability of these filters is that data needs to be uniformly sampled (i.e. one datapoint every day), which is of course not always true for Beeminder goals. 
We remedy this small problem by using linear interpolation to fill in the gaps between successive datapoints which are separated by more than one day.
</p>
<p>

  Economists have been wondering for at least half a century why we don&#8217;t see more use of
  <a href=\\"http://beeminder.com/commitpoll.html\\">
    commitment devices in the real world
  </a>
  .
In 1955, one economist
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"RHS1\\"
    href=\\"#RHS\\"
  >
    [1]
  </a>
  speculated that the reason is risk and uncertainty, &#8220;both as to future tastes and future opportunities.&#8221;
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"CD1\\"
    href=\\"#CD\\"
  >
    [2]
  </a>
  We&#8217;ve been thinking hard about how to solve that problem &#8212; how to use commitment devices with minimal risk that you&#8217;ll regret it &#8212; and we have a multi-pronged approach worked out.
</p>
<p>
  We&#8217;re now going to lay out one of those prongs: a generous clause in the standard Beeminder commitment contract that lets you immediately pause your yellow brick road if something truly unexpected happens.
It&#8217;s a tricky balancing act though. You want something solid enough that you&#8217;ve truly committed yourself to your goal and can&#8217;t weasel out whenever a friend bakes some brownies (or whatever).
But you also want to retain as much flexibility as possible.
</p>
<p>
  To that end, here&#8217;s the current version of Beeminder&#8217;s
  <a href=\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_majeure\\">
    force majeure
  </a>
  clause:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    If something truly unexpected happens, such as physical injury, that prevents you from staying on your yellow brick road you can make your road immediately become flat.
To mitigate this otherwise abusable loophole, there are two conditions on invoking the force majeure clause (also known as the SOS clause).
    <br>
    &nbsp;
    <br>
    First, you have to notify Beeminder before you officially lose.
Preferably send an email to
    <a href=\\"mailto:support@beeminder.com\\">
      support@beeminder.com
    </a>
    but if you&#8217;re in the hospital or something and that&#8217;s not possible, text or, if really necessary, call 646-535-BEEM.
You can also tweet to
    <a href=\\"http://twitter.com/bmndr\\">
      @bmndr
    </a>
    .
Or if the emergency is so severe that it&#8217;s not reasonable to notify Beeminder before you lose, you can provide a doctor&#8217;s note or death certificate or similar within 14 days.
    <br>
    &nbsp;
    <br>
    The second condition is that you explain in 140 characters what happened that warrants the exemption.
A panel of disinterested judges will determine whether your excuse is legitimate, i.e., whether it really couldn&#8217;t have been anticipated and whether an exemption is within the spirit of this contract.
The point of the 140-character limit is both to make it simple for the judges and because the excuse has to be something stark and obvious like &#8220;I broke my leg&#8221;, not some kind of convoluted confluence of craziness at work and bad luck.
An excuse at all resembling &#8220;I got really busy&#8221; won&#8217;t fly.
    <br>
    &nbsp;
    <br>
    The litmus test for whether an excuse is legitimate is &#8220;Had I considered the possibility of the Unexpected Thing happening, would I have specified an exemption in the original contract?&#8221;
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  We&#8217;ve revised that many times, usually to make it more generous as we&#8217;ve found that no one seems to have much inclination to abuse it, even with high-stakes contracts.
That may be because we have a somewhat tight-knit group of beta users trying this stuff out.
But even as we scale up we&#8217;re inclined to err on the side of being too generous with the SOS clause.
After all, if someone wants to be a lame-o weasel about it they can just have their money back.

  Several distinctly non-weaselly beta users have expressed the fear that if push came to shove they&#8217;re not really sure they wouldn&#8217;t weasel.
Well, the fact that they&#8217;re worried about it puts a bound on how bad this problem can be.
Namely, they very much don&#8217;t want to have to weasel and that itself is pretty good motivation to stay on the yellow brick road and keep the question moot.

  <strong>
    Here’s how Beeminder co-founder Bethany Soule describes the Web-based, incentivized task tracker:
  </strong>
  “When I met my co-founder, Daniel Reeves, he was in the doldrums of dissertation writing. That’s when we started concocting a series of incentive schemes and productivity hacks called the Voluntary Harassment Program. It was so effective that he finished his Ph.D. that year and then asked me to marry him. After that, we built a simple website for friends that, paired with small side bets, became indispensible for tracking all sorts of goals. The project evolved into Beeminder. It’s a motivational tool where you pledge money to stay on track to meet any goal. We show your progress using a digital yellow brick road, and we integrate with popular fitness and productivity sites to help you keep pace with your achievements. The way we motivate you is simple: If you miss a milestone, we take the money you pledged—which can range from $5 to several hundred dollars. We’ll even let your Twitter followers know you’ve fallen behind. Most goals are fitness-related, but some use Beeminder to boost productivity at work or fulfill lifelong goals like learning to play guitar. We use it to guarantee at least one improvement to the site each day. We’ve made more than 600 since we launched, and we’re just getting started.”

  Previously on the Beeminder Blog we described a thought experiment for

    how to tell if you&#8217;ve written a functional spec
  </a>
  . It was like a nonconstructive proof that you&#8217;ve written one.
Is it the plausible output of turning the final source code into prose and subtracting everything irrelevant to your users?
By popular demand (among a small but very smart subset of you), we&#8217;ve expanded that into a handy checklist you can go through as you&#8217;re spec&#8217;ing.
This is once again heavily inspired by Joel Spolsky&#8217;s classic series, 
&#8220;

    Painless Functional Specifications
  </a>
  &#8221;.
</p>
<h3>
  1. Front Matter
</h3>
<p>
  After the title, include 
the author, 
a last-modified date, and 
the current
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/specs/\\"
    title=\\"Yes, this is another link to our previous post about writing functional specs because it also defined the Spec Spectrum, where 0.0 is an elevator pitch and 1.0 is production code, with a fully functional spec at 0.5\\"
  >
    spec level
  </a>
  (0 to 0.5).
That serves as a disclaimer and as expectations management.
</p>
<h3>
  2. State the Problem
</h3>
<p>
  This helps overcome initial writer&#8217;s block, for one thing.
More importantly, making this part very clear can totally change what happens in the rest of the spec, including the rest of the spec not being written at all if you decide the problem is not one you need to solve after all.
</p>
<h3>
  3. Nongoals
</h3>
<p>
  State at least one feature you won&#8217;t include, 
a use case you won&#8217;t consider, or 
something more general like not caring about performance or aesthetics.
</p>
<h3>
  4. Overview
</h3>
<p>
  Write an overview / abstract / executive summary / tl;dr / precis.
This might be a wild guess initially.
You can keep changing it as you figure out what to build.
Which writing the rest of the spec helps you do!

  </a>
  .)
</p>
<h3>
  5. Open Questions
</h3>
<p>
  Put an &#8220;Open Questions&#8221; section at the end for dumping everything you&#8217;re not sure about.
All of those things need answers or to be moved to a &#8220;Future Work&#8221; section before you have a functional spec.
You want to start this before you get to the meat of the document because it&#8217;s invaluable as a place to dump what-ifs that you&#8217;re not ready to think through yet.
Otherwise those can constantly derail you and make the spec-writing overwhelming.
</p>
<h3>
  6. Use Cases
</h3>
<p>
  Describe a use case in so much detail that it helps to give the hypothetical user a name.
Usually you want to do this for every possible stereotypical user, like, in Beeminder&#8217;s case,
Diligent Debbie with a do-more goal to dig ditches and 
Lazy Larry with a do-less goal for lounging around looking at lolcats.
</p>
<h3>
  7. &#128514;
</h3>
<p>
  Make a joke or make something rhyme or add an easter egg or do
  <em>
    something
  </em>
  that makes your spec fun to read.
Emojis if you&#8217;re desperate I guess?
</p>
<h3>
  8. Pseudocode
</h3>
<p>
  Write at least a line of pseudocode for some of the business logic, including
  <a
    href=\\"http://messymatters.com/nominology\\"
    title=\\"How to pick names for things\\"
  >

  </a>
  for relevant data structures or database fields.
See

    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/specs/\\"

To be less circular, think of business logic as the core algorithm being implemented, not counting the UI or the database stuff — the things that wouldn’t change if you implemented your thing with pencil and paper or some future alien technology or anything in between.\\"
  >
    our previous post
  </a>
  for what we mean by business logic.
</p>
<h3>
  9. Web/UI copy
</h3>
<p>
  Include a snippet of webcopy for some screen, popup, or error message.
</p>
<h3>
  10. Sidebars
</h3>
<p>
  Add at least one sidebar for a technical note or historical debate about alternatives.
Anything not of interest to your whole audience &#8212; programmers plus bosses plus sufficiently fanatical users &#8212; should be sidebarred, i.e., made visually obvious that it can be skipped without hurting the narrative flow.
</p>
<h3>
  11. Decisiveness!
</h3>
<p>
  Purge every &#8220;then we could either&#8221; and &#8220;maybe we should&#8221; until the whole thing is coherent and decisive.
This is hard to do.
I recommend taking it to the extreme of rephrasing everything from future to present tense.
The spec describes what is, not what could be or should be or will be.

    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/docdriven\\"

  is relevant here.)
</p>
<h3>
  12. Gedankenexperiment
</h3>
<p>
  You can tell this one&#8217;s important because it&#8217;s in German.
And because it has its own whole Beeminder blog post.
Do the code-pasting thought experiment from

    brilliant thing Joel Spolsky said about them
  </a>
  , and Bee nodding absent-mindedly and sticking her head back in the guts of Beeminder&#8217;s code.
</p>
<p>
  In one of those one-sided conversations I came up with a thought experiment for answering the perennial question:
&#8220;OK, I wrote some things about what we should implement &#8212; how do I know if it counts as a functional spec?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
  Here&#8217;s a way!
Consider a nifty thing you personally built and deployed and use (or someone uses). 
In Bee&#8217;s case maybe it&#8217;s 
some circumscribed part of Beeminder or 
her old taskbot or 
some other fun side project she&#8217;s hacked up.
Now imagine literally pasting the entire source code into a text document. 
(I&#8217;m imagining a lot of very skeptical looks and this might sound crazier before it gets saner but bear with me!)
</p>
<p>
  Ok, next, imagine going through that code line by line converting it to readable prose. 
Only delete a line of code from the document when it&#8217;s been covered by prose.
Or when the prose acknowledges the existence of implementation details not worth describing.
(This is the saner part.)
</p>
<p>
  The idea is that for every decision, big or small, that you had to make when writing that code, your spec makes it too.
Sometimes a chunk of code has no actual decisions in it and can be replaced with a single sentence. 
&#8220;Do such-and-such in the obvious way.&#8221;
Other bits of code are the opposite. 
Like so-called business logic which can be preserved verbatim. 
Something like &#8220;decide if a goal is derailed with the following function&#8230;&#8221;
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;We can expand the continuum further, all the way from elevator pitch to production code&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  In fact, a good definition of
  <a
    href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_logic\\"
    title=\\"Wikipedia makes it sound really boring; maybe just read my version instead of clicking this!\\"
  >
    business logic
  </a>
  , though a bit circular in this context, is: code that the functional spec should include.
To be less circular, think of business logic as the core algorithm being implemented, not counting the UI or the database stuff &#8212; the things that wouldn&#8217;t change if you implemented your thing with pencil and paper or some future alien technology or anything in between.
(Business logic needn&#8217;t have anything to do with business and we should probably use the synonym &#8220;domain logic&#8221; instead but &#8220;business logic&#8221; seems more common.)
The point here is that it&#8217;s critical in a functional spec to fully describe the business logic, preferably with pseudocode or even snippets of actual code, if it&#8217;s clean enough.
</p>
<p>
  So to answer the question we started with, when you have a candidate spec for a new thing you&#8217;re going to build, imagine if you could reach into the future and grab the final source code of it.
Now imagine going through that process of prose-ifying the entirety of it.
Is the spec you actually wrote a plausible output of that process?
</p>
<h3>
  That sounds like a technical spec, not a functional spec
</h3>
<p>
  Those are just two points on a continuum!
In this thought experiment, for a purely functional spec, you throw away all code except the business logic.
If it&#8217;s not user-visible then axe it entirely; if it is, replace it with a prosaic description of its impact on the user. 
Further along the spectrum is a technical spec, where every non-obvious decision is included. 
And in fact we can expand the continuum further in both directions, all the way from elevator pitch to full production code:
</p>
<p>
  <img
    class=\\"aligncenter\\"
    alt=\\"The Spec Spectrum\\"
    title=\\"The colors have no significance here (that we've thought of so far)\\"
    src=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/specspecspec-1.png\\"
  >
</p>
<p>
  Starting on the left &#8212; 0% of a spec &#8212; we have the elevator pitch.
Namely, the version you can describe in the amount of time it takes to ride an elevator.
We could also call it the spitball but that sounds gross.
Fleshing out that spitball (sorry) gets you to the Powerpoint version &#8212; 10% of the way to a final product &#8212; with lots of explicit hand-waving over the details.
But at least you&#8217;re thinking about use cases and sketching how things will look.
The (arbitrarily chosen) 25% mark is where it gets interesting.
This is how you might write a spec if you&#8217;re a noob.
It seems like a complete spec but is full of hand-waving that you don&#8217;t notice you&#8217;re doing.
(This is what my thought experiment aims to help with.)
Double that Seeming Spec (realistically much more than doubling if measured in time and effort) and you&#8217;re finally halfway to the eventual code: a full functional spec.
Go another half-distance to your goal &#8212; 75% &#8212; and that&#8217;s where I&#8217;m putting the technical spec.
It&#8217;s not too far from a prototype or reference implementation (90%).

  This is still pie-in-the-sky philosophical navel-gazing but it makes me very happy.
Not just because I love pie-in-the-sky philosophical navel-gazing 
(we could say Product Vision if we wanted to sound more respectable)
but because a couple years ago this sounded preposterously theoretical and fantastical and now it sounds inevitable and kind of obvious.
We are making steady progress here.
</p>
<p>
  I think it&#8217;s worth articulating this now, well ahead of when we&#8217;re ready to implement it, because it&#8217;s helpful to have the mental model of the Platonic ideal of Beeminder.
(I&#8217;m still trying my hardest to avoid business-speak like &#8220;product vision&#8221; and &#8220;roadmap&#8221;.)
I believe that with the right interface, this can be elegant and simpler and clearer and intuitiver &#8212; a boon for both newbees and veterans.
</p>
<p>
  Alright, enough buildup, &#8220;bright red staircase&#8221; means that the bright red line that Beeminder draws on your graph &#8212; the line you must keep all your datapoints on the right side of
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"YBR1\\"
    href=\\"#YBR\\"
  >
    [1]
  </a>
  &#8212; should reflect exactly what the deadlines are.
If there&#8217;s a deadline every day &#8212; as in the current Beeminder &#8212; then we&#8217;d draw the red line not as a smooth slope but with 24-hour-long horizontal segments punctuated by vertical jumps at your daily deadline.
</p>
<p>
  The first advantage of this is that it becomes literally true that crossing the bright red line means derailing.
We already talk as if that&#8217;s true but in reality, with the non-stair-steppy way we draw the red line, you can in fact be on the wrong side of the bright red line as long as you get your datapoint back on the right side before your deadline hits.
Midnight or whatever time you&#8217;ve set as your official end-of-day.
</p>
<p>
  But the real advantage is how elegantly this generalizes&#8230;
</p>
<h3>
  Weekly Goals (or Monthly etc)
</h3>
<p>
  Newbees commonly expect to be able to set up weekly goals.
Like if they create a goal to cook 3 meals per week, they feel very put out when Beeminder expects them to have cooked at least 0.43 meals the very next day.
They expect to be able to procrastinate for 7 days and cook all 3 meals on the last day of the week.
Mostly people are wrong to want that
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"FLAT1\\"
    href=\\"#FLAT\\"
  >
    [2]
  </a>
  and just last week we
  <a
    href=\\"http://beeminder.com/changelog#4017\\"
    title=\\"Entry in our changelog aka list of User-Visible Improvements\\"
  >
    made an important change
  </a>
  to the goal creation interface to force you to reframe &#8220;X per week&#8221; as &#8220;X/7 per day&#8221;.
Hopefully that alleviates the confusion and misunderstanding.
</p>
<p>
  But the point is, with the bright red staircase, we could actually support that.
Instead of day-long flat spots we&#8217;d just have week-long flat spots.
In principle you could make

    href=\\"https://stickk.com\\"
    title=\\"Our esteemed competitor who we trash-talk enough that it&#39;s fair to wonder how sincerely we esteem them\\"
  >
    StickK
  </a>
  -like contracts where you just have to get your novel written by the end of the year, with no intermediate progress enforced at all.
We think that&#8217;s pretty un-Beeminder-y so we&#8217;re more interested in the other direction.
</p>
<h3>
  Hourly Goals (or Minutely etc)
</h3>
<p>
  I&#8217;m excited about having work goals where I have a beemergency every hour during the work day, 9am-5pm, and then flat the rest of the time. 
I’m also weird enough to like the idea of fully continuous goals:
There&#8217;s no fixed deadline at all, you just get some amount above the red line and that defines exactly how long till you next collide with the line. 
If you want to be able to get a full night&#8217;s sleep, you better do enough work to buy yourself 8 hours of safety buffer. 
It&#8217;ll be great.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;Weekends-off would just be one more special case of the bright red staircase&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  (I know, I know, this sounds awful to many of you, and it may well be awful for many goals. 
I have an elaborate defense of it for some kinds of goals but we needn&#8217;t go down that rabbit hole.
The default would surely be daily and you&#8217;d opt in to anything else.)
</p>
<p>
  The real point is that the bright red staircase is fully flexible and general, while ironically having fewer moving parts. 
Weekends-off would just be one more special case of the bright red staircase.
</p>
<h3>
  Weekday-ly Goals (or Other Weirdo Cases)
</h3>
<p>
  Inbox goals might need to be a stegosaurus rather than a staircase:
You want your number of messages to go down during the day (and during the week) but allow your inbox to grow overnight (and during the weekend).
</p>
<p>
  For Do Less goals, the continuous version may well make sense.
If you&#8217;re beeminding servings of sugar, for example, the whole concept of a daily deadline doesn&#8217;t really make sense.
There&#8217;s just always, at every moment in time, some hard cap on how much sugar you can eat.
</p>
<p>
  And of course nothing prevents staircases within staircases.
You could have weekly stair steps with deadlines on Fridays plus daily deadlines at 5pm on workdays plus hourly deadlines throughout the workday.
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"FRACTAL1\\"
    href=\\"#FRACTAL\\"
  >
    [3]
  </a>
</p>
<p>
  Again, the beauty of this is greater consistency, simplicity, and generality.
What&#8217;s currently a collection of settings &#8212; deadline time, weekends-off, rate units &#8212; all become captured by the piecewise-linear function that is the bright red line.
</p>
<h3>
  Flappy Birds, The Past, and The Future
</h3>
<p>
  I like to imagine the bright red staircase as a slow-motion game of Flappy Bird.
The bird flies along horizontally (or upward at a constant rate in the case of Do Less goals) and if you don&#8217;t do anything it will crash into the cliff that is the next stair step.
You keep that from happening by entering data, which is like flapping your bird upward to clear each stair step.
In the continuous case, without stair steps, the dynamics are the same.
By default you&#8217;ll collide with the bright red line.
Adding data prevents that.
</p>

  A year and a half ago we navigated the

  .
That now feels obvious and natural and has made it so much easier to reason about how the the bright red staircase should work.
So when is the bright red staircase going to happen?
We currently predict after 2022.
The good news is we&#8217;re getting there inexorably.

<p>
  While waiting for a Beeminder beta account, I tried using StickK to help me lose some fat. StickK is a brilliant concept and I hope they succeed in a big way, but I don&#8217;t like their weekly weigh-ins, for two reasons:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      It&#8217;s way too easy to
      <a
        href=\\"http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2008/01/18/how-to-cut-weight/\\"
        title=\\"Warning: serious insanity; click at your own risk\\"
      >
        temporarily and unhealthfully cut weight by dehydrating yourself
      </a>
      with a hot bath and other techniques.  Daily weigh-ins with Beeminder would be much harder to game. (Not that your humble narrator would ever consider seeking out and making use of such information merely to avoid losing a substantial sum of money, of course, but other less strong-willed people might be tempted.)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      With StickK, to make absolutely sure you come in under your target weight on the reporting date (if you&#8217;re not going to cut weight by dehydration) you actually have to make sure you weigh a pound or so below your target weight to allow for normal fluctuations on the day of your weigh in. Beeminder&#8217;s approach of daily weigh-ins coupled with the ingenious yellow brick road keeps you on track better while keeping you from stressing out about normal fluctuations in weight.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  As an aside, I was confused by StickK&#8217;s screens for creating a commitment contract. There&#8217;s no final confirmation step the way there is in a normal online sales/checkout process. Every screen simply has a button at the bottom that says &#8220;next step&#8221;, while I was doing things like entering credit card details and inviting friends to support me, and I wasn&#8217;t sure when the contract had actually been created and when I would no longer have a chance to edit the contract details.
</p>
<p>
  There&#8217;s not a lot of precedent for creating a commitment contract online, but for now I would suggest adopting eBay&#8217;s general approach. Right before the contract is created, the web site could say something like, &#8220;You are about to enter into a contract to do X, including making reports over the internet on the following dates (with a link to fine print about grace periods and such). If you fail you will pay $X per reporting period, for a potential total of $Y. Are you absolutely sure you want to do this?&#8221;

<p>
  You know how it used to be that you only got three goals on Beeminder&#8217;s free plan?
Well stop the presses! 
Now you get three goals on Beeminder&#8217;s free plan, and you earn extra goals by derailing existing goals.
</p>
<p>
  Does that still sound kind of restrictive?
Dare I say&#8230; stingy?
</p>
<p>
  (The bee puns, in addition to the first three goals, are free.)
</p>
<p>
  Let us convince you with the soothing tones of our newbee-facing webcopy / FAQ item / help doc&#8230;
</p>
<h3>
  How many goals can I create?
</h3>
<p>
  Initially just three! 
Why so stingy? 
Well, hear us out. 
We promise it&#8217;s not as restrictive as it sounds. 
(And you
  <em>
    can
  </em>
  jump straight to unlimited goals with a premium plan, however that&#8217;s
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/focus\\"
    title=\\"Strategy Memo from 2021 about how we&#39;re pledge-focused now\\"
  >
    not necessary
  </a>
  for the beginning Beeminderer.)
Mainly we believe that you should start slowly. 
Adding too many goals right off the bat is a sure path to overwhelm and rage quitting.
But even better &#8212; you earn additional goals when you hit good Beeminder-y milestones! 
For starters when you derail a non-zero-pledged goal.
</p>
<p>
  Wait, what? 
Are we trying to bribe you to fail at your goals? 
Not at all, I mean, well, we&#8217;re kind of bribing you to derail but
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/defail\\"
    title=\\"In case you like going deep in the weeds on Beeminder philosophy\\"
  >
    derailing is not failing
  </a>
  .
More than &#8220;not failing&#8221;, even.
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/nailingit\\"
    title=\\"See also “Paying Is Not Punishment” for another blog post turning “Derailing Is Not Failing” up to eleven\\"
  >
    Derailing it is nailing it
  </a>
  ! It&#8217;s like how if you never make mistakes then you&#8217;re not learning. 
Pushing yourself is the point and that will mean occasional derailments and that&#8217;s fine. 
Creating a ton of goals off the bat is a common recipe for actual failure &#8212; the kind where you get overwhelmed and quit altogether. 
(Another form of actual failure is setting your goals so unambitiously that you never derail but also never do more than you would&#8217;ve without Beeminder, which is part of our derailing-it-is-nailing-it argument.)
</p>
<p>
  Anyway, so that&#8217;s partly why we parcel out additional goals so stingily. 
If you still want another one after derailing then you&#8217;re probably ready for it. 
Also it&#8217;s how we make money. 
Again, you can pay for unlimited goals directly with a premium plan.
</p>
<p>
  Whatever your goal limit 
(check it in
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/settings/account#defaults\\"
    title=\\"The New Goal Defaults tab\\"
  >
    account settings
  </a>
  ), it only applies to active (non-archived) goals.
So the other way to create another goal is to archive existing ones.
</p>
<p>
  We&#8217;re also happy to bump up your goal limit in exchange for feedback. Get in touch!
</p>
<h3>
  What happens if I downgrade from a premium plan?
</h3>
<p>
  We don&#8217;t rescind goals you already have.
But it is possible to wind up in a situation where you have more goals than your nominal limit.
In that case you won&#8217;t be able to make any new goals for the time being, but your limit will still grow with each derail payment, so you may be able to create more after a while.
Archiving existing goals, emailing us to ask for more (with feedback), or re-upping on premium are all also legit ways to get more goals.
</p>
<h2>
  Derails are just the first step. Next: the world!
</h2>
<p>
  Earning more goals when you derail is fine and well. 
But it got some of us excited about a more general sort of &#8220;earn goals by doing beeminder-y things&#8221; kind of system.
</p>
<p>
  We brainstormed on the community Discord and in beemails and came up with a bunch of great ideas for the kinds of things we could hand out goals for.
(And perhaps someday badges? If Bee ever gets in an Illustrator sort of mood.)

(Again, this one&#8217;s already true in the status quo!)
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Another reason we may want to expand to a more robust, complex set of goal-earning milestones is the possibility that incrementing your goal limit with every sting could cheapen the benefit.
If your number of free goals far outpaces any reasonable number of goals you&#8217;d ever create &#8212; and we kind of think it should because

    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/nailingit\\"
    title=\\"When you have a hammer, everything looks like you are nailing it\\"
  >
    derailing it is nailing it
  </a>
  &#8212; that could feel unsatisfying.
If so, that could be our excuse to introduce these other milestones and only give out free goals for a subset of derails, like the first one at each new pledge level.
</p>
<p>
  All that said, we like giving you goals, and we want you to be successful at beeminding things.
If you stub your toe on the goal limit we wanna hear about it.

<h3>
  So how do I use it with Beeminder?
</h3>
<p>
  We&#8217;re starting out simple. 
If your profile is public, you can beemind your number of pages read. 
We&#8217;ll start by pulling in your current number, and then each day we&#8217;ll grab your current total, plotting it on an odometer goal for you. 
To add data, just go to The StoryGraph and mark books as read, or add reading progress to a book you have marked as currently reading.
</p>
<p>
  On the Beeminder side, it&#8217;s all automated.
</p>
<p>
  If the pages-read metric isn&#8217;t currently exciting to you, we&#8217;d love to hear what is. 
Let us know about what you dream of tracking, and we&#8217;ll see what we can do and potentially add more metrics!

  It&#8217;s finally official!
Strava activities can now be automatically tracked with Beeminder!
</p>
<p>
  So, first of all, welcome
  <a
    href=\\"http://strava.com\\"
    title=\\"Strava tracks workouts via your phone and lets you compete with other people on standard running/biking/skating routes\\"

    Strava
  </a>
  users!
Beeminder takes a large goal, such as training for a marathon, and breaks it down into daily deadlines. 
Not by providing any insight into marathon training schedules (we assume you have other sources for that) but just by making those daily deadlines deadly serious.
Beeminding means committing to keep all your datapoints on track towards your goal every day or else pay a fine.
Beeminder displays your progress on a graph and sends you reminders about how much you need to do by when.
If you always stay on track, you never pay anything.
Despite the dead seriousness, we&#8217;re very friendly about this and guarantee that you&#8217;ll never go off track due to any technicality or confusion or injury.
(In case that friendliness defeats the point for you, you can opt in to weaselproofing, but now we&#8217;re getting ahead of ourselves.)
Beeminder&#8217;s ever-present threat of stinging you where it hurts (we mean your wallet) can be just the push you need to consistently stick with your training and achieve your fitness goals!
</p>
<p>
  The first thing you have to decide when creating a Beeminder goal is
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/whattomind\\"
    title=\\"Beeminder blog post on picking a metric to (bee)mind\\"
  >
    what you&#8217;re going to measure
  </a>
  .
You&#8217;ve got Strava to do the measuring so you can pick anything Strava keeps track of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    distance (in miles or kilometers)
  </li>
  <li>
    activity time (in total hours)
  </li>
  <li>
    number of activities
  </li>
  <li>
    calories
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  You can track any (or all!) of a huge variety of activities from running to yoga to backcountry skiing!
</p>
<p>
  <img
    class=\\"aligncenter\\"

    title=\\"Andy picked the accompany emoji :)\\"
    src=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/strava-activities.png\\"
  >
</p>
<p>
  After that there are the questions about exactly how much you want to commit to and whether you want to be on the hook immediately or give yourself some initial safety buffer before Beeminder gets all harsh-mistress on you.
But once you&#8217;re set up, you shouldn&#8217;t have to touch Beeminder at all.
Just keep it happy by logging more time and distance on Strava.
</p>
<p>
  We&#8217;re really excited about this new integration!
And thanks to Strava for

  But before we go, a couple notes for Beeminder veterans.
First, if you&#8217;re a very long-time veteran you might know that 
Beeminder user Seth Herr made a prototype 3rd-party Strava+Beeminder integration several years ago, which did just enough to solve his own problem &#8212; syncing his Strava runs with Beeminder.
He then generalized it a bit and invited others to use it.
Unfortunately it then broke a few years ago.
But we love that this started with a user scratching an itch and are very proud to have an
  <a

    title=\\"One of our blog posts about our API, announcing a feature that made 3rd-party integrations no less powerful than official ones\\"
  >
    API
  </a>
  that makes such itch-scratching possible.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, this integration now has one feature none of the other Beeminder integrations do.
Namely, every datapoint has a link to the corresponding workout on Strava.
</p>

But whatever your twisted relationship with Nature and/or exercise, go forth!

enjoy daylight savings time while it lasts!
And as the days get short and you get lazy, Beeminder will be there nipping at your heels and cracking the whip.

  Beeminder is not just for the productivity-&uuml;ber-alles types who try polyphasic sleep and whatnot.
I mean, it can definitely accommodate that, if that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re into.
Stress can be valuable, we get it.
But what if you already have too much stress?
Should you avoid Beeminder?
We are very biased but sure don&#8217;t think so!
On the contrary, we think Beeminder is a powerful stress-reduction tool.
</p>
<p>
  For example, getting yourself to
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/study/\\"
    title=\\"Nicky&#39;s Secret To Beeminding Studying: It&#39;s About Time\\"
  >
    spread your studying out
  </a>
  over a semester.
That&#8217;s way less stressful than cramming for exams!
Or if Beeminder makes you pay attention to your Fitbit just enough to actually get in 10k steps a day.
Exercise is stress-reducing!
Or getting yourself to bed on time instead of repeatedly getting in

  I polled the weekly beemail subscribers:
Does Beeminder add stress to your life and do you view that as positive or negative?
The most common reaction was that it increases short-term stress but decreases long-term stress, for a net stress reduction.
Some people thought it does increase stress but it&#8217;s worth it, and others said it straight up reduces stress.
I think all of these are right and it really depends how you use Beeminder.
(And of course some people really shouldn&#8217;t use Beeminder.

  Here are my top ten favorite replies from Users Like You:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    &#8220;It reduces bad stress in the form of feeling overwhelmed and not feeling on top of things.&#8221;
  </li>
  <li>
    &#8220;It adds micro-stresses but removes much of the mega-stress. It&#8217;s the difference between &#8216;Ahh!! I have to get this little thing done by 5!!!&#8217; and &#8216;Ahhhhhhhh!!! I have to tell everyone I won&#8217;t be done with this project in time after all and hope they understand and that my life won&#8217;t be ruined for ever and ever!!!!&#8217;&#8221;
  </li>
  <li>
    &#8220;Way less stress than before, because I have solid evidence that I&#8217;m actually getting stuff done.&#8221;
  </li>
  <li>
    &#8220;Beeminder reduces stress in my life because it gets things out of my head. I don’t have to worry about how much or how little I’m doing something because I know Beeminder is keeping track. This is a very good thing.&#8221;
  </li>
  <li>
    &#8220;It causes stress but I also have a Beeminder goal where I track my stress level to make sure that it doesn&#8217;t get so high that I am being unproductively stressful.&#8221;
  </li>
  <li>
    &#8220;Setting smart and SMART goals, with realistic rates and learning to let goals go that I&#8217;m not passionate about has helped significantly. I still spend a lot of time, but it&#8217;s enjoyable, realistically attainable, and immensely satisfying when I finish for the day and have time to spare.&#8221;
  </li>
  <li>
    &#8220;Without Beeminder I would probably feel all the time that I&#8217;m not working enough. I would always be thinking &#8216;Hey! Shouldn&#8217;t you be doing something productive?!&#8217; With Beeminder I can clearly answer &#8216;No. My goals are in the green. I&#8217;ve done enough. I can relax now.&#8217;&#8221;
  </li>
  <li>
    &#8220;Definitely reduces my stress by keeping me on target for a variety of goals I know are good for me but in the past I would put off. It&#8217;s been a revelation since I&#8217;ve decided to use it (I won&#8217;t lie, I knew about it long before I had the guts to actually commit).&#8221;
  </li>
  <li>
    &#8220;Beeminder spreads stress over time. This sometimes makes me feel like I experience more stress because I think about it more often, but in reality it is just an effect of the stress being evenly distributed. If it wasn&#8217;t I would experience a lot of (negative) stress close to the deadline instead.&#8221;
  </li>
  <li>
    &#8220;In some ways Beeminder does add some stress to my life, but it is positive. For activities I enjoy though, Beeminder just reduces stress. I enjoy playing music and having a beemergency day is a great reason to stop whatever I&#8217;m doing and go practice, an activity which by itself reduces stress for me.&#8221;
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  My own approach as a Beeminder user is that I wake up every day and work my way down my Beeminder dashboard.
I see how it seems like it&#8217;d be stressful, waking up to a dozen or more goals in the red.
But a lot of those beemergencies are just-keep-swimming things. 
Like read two more pages of a certain book or write one more sentence of a blog post. 
Overall I&#8217;d say I&#8217;m trying to replicate the amount of stress I might have at a day job.

  , the previous iteration of which we&#8217;ve been using to collect your payment info on Beeminder for over 11 years now.
This is the tale of how it took us four years to migrate to that new version.
</p>
<p>
  Alright, it did not literally take four bee-years of coding time to complete this. 
Much of it was just

  </a>
  crowding out time spent on it. 
But over the past year, as more and more of our users were impacted by the European 
Strong Customer Authentication regulation, it gradually became urgent for us to get up to date and support
  <a
    href=\\"https://stripe.com/docs/payments/3d-secure\\"
    title=\\"Stripe&#39;s blurb: For extra fraud protection, 3D Secure (3DS) requires customers to complete an additional verification step with the card issuer when paying. Typically, you direct the customer to an authentication page on their bank’s website, and they enter a password associated with the card or a code sent to their phone. This process is familiar to customers through the card networks’ brand names, such as Visa Secure and Mastercard Identity Check. The Strong Customer Authentication regulation in Europe requires the use of 3DS for card payments. 3DS is optional in other regions but you can still use it as a tool to reduce fraud.\\"

</p>
<p>
  Our hoary codebase had also accumulated technical debt over the last decade or so that meant we had several prerequisite updates to make before we could actually get started on updating the version of Stripe Checkout itself.
</p>
<h3>
  1. Technical Prerequisite: update how we access your stored card info
</h3>
<p>
  At some point Stripe changed the API for what they call a stored payment method, and switched from calling it a &#8220;source&#8221; to calling it a &#8220;payment method&#8221;. 
So we had to start with a simple refactor from using their older moniker to the newer one.
This was mostly a search-and-replace; we just also needed to update all of our existing customers on Stripe to copy their stored &#8220;sources&#8221; over to &#8220;payment methods&#8221; as well.
</p>
<p>
  This was totally behind the scenes and made no user-visible differences.
</p>
<h3>
  2. Another Technical Prerequisite: update how we draw money from a stored payment method
</h3>
<p>
  The next step was to update our code away from using Stripe&#8217;s

  >
    Payment Intent API
  </a>
  .
The legacy Charge API doesn&#8217;t support customers in India, bank requests for authentication, or secure customer authentication.
Meaning that many of the cards we collect through the new Checkout would be unusable with the older Charges API that we were using, 
but the Payment Intents are backward-compatible and work fine with the old stored cards.
</p>
<h4>
  2a. Sidetrack from the Prereq: update how we charge for derails
</h4>
<p>
  As part of migrating to Payment Intents, we needed to refactor how we charge for derails.
This was another user-invisible refactoring project.
</p>
<p>
  Charging for derails is the oldest piece of payment infrastructure in the Beeminder codebase, and it was done slightly differently from how we create other charges (like 
premium payments,
  <a
    href=\\"https://api.beeminder.com/#charge\\"
    title=\\"Yes, we have an API endpoint to charge yourself an arbitrary amount of money. Some hardcore Beeminder users use it to set up their own automated commitment devices.\\"
  >
    API-created charges
  </a>
  , and various failed experiments like
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/freebees/\\"
    title=\\"Blog post from 2014: “Freebees: Not Actually Free”\\"
  >
    paying for freebees
  </a>
  , or running contests.)
</p>
<p>
  Anyhow, we had two different ways we were creating charges, and before we switched over to Stripe&#8217;s Payment Intents, I spent a week isolated in an AirBnB,
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/maniac/\\"
    title=\\"Old blog post about my first official Maniac Week\\"
  >
    maniac-style
  </a>
  , refactoring the payments code so that we only had one way that we create charges.
</p>
<p>
  (This is of course ignoring the pox on our codebase that is PayPal payments&#8230; uff-dah.
More on this at the end of the post.)
</p>
<h4>
  2b. Detour complete: switch to using Payment Intents
</h4>
<p>
  Finally, I switched things over to using Payment Intents.
It&#8217;s still a bit dodgy what with the PayPal Pox and I can&#8217;t wait to heal that up with some modern medicine.
I hear that you can set up PayPal as a payment method in Google Pay, but maybe only in the US?
</p>
<h3>
  3. Stripe Payment Elements
</h3>
<p>
  Then finally! I was ready to upgrade Stripe Checkout. 
But I was bothered that the new version of Checkout involves a redirect to a Stripe hosted page, instead of just being an update to the javascripty popup that we&#8217;d had from the old version of Checkout.
</p>
<p>
  For comparison, here&#8217;s the old version:
  <img
    class=\\"aligncenter\\"
    src=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screen-Shot-2023-02-09-at-22.58.48.png\\"
    alt=\\"Popup window with credit card fields\\"
    title=\\"The old version of Stripe Checkout, for nostalgia's sake.\\"
    width=\\"450px\\"
  >
</p>
<p>
  And the new version:
  <img
    class=\\"aligncenter\\"
    src=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/newcheckoutstripe.png\\"
    alt=\\"Other popup window with credit card fields\\"
    title=\\"The new version of Stripe Checkout, for completeness's sake.\\"
    width=\\"450px\\"
  >
</p>
<p>
  That redirect maybe makes more sense when what you&#8217;re talking about is a shopping cart experience, but it felt pretty weird to me in our context, where you&#8217;re just storing a card with us to be charged at some later date.
Stranger still when the redirect is part of the process of signing up for a new account. 
Because yes, we collect a card up front when you sign up for Beeminder.
</p>
<p>
  But lo! Stripe has an alternative to Checkout; they have their
  <a
    href=\\"https://stripe.com/docs/payments/elements\\"
    title=\\"Stripe&#39;s blurb: Create your own checkout flows with prebuilt UI components.\\"
  >
    Elements API
  </a>
  , which is a handy Javascript library with a bunch of prebuilt UI components for collecting payments (or setting up a payment method for future usage, as in our case).
You essentially use some Javascript to drop in a whole ready-built widget, and another call to the Javascript library to submit it back to Stripe for packaging.
</p>
<p>
  Back in 2019 when this saga started, Elements had fewer bells and whistles, but in the intervening four years of not getting around to updating our Stripe code, Stripe had been adding to Elements.
Now it&#8217;s got a single &#8220;Payment Element&#8221; you can mount into the page with a line or two of Javascript, and then Stripe dynamically figures out, based on the client&#8217;s locale, what types of payment options to offer them, and in what order.
And new payment method types can be added with just a line of configuration (just like Checkout).
</p>
<p>
  But&#8230; turns out that using a Payment Element to set up future payments still requires a redirect. 
That&#8217;s part of 3D Secure that you can&#8217;t guarantee a way out of. 
Sometimes a payment method or a specific bank won&#8217;t require it, but you&#8217;ve got to handle it when it is required.
</p>
<p>
  Which means I find myself tumbling down a new rabbit hole (within a rabbit hole). 
The amount of work required to use Payment Elements in our registration form is starting to balloon. 
I&#8217;m starting to think about handling that redirect, and wondering how to store the user&#8217;s registration info that they have dutifully entered into the form already.
I&#8217;ve got browser local storage, and cookies, and URL parameters, and Stripe metadata dancing through my head.
I&#8217;m wondering if I need to design a new API endpoint for creating users. 
This is starting to look more complex than it did at first blush.
</p>
<h3>
  4. Get practical, and decide to use the expedient Checkout
</h3>
<p>
  And suddenly Checkout&#8217;s redirect doesn&#8217;t look so bad.
The redirect that I&#8217;m not getting out of anyway.
</p>
<p>
  In fact, Danny even suggests that perhaps the redirect is better than having a credit card form that looks like a seamless part of our signup form?
Perhaps Stripe knows best.
Perhaps users will think that
  <em>
    we&#8217;re
  </em>
  the ones storing their payment info if it&#8217;s part of the same form.
You never know.
</p>
<p>
  (PS: Support Czar Nicky confirms that users totally have commonly worried that this was the case.)
</p>
<p>
  Using Checkout I get to:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Avoid writing new Javascript code
  </li>
  <li>
    Use the existing code for handling user signup
  </li>
  <li>
    Actually remove some error-handling code from the signup page
  </li>
  <li>
    Not worry about changes to, e.g., &#8220;Sign up with Google&#8221; (because, see above: I&#8217;m using the existing code for handling signup)
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  So far I&#8217;ve mostly only talked about Checkout in the context of the signup page.
For users who were grandfathered in before we
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/commitwall\\"
    title=\\"Commitwall: No More Beeminding Without A Way To Be Charged Money\\"
  >
    required adding a payment method as part of signing up
  </a>
  , there are also commitwalls (i.e., we ask for you to store a payment method) before you can sign up for premium, and as part of starting a goal.
We also allow you to change the payment method attached to your account from the payments page at any time.
New Checkout works with those scenarios as well.
</p>
<p>
  There was very little Javascript code for me to write. 
Mostly just un-writing. 
And this part only took about 9 days to do. 
I made the first commit on my &#8220;upgrade checkout with redirect style&#8221; on January 31st.

<h3>
  PayPal vs&#8230; everything else
</h3>
<p>
  Now that we&#8217;re using modern Stripe APIs, the next obvious step is more payment methods!
We&#8217;re planning a second, non-nerd blog post about all the new payment methods we&#8217;re now able to support. 
It includes Google Pay and Apple Pay so far. 
Hopefully it will be a big enough spoonful of sugar for any holdouts who may be sad about us dropping PayPal.
</p>
<p>
  But we&#8217;re pretty dead set on dropping PayPal.
We added support for it
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/paypal/\\"
    title=\\"Blog Announcement: Beeminder Adds PayPal as a Payment Option. But much of the blog post itself is lamenting the choice to support PayPal!\\"
  >
    in 2017
  </a>
  and have been regretting it ever since.
You might think if there are users who want to give us money and that&#8217;s where they have their money then we should, y&#8217;know, take it.
But it&#8217;s hard to overstate how much of a pain it&#8217;s been.
It&#8217;s not even a problem specific to PayPal necessarily, though they do make everything annoying compared to the joy that is Stripe.
It&#8217;s more that having an extra way to collect money from users makes every block of code that touches payments that much more complex. 
If-statements everywhere! 
And you know how we
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/magic/\\"
    title=\\"The Anti-Magic Principle aka If-Statements Considered Harmful\\"
  >
    hate those
  </a>
  .
Basically, supporting PayPal throughout this whole upgrade saga was another thick layer of tech debt molasses slowing everything down and it&#8217;s going to feel amazing to finally jettison it.
</p>
<p>
  We do want to do it as gently as possible, transitioning the PayPal users over to other payment methods rather than
  <em>
    literally
  </em>
  dropping support and losing those users.
But we will eventually pull the bandaid off.

<p>
  I&#8217;ve been promising a blog post about studying for ages, because when you have someone with three degrees under their belt (number four on the way!) hanging round doing support for a site that people often use for studying, asking them for the secrets of their success sounds like a no-brainer.
</p>
<p>
  I&#8217;ve been using Beeminder-like methods for studying since megalodon swam the seas.
 
When I was a teenager, I was notorious for procrastination, but managed to set up a bet with my sister that I couldn&#8217;t finish my homework. 
Obviously, I won. 
Sorry, Simone.
</p>
<p>
  When I had to write my MA dissertation, I stalled long enough on the actual writing part that I ended up betting my parents I&#8217;d have a full draft on New Year&#8217;s Day &#8212; starting from nothing on 28th December. 
I did it, too: my parents had to buy me a pair of giraffe pyjamas and a Jellycat plush for my collection, as I recall&#8230;
</p>
<p>
  When it came to my BSc and now my MSc, I had
  <em>
    Beeminder
  </em>
  .
</p>
<p>
  When I first tried to write this post, I tried to talk about every single Beeminder goal I ever found helpful for studying. 
That got really long, but it did help me pick out the one central thing that helped in every single case:
  <em>
    having to put in the time
  </em>
  .
</p>
<p>
  So if you just want the key takeaway of this post, then my pithy one-line advice is to make a goal tracking your overall time spent studying.
</p>
<h2>
  But how do I decide how much time to spend?
</h2>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;Make a goal tracking your overall time spent studying&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  This is the tricky part! 
Or sometimes less tricky:
in many courses I&#8217;ve done, there&#8217;s an estimate given of how much time they
  <em>
    think
  </em>
  you should be putting in. 
After extensive testing, I can reveal that they&#8217;re usually right &#8212; yes, even if you read incredibly fast (I do) or already know the subject to some extent. 
And it&#8217;s not like there&#8217;s a point beyond which putting in
  <em>
    more
  </em>
  time on a subject is useless.
</p>
<p>
  So here&#8217;s an example about how I set up a goal. 
In October 2020, I logged into my brand-new study environment to discover that the MSc programme I&#8217;d signed up for was very very much self-paced. 
We had two set dates: the first assignment, and the second assignment. 
We were also advised that we should spend about 150 hours on the class, in total. 
The rest was up to us.
</p>
<p>
  The first thing I focused on was that 150 hours: 
I could extract a pace from that, obviously, by setting the end date to the submission date for the second assignment. 
Then Beeminder would tell me how many hours I had to put in per day to reach that goal. 
Simple!
</p>
<p>
  <img
    class=\\"aligncenter\\"
    alt=\\"Nicky's biology graph\\"
    src=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/shanaqui/lshtm_biology.png\\"

</p>
<p>
  <img
    class=\\"aligncenter\\"
    alt=\\"Nicky's biostats graph\\"
    src=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/shanaqui/lshtm_biostatistics.png\\"
  >
</p>
<p>
  It&#8217;s easy to coast by and tell yourself that reading through things once is enough &#8212; but with 150 hours to fill, that was plenty of encouragement to do optional reading, dive deep, make extra notes, etc.
</p>
<p>
  In the end, you can see from those graphs that I didn&#8217;t hit 150 hours, and did make adjustments along the way according to other commitments and re-evaluating how much time I needed to spend. 
I think that&#8217;s fine &#8212; the important thing is that right from the beginning I set out to put a huge chunk of time into the goals, and it paid off. 
(My GPA from the statistics class was a perfect 5, while my GPA from the biology class was 4.5 &#8212; both of those are easily a distinction in my university&#8217;s grading system. 
Thanks, Beeminder!)
</p>
<h2>
  Are there any other goal types you&#8217;d recommend?
</h2>
<p>
  It really depends on how your course is set up, but I think there&#8217;s always room for some supplementary goals that help you
  <em>
    focus
  </em>
  your studying. 
It doesn&#8217;t matter how long you spend on it if you aren&#8217;t finishing your assignments in time, or if you really can&#8217;t remember what medium to culture
  <em>
    Candida albicans
  </em>
  on, after all! 
(Sabouraud dextrose agar, if you were wondering.)
</p>
<p>
  So when it comes to supplementary goals, I have two main suggestions that worked for me: 
flashcards and what I guess I&#8217;ll call progress evaluation, to give it a concept handle.
</p>
<h4>
  Flashcards:
</h4>
<p>
  When it comes to flashcards, I had one goal for making cards, and two for reviewing them (one per class):
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/shanaqui/ankicreate\\">
      beeminder.com/shanaqui/ankicreate
    </a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/shanaqui/bio101reviews\\">
      beeminder.com/shanaqui/bio101reviews

  </li>
  <li>
    <a href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/shanaqui/biostatreviews\\">
      beeminder.com/shanaqui/biostatreviews
    </a>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  There is an unofficial Anki extension out there which pairs with Beeminder, so I could have automated this, but I preferred the dead simple method of adding a +1 when I&#8217;d reviewed all the cards that were due that day.
</p>
<h4>
  Progress evaluation:
</h4>
<p>
  A user in support actually gave me the idea for this goal, saying that they had created a graph and then added &#8220;0&#8221; datapoints (as in datapoints with values of zero) to it in advance, as a kind of guideline. 
I set up a goal to finish two days before my exam, counted up the number of chunks my course was divided into, and made the end total that number. 
Then I got to planning out and tweaking my schedule for actually studying: 
I added zero-datapoints with the headings of each section to the graph, and then figured out how to arrange the dates so it was neatly spread out over time.
</p>
<p>
  The zero-datapoints helped me see well in advance when my data would intersect the line (handy if you&#8217;re like me and you like to have plenty of buffer), the pre-entered datapoints (with explanatory comments like &#8220;Validity and reliability of screening and diagnostic tests&#8221;) acted as a nice checklist for making sure I got everything done, and there was something very satisfying about turning those zero datapoints into something solid and real. 
You can

    title=\\"Spoiler: I got it all done!\\"
  >
    check out the end result
  </a>
  , 
but it probably makes more sense with a quick mock-up of how it looked when I was just getting started:
</p>
<p>
  <img
    class=\\"aligncenter\\"
    alt=\\"Fresh start graph\\"
    src=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/nicky-zero.png\\"
  >
</p>
<h2>
  The bottom line
</h2>
<p>
  For me, a simple do-more goal linked with
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/toggl\\"
    title=\\"Blog post introducing Beeminder&#39;s Toggl integration\\"
  >
    Toggl
  </a>
  is the starting point from which I build, every single time. 
I wouldn&#8217;t say you don&#8217;t need anything else, because you can bet I&#8217;ll be breaking out the flashcards goal again in a couple of months. 
But any other kind of goal has a risk of making you feel like you&#8217;re being really diligent when you&#8217;re just doing the bare minimum. 
There&#8217;s no escaping from simply having to put. in. the. time.

  <a
    href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/premium\\"
    title=\\"You know you want some\\"
  >
    premium subscribers
  </a>
  mostly get looked at first. 
Then we quickly hit some of the simpler requests and derailment-undoings.
Finally, we reply to or flag for other folks any more complicated, time-consuming emails.
Every email gets looked at by at least one person within 24 hours, and 98% of those get a reply in the same window.
For now, 3-7PM (US pacific) is the best time to send an email and get a quick reply&#8230; usually.
Most of the emails fall into the following buckets, and we will reply in the following ways:
</p>
<h3>
  1. I derailed and it wasn&#8217;t legit because I forgot to enter data / my data didn&#8217;t sync!
</h3>
<p>
  No big deal!
Just reply to that legitimacy check email for each derailment and let us know.
If you weaselproofed the goal, we&#8217;ll be more strict about excuses, as described in the weaselproof option.
The rest of the time, we&#8217;ll open up your goal, cancel any pending charge, and reset the pledge level if necessary.
If you&#8217;ve already entered/synced the data you forgot, WE LOVE YOU.
If not, we&#8217;ll email you back asking you to add that data.
We&#8217;ll probably adjust the yellow brick road as well.
(If you&#8217;ve already entered data, the road will be put back to how it was pre-derailment.
If you haven&#8217;t, the flat spot from the derailment may be shortened, so that you don&#8217;t get a free week off.
We&#8217;re watching you!)
</p>
<p>
  If you don&#8217;t send and/or we don&#8217;t reply to this email within 24hours of the derailment occurring, the charge will be processed automatically.
In that case, we have to issue a refund, which we do
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/meta/refunds\\"
    title=\\"Since it&#39;s just us chickens here in the hovertext I guess we&#39;ll admit that refunds are no fun for anyone\\"
  >
    all the time
  </a>
  !
</p>
<h3>
  2. I derailed and it wasn&#8217;t legit because I&#8217;m sick / my flight got delayed for 36 hours / my phone fell into the ocean so I never saw reminders!
</h3>
<p>
  Okay!
We&#8217;ll cancel the charge and leave you a break on the goal to account for your illness / delay / time to buy a new phone.
If something comes up, you can also preemptively email us
  <em>
    before
  </em>
  your goal derails.
Just let us know your Beeminder username and what goal(s) need to be adjusted.
This increases the odds we don&#8217;t miss that 24-hour window.
</p>
<h3>
  3. I derailed on 10 of my goals last week and it wasn&#8217;t legit because I&#8217;m on vacation!
</h3>
<p>
  All righty!
In this case, it&#8217;s
  <em>
    super
  </em>
  helpful for us if you can reply to each of the legitimacy check emails that need to be undone.
Since the derailments occurred last week, we&#8217;ll have to refund, so we go do that.
We&#8217;ll also recommend that you make use of that take-a-break feature next time&#8230; it&#8217;s quite handy!
Again, if you can let us know before they derail, that&#8217;s really helpful and awesome.
But it&#8217;s totally fine if you forget due to extreme beach relaxation vibes.
</p>
<h3>
  4. I&#8217;m flying to Europe in 2 hours and I forgot to put breaks on all my goals!
</h3>
<p>
  No problem!
We&#8217;ll put them in for you so you won&#8217;t derail while you&#8217;re gone.
Enjoy your trip!
</p>
<h3>
  5. I derailed and it wasn&#8217;t legit because Beeminder is broken / I am so incredibly confused!
</h3>
<p>
  Oh no!
We&#8217;ll cancel the charge and reset the pledge, since those derailments are definitely not legit.
Then we&#8217;ll try to get more information from you on what seems broken/confusing, so we can fix it or explain it.
Anything that seems like a Beeminder bug will get flagged for Bee to investigate and/or fix in her daily review.
</p>
<p>
  Sometimes these are known but unfixed bugs or common confusions that could be explained better on the site.
In those cases we will feel great shame and resolve to do better.
(For real, it&#8217;s hugely helpful for us to hear about these issues, even if you think it&#8217;s just your own confusion.)
</p>
<h3>
  6. Can you delete my account?
</h3>
<p>
  Sure thing!
We&#8217;ll ask you to confirm one final time, and once you do so, we&#8217;ll delete the account.
(This is also available in your account settings, as long as you have no active goals.)
</p>
<h3>
  7. Beehavior X is happening on my goal, but I want Beehavior Y to happen instead!
</h3>
<p>
  Thanks for letting us know this isn&#8217;t super clear on the site!
If Y is possible, we&#8217;ll fix your goal and let you know how to do it yourself in the future.
Sometimes Y isn&#8217;t possible, and we&#8217;ll explain why and maybe offer up some workarounds to achieve something similar.
</p>
<h3>
  8. I&#8217;m new and I&#8217;m trying to set up a goal for Beehavior Z, but I have no idea how!
</h3>
<p>
  Ooh, good to know what&#8217;s still confusing for newbees!
We&#8217;ll explain how Beehavior Z best matches up to a Beeminder goal/setting.
We may also point you to
  <a
    href=\\"http://forum.beeminder.com\\"
    title=\\"The Beeminder community is seriously amazing\\"
  >
    the forum
  </a>
  for additional input if it&#8217;s more of a philosophical question than a technical question.
</p>
<h3>
  9. It would be great if Beeminder could do Beehavior M and had Feature N!
</h3>
<p>
  Thanks for the ideas!
Sometimes these are things we&#8217;ve heard a million times and want to do, but can&#8217;t or are intentionally not doing
  <em>
    right now.
  </em>
  (Like integrate with MyFitnessPal.)
Sometimes these are brand new things that we can do in 15 minutes, and do.
(Like adding Romanian to the Duolingo language options, which happened this week!)
We&#8217;ll let you know if the feature already does exist, or its likelihood of occurring, or maybe some ideas for workarounds or hacks to get to the same outcome more quickly.
</p>
<p>
  And don&#8217;t be shy about suggesting things we&#8217;ve probably heard already.
Repetition sends a strong message about how to prioritize.
</p>
<p>
  (Sometimes when I see other companies say things like &#8220;it&#8217;s on the roadmap&#8221; it seems so obvious that they&#8217;re blowing it off.
But weekends off didn&#8217;t exist in Beeminder for years, while literally

So just ask.
Persistently.)
</p>
<h3>
  10.
  <em>
    insert unnecessarily aggressive refund request after never having contacted us before
  </em>
</h3>
<p>
  We&#8217;ll refund the charges and close your account, if requested.
If you ask nicely, we&#8217;ll probably do it a few minutes faster.
It&#8217;s a bummer to deal with bummer emails.

  The feature itself is pretty self-explanatory:
In the Settings for a goal you can add supporters &#8212; friends, family, enemies &#8212; who will get cc&#8217;d on your legit check emails if you derail.
It&#8217;s a bit like

StickK&#39;s version of this feature has been central to their product from the beginning. They&#39;re much more focused on the contract and on verification. Beeminder is focused on the data and the graphs and on the ongoing process and less about actually reaching goals and being finished. That&#39;s why it&#39;s hard for us to quote success/failure rates like StickK does. Most Beeminder goals are open-ended.\\"

  One reason we were worried about shouting this from the mountaintops until now is that we hadn&#8217;t implemented opt-in from the supporters.
We just warned/begged you to let these poor people know what was up so they wouldn&#8217;t spambox us the first time they were CC&#8217;d on one of these derailment emails.
Now we send something like this to someone when you add them as a supporter:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    <strong>
      Subject: someone wants you to help (bee)mind them
    </strong>

      http://beeminder.com/example
    </a>
    &#8212; put down your email address as a person they want keeping an extra eye on them.
You should ask that person what this is all about, and opt in to this by hitting this link: [confirmation link here]
    <br>
    If
    <em>

    also provided inspiration when, during NaNoWriMo, he put a call out on Facebook that if he derailed he&#8217;d pay $50 to the person who had kicked him in the pants the most, where that was defined as bugging him when his Beeminder graph was in the red.

We&#8217;d go so far as to say it&#8217;s those pooh-poohing New Year&#8217;s resolutions 
(including our

    Beeminder&#8217;s New Year&#8217;s Resolution Survivor
  </a>
  .
Let&#8217;s see who among us can keep our resolutions the longest, and who will remain standing as the clock strikes midnight at competition&#8217;s end.
</p>
<h3>
  The challenge
</h3>
<p>
  Pick a resolution and keep your Beeminder goal for it on track all year long.
</p>
<h3>
  Instructions
</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    Set up a goal so that it runs through all of 2019 (or longer!)
  </li>
  <li>
    <a
      href=\\"mailto:support@beeminder.com\\"
      title=\\"Also the Beeminder support address\\"
    >
      Send us an email
    </a>
    with the subject &#8220;Survivor&#8221; and a link to your goal before midnight New Year&#8217;s eve
  </li>
  <li>
    Stay on track!
  </li>
  <li>
    Win!
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  The main rule for the contest, in contrast to how Beeminder normally works, is that you can&#8217;t make your goal easier throughout 2019.
I mean, Beeminder will let you, but you&#8217;re off the island if you do that.
Making the goal harder is always allowed, though, so start conservatively!
Just be ambitious enough that you want to show your goal off.
Because joining the challenge means your goal will be shown publicly at
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/group/NY2019\\"
    title=\\"Gallery of surviving graphs\\"
  >
    beeminder.com/survivor
  </a>
  (for as long as you survive).
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;Duck! Here comes another year!&#8221; &#8212;Ogden Nash
</h4>
<p>
  And what happens if you derail?
Well, the ultimate survivors are the ones who don&#8217;t ever do that.
That&#8217;s the point of the contest, even though in general in Beeminder derailing is not failing.
And even in the contest, all is not lost if you derail &#8212; you&#8217;ll end up below the fold in the gallery of survivors and get a lesser prize.
But derailing twice at the same pledge level means you&#8217;re off the island altogether.
</p>
<p>
  Have other questions before you dive in?
We have answers!
</p>
<h4 id=\\"FAQ\\">
  What if I archive or otherwise quit the goal?
</h4>
<p>
  You&#8217;re off the island!
And, again, same if you make the goal easier.
And, partially, if you ever derail.
</p>
<h4>
  Can I submit more than one goal?
</h4>
<p>
  Sure!
</p>
<h4>
  Can I enter with a goal that has a $0 pledge?
</h4>
<p>
  Absolutely!
</p>
<h4>
  Do I need a new goal or can I use an existing one?
</h4>
<p>
  Either is fine!
As long as it runs at least until the end of December 31st, 2019.
</p>
<h4>
  Do I have to be a premium user to participate?
</h4>
<p>
  Nope. It&#8217;s open to everyone.
</p>
<h4>
  What happens if I just cheat?
</h4>
<p>
  Nothing; you will get to enjoy your hollow, hollow victory.
</p>
<h4>
  What if someone else cheats?
</h4>
<p>
  Other people cheating to win won&#8217;t diminish your victory, since everyone still standing at the end will be a winner. 
It&#8217;s not a zero-sum competition, so you don&#8217;t have to worry about other people cheating.
</p>
<h4>
  What do we win?
</h4>
<p>
  You mean the thrill of victory isn&#8217;t enough?! 
We&#8217;ve got a few treats in mind for the winners, but we don&#8217;t want to make that the central focus or the main motivator for joining.
So we&#8217;re going to save telling you about that for around the mid-point of the competition, when an extra boost of motivation might come in handy. 
There will be physical prizes, though, and some of those prizes will be uniquely available through this competition, so staying on track this year will be the only way to ever get one of those!
</p>
<p>
  UPDATE: Adding new questions that come in&#8230;
</p>
<h4>
  Are scheduled breaks allowed?
</h4>
<p>
  Yes, but only if you schedule them before the clock strikes midnight at the end of 2018!
</p>
<h4>
  Do I need to set &#8220;no mercy&#8221; derails?
</h4>
<p>
  No, just don&#8217;t set the derail behavior any more lenient than the default of 7 days of safety buffer when you derail.
</p>
<h4>
  Can my goal be private?
</h4>
<p>
  No, that makes it too hard to trash talk each other I mean

  We mean literal birds this time, because the Beeminder meetup is going to be 
at Chapman school on the evening of Saturday, September 22 from 6pm to 8pm,
when a massive swarm of swifts fly into the enormous chimney of a school building.
It&#8217;s a weird
  <a
    href=\\"https://audubonportland.org/local-birding/swiftwatch\\"
    title=\\"Swifts!\\"
  >
    Portland thing
  </a>
  , ok?
Also it&#8217;s walking distance (sort of &#8212; a 29 minute walk) from the Quantified Self conference.
Also there will be picnicking.
</p>
<p>
  (To be clear, we mean literal birds and figurative bees &#8212; well, one literal Bee aka Bethany &#8212; and definitely not metaphorical birds-and-bees.)
</p>
<p>
  Backing up, let us tell you about our excuse for doing this, namely the global
  <a
    href=\\"http://qs18.quantifiedself.com/\\"
    title=\\"#qs18\\"

    Quantified Self conference

  which happens to be in Portland this year.

<p>
  But the meetup isn&#8217;t part of the conference.
If you&#8217;re into Beeminder you should come even if you don&#8217;t care about Quantified Self (if that&#8217;s possible).
And vice versa, if you&#8217;re attending Quantified Self and have the merest curiosity about Beeminder, by all means come hang out with us!

  For anyone who is attending the QS conference, or still on the fence somehow, here&#8217;s what&#8217;s most Beminder-relevant or just what we&#8217;re most excited about (see the

  We&#8217;ve been collecting a list of synonyms for the crazy lifehack that

    title=\\"Our evergreen list of all our competitors we know of\\"
  >
    sites like Beeminder

  facilitate.
In addition to us being shameless SEO-whores, it seems like this list could be genuinely useful for humans, especially the kind of humans who read the Beeminder Blog.
</p>
<p>
  Here&#8217;s how a co-founder of
  <a
    href=\\"http://stickk.com\\"
    title=\\"Tagline: Put a contract out on yourself\\"
  >
    StickK
  </a>
  defines, with admirable rigor, exactly what that lifehack consists of:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Entering into an arrangement which restricts one&#8217;s future choice set by making certain choices more expensive, perhaps infinitely expensive, while also satisfying two conditions:
(a) one would, on the margin, pay something in the present to make those choices more expensive, even if one received no other benefit for the payment; and
(b) the arrangement does not have a strategic purpose with respect to others.
  </p>
</blockquote>

I would paraphrase it as: 
voluntarily imposing penalties on your future self purely because you know yourself to be an impetuous fiend who will otherwise act against what your cool-headed current self knows to be your best interests.

    latest Sources &amp; Methods podcast
  </a>
  .
One of many things we talk about in that episode is Dilbert creator Scott Adams&#8217;s claim that goals are for losers.
We&#8217;ve decided that our response to that needs to be its own blog post.
</p>
<p>
  So, for those just tuning in, here&#8217;s our response: 
Adams is absolutely correct.
Goals are the worst.
</p>
<p>
  What you want is systems for ever-increasing awesomeness.
That&#8217;s what the most successful people use, at least the ones Adams knows.
By &#8220;system&#8221; Adams means &#8220;something you do on a regular basis that increases your odds of happiness in the long run.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
  In fact, let me quote Adams at length to nail down the differences between systems and goals:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    If you do something every day, it&#8217;s a system. 
If you&#8217;re waiting to achieve it someday in the future, it&#8217;s a goal. 
[&#8230;]
Goal-oriented people exist in a state of continuous presuccess failure at best, and permanent failure at worst if things never work out. 
Systems people succeed every time they apply their systems, in the sense that they did what they intended to do. 
The goals people are fighting the feeling of discouragement at each turn. 
The systems people are feeling good everytime they apply their system. 
That&#8217;s a big difference in terms of maintaining your personal energy in the right direction.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>
  Don&#8217;t you rave about &#8220;goals&#8221; 1700 times all over Beeminder?
</h3>
<p>
  Yes, but this is a mere terminology problem.
Beeminder is the very embodiment of systems over goals.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;Beeminder is the very embodiment of systems over goals&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  If we want to salvage the term, we can clarify that we&#8217;re talking about
  <em>
    <a
      href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/smart\\"
      title=\\"Beeminder blog post about how Beeminder goals are Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time-bound (and are Evaluated and Re-evaluated)\\"
    >
      S.M.A.R.T.(E.R.) goals
    </a>
  </em>
  , 
which are quite immune to Adams&#8217;s criticism.
I often refer to Beeminder
  <em>
    graphs
  </em>
  rather than Beeminder
  <em>
    goals
  </em>
  , to emphasize the data-oriented process of continuous progress, rather than an eventual end state.
</p>
<p>
  The classic example of weight loss drives home the distinction.
Better than a goal of losing 10 pounds is to have systems for living healthier.
In fact, most Beeminder goals don&#8217;t have success criteria.
They&#8217;re things like 
&#8220;work out at least 3 times a week, forever&#8221; or
&#8220;spend an hour a day writing, forever&#8221; or
&#8220;keep my weight below 100 kilograms, forever&#8221;.

<h2>
  To-Doing Things Is Hard
</h2>
<p>
  As a writer, I find that I sometimes get into
  <em>
    slumps
  </em>
  where I don&#8217;t write anything. 
There will be eighty different half-finished pieces in my drafts.
I&#8217;ll have a late-night epiphany while trying to go to sleep  or in the middle of a shower   about what would make a good post. 
But then I never write the posts.
Eventually, those supposedly great ideas just disappear, and I grow old and whither away and die, and never publish anything.
The end.
</p>
<p>
  Why does this happen? 
Why don&#8217;t we work on the things we 1) find important or 2) enjoy doing? 
The answer is usually not a simple one.
Life is busy, a high-strung juggling-act of responsibilities.
One of the most difficult pills to swallow is that when we put our dreams on the backburner, they usually end up staying there forever. 
Pretty heavy, right? But it&#8217;s true.
</p>
<p>
  But if we don&#8217;t want to put dreams on the backburner, there&#8217;s a need to integrate what we really want to do into daily life. 
It sounds cheesy, I know, and also difficult. 
But while it&#8217;s not an easy task, it&#8217;s also not an impossible one.
</p>
<p>
  Ever since I picked up a self-help paperback at a garage sale when I was eight years old, I&#8217;ve been a self-improvement junkie.
I&#8217;ve realized the dire need to plan out our lives, to find the wiggle room, no matter how small.
Most plans start with a to-do list.
</p>
<p>
  There’s nothing more satisfying than creating an organized, hierarchical to-do list. 
I’ve tried many different productivity programs  &#8212; Todoist, Trello, Omnifocus, etc. 
Even analogue methods, such as bullet journaling and dash/plus. 
However, once I finally finish writing up everything that I need to do, the motivation to actually start going through everything dissolves.
Project management should never be a project itself.
</p>
<h3>
  Four Reasons Why To-do Lists are Fundamentally Flawed:
</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>
      Lack of sense of accomplishment.
    </strong>
    What&#8217;s the pay-off for completing things that were difficult to do? 
Nothing, other than the reward being the journey getting there, which is lame.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      Lack of urgency.
    </strong>
    Nothing is pushing you towards your goals. 
The worst thing that happens is the background color of your overdue tasks turns a shade of dark red, which just makes you feel guilty.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      Lack of visual progression.
    </strong>
    Each day or week, you start up a new list, a bunch of new things that need to be done. 
Your old and completed list usually ends up deleted or in the garbage.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      Lack of automation.
    </strong>
    Each day you have to go over what needs to be done. 
Sure, you can repeat tasks, but that just depressingly fills your calendar up with the same exact schedule over and over.
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>
  And Now For Something Completely To-Different (Hint: It’s Beeminder)
</h2>
<p>
  What can replace a to-do list?
That&#8217;s the million-dollar question.
Never in my life did I think I’d be advocating for a specific productivity tool. 
Personal willpower and discipline always seemed more vital and important to have, rather than any particular software. 
I&#8217;ve always been skeptical and cynical that there was any shortcut to producing good work without working hard.
I&#8217;ve thought that each new trend was just the same wine in a different bottle.
</p>
<p>
  But Beeminder isn&#8217;t a shortcut, and doesn&#8217;t try to pretend that it is. 
You still have to work hard. 
But Beeminder does help in a unique and powerful way.
</p>
<h3>
  What Makes Beeminder Better?
</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>
      Sense of Accomplishment.
    </strong>
    Every step you take is tracked in a visually attractive and auto-generating graph. 
You can see when you&#8217;ve been working hard and when you&#8217;ve been slacking.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      Serious Repercussions.
    </strong>
    Didn&#8217;t get done what you committed to getting done? 
You pay money as a consequence, simple as that.

      <strong>
        Systems Not Goals.
      </strong>
    </a>
    Beeminder takes in what work you do daily (or weekly).
It doesn&#8217;t let you just dream about big, lofty goals. 
You have to constantly be making progress towards them.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      Automation.
    </strong>
    You don&#8217;t have to go about manually writing out what you need done each day, or have your calendar filled with arbitrary tasks. 
Just have a look at your Beeminder dashboard instead.
  </li>
</ol>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;With Beeminder, each success is added on top of the previous&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  There’s something about looking at this kind of progress that’s so much more motivating than a series of crossed-out and completed tasks. 
With Beeminder, each success is added on top of the previous.
You can see the accumulation of your progress and stockpile your victories. 
These graphs include helpful statistics and science as well, such as variance between data points, delta values, and the Akrasia horizon.
</p>
<p>
  It also bombards you with reminders via email, SMS, and even Slack when you’re coming close to failing to maintain progress. 
I’ve found it a lot easier to just do the work I&#8217;ve assigned myself as opposed to have it constantly nag at me, or try to find a way to weasel out.
</p>
<p>
  The most important part, though, is that Beeminder forces you to work gradually  and  linearly. 
This is in contrast to impulsively doing a bunch of work at once, which is what I usually did instead. 
You take the middle path and find balance, while also having the ability to slowly push yourself as time goes on. 
This allows you to create good work consistently without burning out.
</p>
<h2>
  Beeminder in Four Steps
</h2>
<p>
  Now, as great and enticing as this might sound, it still might be a bit confusing. 
I&#8217;ve tried using Beeminder for the past two years and realized there&#8217;s a bit of a learning curve.
Before you actually start using it for multiple goals regularly, you have to think about your big-picture Goals and how to turn them into Beeminder goals.
And it&#8217;s best to ramp up slowly, rather than trying to change everything at once.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    FIRST
  </strong>
  , figure out what you want to change in your life. 
All goals (and subsequently, tracking) should begin like this. 
A solid purpose is everything.
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    Example 1. I want to write more.
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    Example 2. I want to be more physically active.
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    SECOND
  </strong>
  , figure out
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/whattomind\\"
    title=\\"Picking a metric.\\"
  >
    meaningful quantification
  </a>
  of that qualitative goal.
Don’t let ambiguity allow you to slip  &#8212;  put an exact number on what you want to accomplish.
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    Example 1. I want to write 100,000 words in a year.
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    Example 2. I want to run/walk 500 kilometres in a year.
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    THIRD
  </strong>
  , figure how to convert your qualitative goal into a daily system. 
Those goals above may seem daunting but they’re actually a lot more achievable when you break them down.
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    Example 1. 100,000 words / 365 days ≈ 275 words per day
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    Example 2. 500 km / 365 days ≈ 1,800 steps per day
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    FOURTH
  </strong>
  , figure out how to track this new daily system. 
There are plenty of apps and tools out there for specific metrics, usually with well-established APIs that allow for data to be transferred and charted easily.
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    Example 1. Use
    <a
      href=\\"https://draftin.com\\"
      title=\\"Easy version control and collaboration to improve your writing.\\"
    >
      Draft
    </a>
    to sync daily word count on Beeminder.
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    Example 2. Use a multitude of fitness apps and wearables to sync daily step count on Beeminder.
  </em>
</p>

  Ten Things I&#8217;m Tracking

      Gratitude

I simply write out one thing a day that I’m grateful for, and go through every previous data point to see what I’ve been grateful for in the past. 
A great benefit from having this be manual input is that it doubles as a daily check-in for me to other Beeminder goals.

I’ve been trying to learn French for the past few years on my own, and it’s hard, but practicing a little bit each day has helped my retention far more than just occasional cram sessions.

<h2>
  A Daily System of Seven
</h2>
<p>
  For roughly the past forty days, I have been experimenting with my own habits and routines and gathering the associated data with Beeminder. 
I’ve attempted to diligently track aspects of my life. 
This has been me eating my own dog food, so to speak  &#8212;  living the sort of quasi-motivational life that is feel-good on an abstract level.
</p>
<p>
  Here’s what my current day looks like, following the things I track on Beeminder. 
This is essentially putting the theory into practice, and pen to paper. 
The truth is that, other than programming, these habits don’t take up much of my day at all. 
I actually end up having more time to relax or try something new, because I&#8217;m spending less time worrying about what I think I need to be doing.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Start the day off by writing what I’m grateful for and check on my progress on my current goals.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Take fifteen or twenty minutes to practice my French on Duolingo and TinyCards.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Go on a walk or bike ride through my neighbourhood. 
Photograph anything interesting while out.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Spend an hour or two programming. 
Learn something new, document it well, and then push it onto GitHub.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Don’t waste time mindlessly scrolling through Facebook or Reddit. 
Use screen time sparingly, and do something I actually enjoy when I want to take a break. 
(Watch a documentary, play a video game, etc.)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Take a half hour to write in my journal or draft a blog post.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      At the end of the day, tweet about anything interesting that happened during the day.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>
  The End&#8230;?
</h2>
<p>
  While I&#8217;m really happy with my current system, and it seems pretty stable so far, there are definitely problems that I ran into along the way. 
But I don&#8217;t want to derail the topic of conversation! 
Stay tuned for my next article where I follow up with some Beeminder pitfalls I learned the hard way.
It&#8217;ll also include the most important lessons I&#8217;ve discovered from all of this.

  , 
I talked about Beeminder&#8217;s unique way of thinking about goal-setting and self-accountability. 
I also shared my personal systems and how I keep all of my plates spinning at once.
Now I want to go deeper into the weeds and share more insights on how to use Beeminder.
Specifically, how to ensure you set up the right goals from the start, as well as avoid fizzling out.
</p>
<h3>
  Common Mistakes When Starting Out
</h3>
<p>
  I&#8217;ll start with the major slip-ups I found myself making when I first started beeminding.
These caused me to derail more times than I&#8217;d like to admit.
I realized that it&#8217;s as important to track your mistakes as it is to track your goals.
So I looked for the common elements of my failures, and documented them.
While these insights are about Beeminder, the principles can be helpful when dealing with any sort of goal accountability.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>
        Setting goals that require a fundamental change.
      </strong>
      It can be tempting set goals you want to achieve
      <em>
        in theory
      </em>
      , but which are ultimately unrealistic. 
New habits take a slew of things to get working, most notably time and consistent effort. 
Creating obligation in the form of a Beeminder goal can help with this, but it doesn&#8217;t automatically change the way you behave.
Ultimately
      <em>
        you
      </em>
      still have to do that.
And if the goal is unrealistic you might be setting yourself up for failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      An unrealistic goal might be too ambitious (if you haven&#8217;t run since 1996, don&#8217;t start your new running goal at 25 miles per week!).
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Or it might be something that you feel like you 
&#8220;
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/should/\\"
    title=\\"Don&#39;t just resolve to do things, make them more likely, right now.\\"
  >
    should
  </a>
  &#8221; 
do but lack intrinsic motivation for (maybe you haven&#8217;t run since 1996 because you really hate it).
In that case creating a goal that forces you to run regularly is going to set you up for an antagonistic relationship with Beeminder.
There&#8217;s a very good chance you will continue to hate doing the thing, and now you also hate tracking it, and Beeminder by proxy, for making you do the thing.
</p>
<ol start=\\"2\\">
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>
        Lacking a reason.
      </strong>
      Don&#8217;t dive head-first into a goal without first asking yourself
      <em>
        why
      </em>
      .
What are the benefits to achieving your goal? 
Does the outcome make all the work worth it?
What do you value strongly that would give a goal meaning?
Asking yourself these
      <a
        href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/wantcanwill/\\"
        title=\\"How certain are you that you want to / can / and will do this?\\"
      >
        kinds of questions
      </a>
      will help move you from busybee work to doing things that are more important.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having well-defined principles can give you the discipline to carry out difficult tasks, even if there&#8217;s a lack of motivation.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Think deeply about what would help your community, your company, or your future self.
Making your commitments serious will allow you to take them seriously.
</p>
<ol start=\\"3\\">
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>
        Minding things that are a chore to collect data for.
      </strong>
      Not to get too meta on you, but the routine of tracking our habits is a habit itself. 
Because of this, it&#8217;s easy to fail
      <em>
        every
      </em>
      goal if this new routine itself is difficult.
If data collection becomes a chore, then you&#8217;ll start viewing doing something new as a chore as well.
Thankfully, Beeminder is well aware of this and has many ways to automate data collection, like with integrations with other apps and devices.
The goals I&#8217;m tracking that
      <em>
        do
      </em>
      have manual input take less than a few minutes to fill out each day.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>
        Being inconsistent.
      </strong>
      Routines and habits are founded in consistency.
So, especially when you are getting started and still working on building the habit of tracking itself, it&#8217;s best if you&#8217;re tracking something that happens on a consistent basis.
If there&#8217;s a long gap between occurrences it can be all too easy to neglect the task of tracking.
This doesn&#8217;t mean that what you track has to be something you do daily.
Beeminder is great at
      <a
        href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/chunky/\\"
        title=\\"Minding weekly, monthly, and beyond.\\"
      >
        tracking things that happen less frequently too
      </a>
      .
But until the routine of tracking is well established, pick things that are more frequent and consistent.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>
  What Works: 10 Concepts for Better Goal-Setting
</h3>
<p>
  Starting new habits is hard, and breaking bad habits can require a sting operation, so to speak, on multiple fronts.
While examining common mistakes can be helpful, there are still a lot of other pain points that often come up.
Not just with Beeminder, but goal-setting in general.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;It enables you to know where you&#8217;re currently standing, and when you&#8217;re moving in the right direction.&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  So here are some insights I figured out (the hard way) that have helped me.
These ideas are more about the broader, more abstract nature of discipline.
The biggest take away is the Ancient Greek aphorism,
  <em>
    know thyself
  </em>
  , the basis of any self-quantification.
Tracking won&#8217;t automatically make a positive impact, but it will give you the spatial awareness of your past and possible future.
It enables you to know where you&#8217;re currently standing, and when you&#8217;re moving in the right direction.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>
        Commit to what excites you.
      </strong>
      It&#8217;s psychologically important to have a feeling of free will with your goals.
Make a clear distinction between the work you have to do, and the work you want to do.
If you don’t feel like you’re doing something for just yourself, it’ll feel like another chore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, it&#8217;s about asking yourself the right

</ol>

Don’t commit to anything because other people think you should. 
It’s only you.

      The internet makes it easy to get lost in
      <em>

      </em>
      lifestyle goals.
From writing 750 words a day, or meditating for 30 minutes each morning, to only eating fresh greens (yuck!), and so on. 
But your mileage may vary greatly, and certain goals may or may not be realistic for you &#8212; that&#8217;s for you to discover. 
Start very small and gradually ramp up, and you&#8217;ll find out exactly what works for you!
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>
        Hold yourself accountable.
      </strong>
      This of course is Beeminder&#8217;s whole point, but you can take it further.
I’ve put a public link to my Beeminder account in my Facebook and Twitter bios, so anybody can see my progress towards my goals, or lack thereof. 
I also wrote this article!
Tell your friends about the work you&#8217;re going to put in, not the outcome you expect.
Use public pressure as motivation and a tool for good.

      <strong>
        The first try always sucks.
      </strong>
      Mastery takes a lot of time; nothing you try doing will be that good at first.
The first attempt is never meant to be good, it&#8217;s meant to be an attempt.
Grit your teeth and push through it, and accept the time it&#8217;ll take to achieve what you have envisioned.
I’ve been using Beeminder for almost two years and only now are things falling into place.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>
        Surf on seven.
      </strong>
      Give yourself a seven day buffer for every system/goal you start, it&#8217;ll make getting into the flow easier. 
Having this buffer will help with any goal-related anxiety if there&#8217;s a missed day or a hiccup in progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only that, it also gives you time to figure out wich goals are too difficult or easy.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  You might not be able to make your self-perscribed quota for difficult goals, which can cause deadlines to sneak up on you.
Don&#8217;t let this deter you though, instead just lower the expectation of the goal.
Also ask yourself about what&#8217;s causing this goal to be more difficult than you initially expected.
</p>

        .
      </strong>
      When I first experiemented with Beeminder, I added way too many things, and all my goals derailed.
It was discouraging, but when I restarted, I started only with three things.
They were easy things I was already doing; then I began adding something new once a week. 
If I found something wasn’t working within the first week of tracking it, I’d just delete it.
No big deal.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>
        Look for patterns.
      </strong>
      One of the biggest benefits of self-tracking is being able to look at the data of your performance in the past, both good and bad.
Look for correlations: What usually occurs during bad days or good days?
There&#8217;s always randomness, but there also might be a new connection between your productivity and particular circumstances.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>
        Momentum is everything.
      </strong>
      Neglecting commitments for even just a single day has consequences. 
Tomorrow&#8217;s task list is just as busy as today&#8217;s, which means you&#8217;ll have twice the work to do when you put things off.
Postponed tasks build up quickly, and create momentum in the wrong direction. 
Tend to your bee garden every day to avoid getting overwhelmed, even if it&#8217;s only for a few minutes.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>
  Bonus Tip: No Magic Bullet
</h3>
<p>
  My final tip is that there&#8217;s no cure-all.
Spending time looking for an easy solution, or following whatever trendy advice offers shortcuts, will always be a band-aid approach.
It all boils down to doing a lot of hard work, and figuring out how to be happy about doing that hard work.
</p>
<p>
  When it comes to the
  <em>
    self
  </em>
  , there is no finished product, just many, many revisions.
So just jump into it, and learn to observe what works and what doesn&#8217;t work.
Build on the good, disregard the bad, and don&#8217;t hesitate to recalibrate when necessary.

  Procrastination and the Eisenhower Matrix
</h3>
<p>
  So many tasks, so little time. 
Some demand our attention right this minute, while others seem safe to postpone. 
Completing some will push us toward our goals, while others won&#8217;t matter in the long run.

<p>
  We can visualize these two spectra in what&#8217;s often called an Eisenhower Matrix:

Tasks that create real progress are often unstructured and intimidating. 
There&#8217;s no clear consequence to putting them off, so we neglect them in favor of more rewarding tasks.
</p>
<h3>
  Deadlines with Consequences
</h3>
<p>
  There&#8217;s an easy fix: Deadlines.
</p>
<p>
  Most of us have procrastinated on school assignments due at the end of the semester. 
Such assignments are quadrant two tasks &#8212; important but lacking urgency &#8212; so we put them off as long as we can.
</p>
<p>
  As the deadline approaches, the urgency to complete the assignment increases. 
Finally, we can&#8217;t put it off any longer without our grade suffering, so we complete the assignment.
</p>
<p>
  But we shouldn&#8217;t have to rely on someone else threatening us with a deadline. 
Why not create our own deadlines?
</p>
<p>
  There&#8217;s nothing stopping us from adding our own deadlines to our tasks, and many of us do. 
But they often don&#8217;t work as well. 
External deadlines usually carry consequences &#8212; a damaged grade, a boss&#8217;s displeasure, a fine. 
Self-imposed deadlines rarely have such consequences.
</p>
<h3>
  Beeminder&#8217;s Sting
</h3>
<p>
  Beeminder solves the problem of missing consequences. 
By using Beeminder, you allow Beeminder to take your money if you don&#8217;t meet your commitments.
</p>
<p>
  Beeminder takes your quantifiable goal and creates an enforceable plan for reaching it. 
If you don&#8217;t stay on track, you lose money. 
Beeminder turns quadrant two goals into a series of quadrant one tasks.
</p>
<p>
  This works great for losing weight, training for a marathon, and writing every day. 
If you can make the goal quantifiable and it&#8217;ll take at least a month to finish, it will be a great fit for Beeminder.
</p>
<h3>
  The One-off Task
</h3>
<p>
  But not everything that falls in quadrant two meets these criteria.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Calling your tax preparer.
  </li>
  <li>
    Cleaning out a closet.
  </li>
  <li>
    Submitting your application to university.
  </li>
  <li>
    Doing 3 pomodoros today.
  </li>
  <li>
    Studying for your final exam tomorrow.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  While there
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/mustdo\\"
    title=\\"Ancient Beeminder blog post describing one such way to partially beemind your todo list\\"
  >
    may be ways
  </a>
  to beemind such one-off tasks, it won&#8217;t be natural. 
Beeminder isn&#8217;t built to track your todo list.
</p>
<h3>
  TaskRachet
</h3>
<p>
  TaskRatchet is like Beeminder, but for your todo list. 
Every TaskRatchet task has a deadline and an amount of money you pledge on its completion. 
Fail to finish the task in time, and TaskRatchet takes that money.
</p>
<p>
  It&#8217;s still early days for TaskRatchet. 
It needs polishing. 
It&#8217;s missing features. 
It&#8217;s not very pretty.
</p>
<p>
  But people are already using TaskRatchet to complete their own quadrant two tasks. 
The list of one-off tasks above are real tasks that TaskRatchet users have completed.

<h3>
  Beeminder Integration
</h3>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;Beeminder turns quadrant two goals into a series of quadrant one tasks&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  But one type of procrastination remains. 
TaskRatchet can&#8217;t prevent you from procrastinating on adding tasks to TaskRatchet.
</p>
<p>
  So we&#8217;ve added a new TaskRatchet-to-Beeminder integration. 
The integration will allow you to post a datapoint to Beeminder every time you create a new task. 
You can enable the integration by following the instructions in your TaskRatchet account settings.
</p>
<h3>
  Let&#8217;s Build This Together
</h3>
<p>
  With TaskRatchet&#8217;s help, you can beat procrastination. 
And the feedback we get from our early users will have an outsized impact on the future direction of the tool. 
So join today, and let&#8217;s build this together!

<p>
  Full disclosure: as a Ph.D. student in English, it&#8217;s basically my professional obligation to convince everyone around me to read more books, so you might say I have a bias in recommending them here. 
But I genuinely think this is a broadly-applicable goal-structuring methodology.
</p>
<p>
  I was reflecting on some of my favourite, most successful Beeminder goals over the years, and I realised they all had something in common. 
I revived my rusty Latin for an exam, by making my way through a textbook of exercises. 
I studied for the GRE, by making my way through a textbook of exercises. 
I learned how to code in Python, by making my way through a textbook of exercises. 
Have you picked up on the common thread?
</p>
<p>
  Here&#8217;s a hint, the common thread is
  <em>
    not
  </em>
  the exam: nobody was testing me on Python. 
Okay, I&#8217;ll tell you: it&#8217;s the textbook, with exercises.
</p>
<h3>
  Why I think it works
</h3>
<p>
  Unlike a lot of resources, a textbook written for classroom use will go into a level of depth sufficient for a person to actually learn the material.
Teaching people how to
  <em>
    really use
  </em>
  the information they contain is what textbooks were designed for! 
This is why I&#8217;m using an Arabic textbook instead of Arabic Duolingo: 
the textbook systematically introduces, and then tests on, fundamental concepts. 
It’s not sexy &#8212; but it’s useful.
</p>
<p>
  Moreover, whoever made the textbook has already done the hard part of figuring out how a person should learn whatever it is that you&#8217;re trying to learn. 
(This is where &#8220;a very thorough online class&#8221; could easily substitute for &#8220;a textbook&#8221;.) 
Instead of reinventing the wheel, you can follow a process made by somebody who knows what they&#8217;re talking about.
</p>
<p>
  The downside of a textbook, though, is that it&#8217;s pretty monolithic. 
It&#8217;s intimidating. 
Who just sits down and
  <em>
    reads
  </em>
  a textbook? 
The trick of any big, overwhelming task, of course, is to break it down into bites. 
Taken one chapter at a time, or one exercise at a time, or even one page at a time, you never have to Go Read A Textbook. 
Since you know from the start how long the textbook is, as long as you stay on Beeminder&#8217;s yellow brick road you can even know when you will achieve the much-desired status of Having Read The Textbook.
</p>

</h4>
<p>
  The challenge with self-teaching is that learning stuff is usually
  <em>
    way
  </em>
  less fun than
  <em>
    knowing
  </em>
  stuff. 
When you&#8217;re
  <em>
    learning
  </em>
  something, you&#8217;re likely to feel stupid and frustrated, because you&#8217;re stretching your capabilities. 
A lot of online &#8220;learning&#8221; resources, in my experience, really exist to provide people with the much more pleasant feeling of
  <em>
    knowing
  </em>
  things. 
Duolingo is a ton of fun because it gives its rewards immediately: 
cute graphics, happy sounds, numbers that go steadily up &#8212; it just
  <em>
    feels good
  </em>
  to do even the most trivial Duolingo exercise.

  </a>
  Reading a textbook can be stimulating and satisfying, but its immediate pleasures are limited. 
The real payoff of a textbook is at the end.
</p>
<p>
  A classic akrasia problem, right? 
It&#8217;ll feel way better overall to
  <em>
    have done
  </em>
  the textbook, but you&#8217;d always rather do the textbook&#8230; later.
</p>
<p>
  Beeminder makes the long-term into the immediate. 
Beeminder&#8217;s job is to give you a good reason to do one more boring page of that textbook,
  <em>
    tonight
  </em>
  .
</p>
<h3>
  But what about weaseling?
</h3>
<p>
  Self-paced textbook-reading is the quintessential &#8220;you can cheat really easily, if you never want to accomplish your own dreams&#8221; kind of goal. 
Who is really checking that the exercise you did is &#8220;complete,&#8221; after all?
</p>
<p>
  Well, the future chapters of the textbook are. 
This is the biggest challenge I&#8217;ve faced with my textbook goals. 
I&#8217;ll rush through a section without fully understanding it, and then I can&#8217;t make heads nor tails of the next exercise. 
I suggest writing something in the fine print of your goal about what you will do when this happens.
</p>
<p>
  What I try to do, in these scenarios, is to have the good grace to accept the world as it is, rather than as I would wish it to be. 
And then I delete my previous datapoint, accept that I had not actually completed the exercise on that day, pay my derail charge, and re-do the last chapter. 
Maybe you want to come up with another way to handle this problem &#8212; if the Quantified Self aspect is less important to you, you could just give yourself points for the same chapter multiple times, and increase your total desired chapters accordingly. 
Or you could just work a lot harder before your next datapoint, and do your catching-up invisibly. 
But do plan ahead, and come up with something that will let you keep focused on how much you realistically have completed.
</p>
<h3>
  Picking a textbook
</h3>
<p>
  It’s worth doing some research and asking around before you get started, since you’ll be living with this book for a while. 
You can find promising textbooks by googling what you want to learn, plus the word “syllabus,” to see what textbooks get used in college classes. 
(As an advanced strategy, you could politely contact a professor in the field at a nearby university and ask what textbook they like best.)
</p>
<p>
  Questions to ask of your candidate books:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>
      Does it have homework?
    </strong>
    It
    <em>
      must
    </em>
    have exercises that will make you practice what you learn. 
The closer these assignments are to the real use of the skill you&#8217;re learning, the better. 
(Typing out code in an online system is great &#8212; typing out code that you run on your own computer is even better.)
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      Is it suited to my current skill level?
    </strong>
    The first chapter should be fully comprehensible to you (so you can actually
    <em>
      do
    </em>
    the exercises), but not something you could have taught someone else how to do (so you’re
    <em>
      learning
    </em>
    from it).
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  An easy textbook can be worse than one that’s too hard. 
In my experience, a lot of MOOCs are too easy &#8212; but many universities still have “online courses” where they post videos and assignments from the actual classes they’ve taught, and these are challenging enough to provide good learning experiences. 
(MIT has a lot, and Harvard and Duke &#8212; any university you like, you can probably google “university online courses” and find something.)
</p>
<p>
  &#8220;Knowledge fit&#8221; is the hardest thing to find in a textbook when you&#8217;re outside of the formal system of a school, so word-of-mouth and patience are important here. 
I felt like the heavens had parted and blessings had rained down upon me the day someone recommended
  <em>
    All The Arabic You Never Learned The First Time Around
  </em>
  , which perfectly reflected my exact skill level with Arabic.
</p>
<h3>
  The world is your oyster!
</h3>
<p>
  Textbooks are great for really mastering the grammar of a language. 
That goes for programming languages, too. 
Languages and coding are probably the most common things people want to learn, but you can get creative &#8212; what about following an online course in statistics? 
Or history? 
Why not cook your way through a cookbook?
</p>
<p>
  Anywhere in the world that you can find experts, you can find people who learned what they know. 
Learning things is challenging in the short term, but if you break it into bites and work your way through it, you can reap the rewards of being an expert, too.

  This isn&#8217;t an anti-Duolingo piece &#8212; they actually do a pretty solid job of implementing Rosetta-Stone-style language-from-context learning exercises, with spaced repetition to boot &#8212; but Duolingo has limits. 
I spent a year doing Duolingo French, and then I attended 30% of a college French class, and it was the latter that equipped me to actually read in French, because the latter had very unpleasant exams.

  There&#8217;s an old saying that the only person who ever changes you is your mother because she does two things: she always has a simple message (eat your vegetables, brush your teeth) and she keeps repeating that message over and over.
When we
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/beenamer\\">
    set out with Beeminder
  </a>
  to help people modify their behavior, we explicitly built our BeeBot with that mindset.
By putting your goals constantly in front of you and
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/roadwidth\\">
    bringing your long-term goals close
  </a>
  , we hope to effect real and positive change in your life.
</p>
<p>
  So today we&#8217;re giving you another way to interact with the BeeBot &#8212; through SMS text messages.
</p>
<p>
  We&#8217;re rolling this out slowly (as always, email us if you want to be part of the beta test) but starting today, you can get text reminders for all your graphs and respond with data directly from your phone.
</p>
<p>
  To get started:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Go to My Account and add your phone number.
We&#8217;ll send you a text message to ACTIVATE that number.
Just reply to 70-DID-MY-BEE (703-436-9233) with the word ACTIVATE and you&#8217;ll start getting text reminders at around the same time our email reminders go to you.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      You can respond to that text and enter datapoints using the format
      <em>
        graphname day value
      </em>
      .
For example, this will update your weight graph with a value of 150 on the 20th:
      <tt>
        weight 20 150
      </tt>
      .
The BeeBot will respond with a confirmation message to let you know it understood your data. You can put in multiple points if you put them on separate lines.
You can also include an optional comment in quotes after your number.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If you get tired of being bugged (we understand&#8230;  BeeBot will be sad though) just send STOP to the number and BeeBot will buzz off.
We know it&#8217;s annoying to have to think about that though, so the bot also buzzes off automatically if you stop entering data (with the exception that it will remind you again if you&#8217;re about to drive off your yellow brick road).
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  We hope to make Beeminding yourself as simple and enjoyable as possible and the BeeBot looks forward to buzzing your way!

That means if you would like to stuff yourself silly a week from today, or slack off, or otherwise make your 
bright red line
do the opposite of what it normally does, then now is the time to adjust your commitment dial!
</p>
<p>
  Our apologies to our Canadian users for failing to think to give a similar warning last month.
And our apologies for our east coast users, for whom there&#8217;s only one hour left to flatten their [red lines]!

<p>
  If you didn&#8217;t see this in time, fear not! 
It just means you need to make sure to have a couple safety buffer days built up before the holiday.
</p>
<h2>
  Final Addendum
</h2>
<p>
  It&#8217;s now t minus a week till the Monday after Thanksgiving. 
So now would be a good time to dial your [red lines] back up!

Some of those are major new features, like arbitrary deadlines and new autodata integrations.
We&#8217;ve also tried some big experiments, scientific and otherwise.
And of course plenty of crazy commitment schemes&#8230;
</p>
<h2>
  $810 Pre-commitment Pre-anniversary Month
</h2>
<p>
  Technically our birthday is October 11.
As that date approached we were lamenting that we weren&#8217;t quite ready with some big announcements that we really wanted to be part of our anniversary fanfare.
So we picked a date that was close enough and hard-committed to have all those things announced on the blog by then.
How did we do that?

  Things got more than a little hectic scrambling to make good on all that, but as the (retroactively added) links there attest, we pulled it off

<h2>
  New Autodata Integrations
</h2>
<p>
  Autodata is awesome, especially if you want to beemind All The Things. 
And it&#8217;s a perfect symbiosis. 
People who use Beeminder to sting themselves if they fall off the wagon on their 
Duolingo 
practice are going to keep coming back to Duolingo. 
It&#8217;s win-win!
Plus when we pull the data into Beeminder automatically it&#8217;s less work and harder to weasel. 
So part of our business plan is getting as many services hooked up to Beeminder as possible. 
On the fitness tracker front we added
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/jawbone/\\">
    Jawbone UP
  </a>
  support,
with Epson&#8217;s new Runsense GPS about to be officially announced.
</p>
<p>
  It&#8217;s been a much bigger year for beeminding productivity. 
In fact weight loss goals have dropped from 20% of new goals created in year two to 12% of goals created in year three. 
We&#8217;ve got 7 new productivity integrations, to the 2 fitness ones.
</p>
<p>
  New since last year are

    title=\\"Tasker is like If This Then That for your phone\\"
  >
    Tasker + Beedroid
  </a>
  , 
as well as a Zapier trigger (to be officially announced soon!).
These last three can all serve as glue to make up your own autodata goals.
Zapier has hundreds of apps and services they already integrate with that you can now use to trigger new data in Beeminder. 
Tasker on Android lets you do the same kind of thing except with any event on your phone, and Twitter is kind of in a limbo space in between. 
Maybe you would like to actually beemind tweeting more often, for brand building or marketing purposes or something, but it&#8217;s also possible to use hashtags to track a particular sort of tweet, and use Twitter to beemind a gratitude journal of sorts.
</p>
<p>
  And even more abstract than those last three was our

<h2>
  Moar Sociallier

<p>
  We&#8217;ve experimented with making beeminding more sociable, with

and, most importantly, Alice Monday. 
Alice joined us earlier this year and you&#8217;ve probably talked to her if you&#8217;ve interacted with support as she&#8217;s our official Support Czar. 
She&#8217;s also monstrously clever and in addition to implementing pledge caps, and the HabitRPG integration, among other things, has mounted a fierce campaign against our technical debt. 
Tangentially related, she&#8217;s working on an implementation of

<h2>
  So Many Other Things: Features, Buzz, Mania, Guest Posts!
</h2>
<p>
  We&#8217;ve spent a good deal of time on server infrastructure and technical debt this year (though man do we still have mountains of it), 
and Bee even started a UVI-like goal for making
  <a
    href=\\"https://twitter.com/beeminfra\\"
    title=\\"Danny calls these infrahancements\\"
  >
    improvements to behind-the-scenes stuff
  </a>
  that&#8217;s strictly
  <em>
    not
  </em>
  user-visible.
</p>
<p>
  But we&#8217;ve also made new features in Beeminderland:
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/pledgecaps/\\"
    title=\\"Pre-specify how high you want to allow your pledges to go\\"

and, most exciting,

    arbitrary deadlines
  </a>
  ,
are all things we&#8217;ve blogged about. 
(And mouse over those links for summaries.)
</p>
<p>
  In the web interface we give a limited ability for making changes to the yellow brick road, since you can only change it starting a week from now. 
The
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/api#putgoal\\"
    title=\\"You might need to grep for &#39;roadall&#39;\\"
  >
    Beeminder API
  </a>
  now lets you make arbitrary changes to your yellow brick road, subject only to the constraint that you can&#8217;t make it easier on yourself between today and a week from today. 
This means you can clean up ugly jumps in the road, remove flat spots retroactively to see if you could&#8217;ve maintained a given rate all along, or anything else you can imagine. 
Including, of course, retroratcheting and scheduling breaks, or the oft-requested flat weekends. 
If any of you have ideas for a UI for all this power, we&#8217;d love to discuss (we have our own ideas).
</p>
<p>
  Finally, since we&#8217;re being quite exhaustive in this recap post, here&#8217;s everything else worth reading that we&#8217;ve blogged this last year.

Fortunately holding steady at a bit under $20k/month is sustainable.

  into a pillar of Beeminder was one of our perhaps less well-advised endeavors this year. 
Lifecoaching is a wonderfully complementary product to Beeminder, but the key word is &#8216;complementary&#8217;.
Beeminder is much too young to try to diversify.
We should have heeded the standard startup advice to keep all your eggs in one basket.
Be laser-focused on the one thing you&#8217;re best at.
Distractions are fatal and we feel like we dodged a bullet there.

  Predictions
</h2>
<p>
  So as not to end on a downer note, last year in the comments of our second anniversary post,
  <a
    href=\\"http://www.nickwinter.net/\\"
    title=\\"Self-hacker extraordinaire. We always get a little dreamy-eyed when we talk about Nick. In fact, I think we&#39;ve already mentioned him two other times in this post.\\"
  >
    Nick Winter
  </a>
  asked if we had any predictions for the coming year. 
Predictions are hard (especially about the future), and we sort of side-stepped the question. 
But making public predictions of this sort is also a type of commitment device. 
So after this crazy mad dash to the finish, with our $810 commitment (torture) device, I&#8217;m kind of keen to pre-commit to something
  <em>
    now
  </em>
  for next year!
</p>
<p>
  Here goes! $810 says next year&#8217;s anniversary post will include the following:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    A dramatic improvement to new user experience, along the lines of a new user walkthrough (like HabitRPG does!) or changes to goal creation (with data that backs it up as better)
  </li>
  <li>
    Client-side graphs (panning and zooming and mousing over datapoints!)
  </li>
  <li>
    Revamped reminder and notification settings
  </li>
</ol>

&#8220;Yes, but you said you&#8217;d announce them on the blog,&#8221; you say, pedantically.
Is this footnote not on the blog?
&#8220;Touche,&#8221; you say.

<p>
  (We take commitment contracts super seriously and might&#8217;ve called this too weaselly but the spirit of the original commitment was to launch all these things.
Epson and Zapier are temporarily relegated to this footnote because we&#8217;re coordinating a bunch of marketing buzz with those companies in coming days and weeks when we&#8217;ll make splashier announcements.)

  but
  <a href=\\"http://timecarrot.com\\">
    TimeCarrot.com

  is an interesting idea (albeit rough around the edges) that some of you will be interested in.
Most of you know about
  <a href=\\"http://stickk.com\\">
    StickK.com
  </a>
  , which facilitates commitment contracts on arbitrary goals (but no visualization or automatic daily accountability, like with Beeminder).
You also may have heard of
  <a href=\\"http://rescuetime.com\\">
    RescueTime.com
  </a>
  which automatically tracks your time by recording how long you spend in different applications or web pages.
</p>
<p>
  So TimeCarrot combines those ideas:
You tell it what sites or apps you waste time on and set up a real monetary commitment contract and the rest is on auto-pilot &#8212; you waste too much time and you lose.
I tried it (with just a dollar at stake) for my goal of not wasting too much time on
  <a href=\\"http://news.ycombinator.com\\">

  , and lost.

The idea is to decide a task, do focused work on it for 25 minutes, and then get up and take a 5-minute break. 
Rinse and repeat.

  We call one of these 45-minute pomodoros a
  <em>
    tock
  </em>
  .
</p>
<p>
  Prespecifying a well-defined task to work on during the tock is key. 
I also keep a blank sheet of paper next to me so that if I notice myself distracted I can write down what was distracting me. 
Then I don&#8217;t have to juggle all the other things my brain wants to think about in working memory, and when I&#8217;m done I have a handy list of things to either goof off with for the next 15 minutes, or I have a list of things that are maybe more urgent to be working on.

</p>
<p>
  One of the biggest failure modes with this productivity hack is never getting around to starting the next tock. 
It can also fall apart if you&#8217;re feeling particularly prone to distraction and you keep starting tocks and then waking up 45 minutes later in a puddle of your own drool.
So here are two ideas for making tocking stickier.
</p>
<h3>
  1. Do hourly tocks
</h3>
<p>
  Try to start a tock every hour on the hour all day long. 
You can get ahead, but don&#8217;t let yourself fall behind. 
If you get ahead and build up a buffer you can go do other stuff for a while. 
Try to get 1 tock done for every hour you&#8217;re awake, or race a friend to see who can get more done in one day, or don&#8217;t eat dinner until you&#8217;ve completed 8, or whatever.
Essentially this strategy comes down to: gamify it. 
But don&#8217;t worry, all our other ideas involve money!
</p>
<h3>
  2. Beemind it
</h3>
<p>
  I get really great mileage out of my
  <a
    href=\\"http://www.beeminder.com/b/tock\\"
    title=\\"4/day means I can still complete my work by the end of the day even if I run over a lot. If we had a good solution for weekends off I&#39;d dial it even higher though.\\"

Then when I&#8217;m finished I stop the timer, and it announces my time in the chat room, and automatically enters a datapoint for me. 
My Beeminder road keeps me starting tocks while the social accountability keeps me picking meaningful tasks.

  Since I&#8217;ve got the road dialed in so that every day is a beemergency, this is a big disincentive. 
I&#8217;m also incentivized to work diligently to finish in time and not let the task go over, because if I go over I only get half a point. 
Otherwise I get points in exact proportion to the percentage of the tock I completed, i.e. a 37-minute task is worth 37/45 minutes, or 0.82 tocks.
</p>
<p>
  If that sounds over-complicated, you could certainly just beemind tocks without all the rest.

If she gets distracted during the pomodoro she doesn&#8217;t get to count it, and that&#8217;s incentive enough to stay on task.

  since those -2&#8217;s make the Beeminder graph diverge, in some sense, from measuring the actual tockage.

  A lot of folks use Todoist. 
While Todoist is fantastic for keeping track of your to-dos, if you combine it with Beeminder, you can use it to ensure that you actually cross those things off in a timely manner!
</p>
<p>

  </a>
  )
</p>
<p>
  Up until now users have been able to connect Todoist to their Beeminder accounts through IFTTT, and users have done that 596 times, but today we&#8217;re launching direct Todoist &rarr; Beeminder integration. 
The integration will keep track of any to-do items you&#8217;ve checked off, sorted by project or label.
If you don&#8217;t complete enough items to stay on your yellow brick road, we&#8217;ll charge you money.
</p>
<p>
  Today is our official launch of this new integration, but a few folks have been beta-ing it behind the scenes for us. 
Thus far, it&#8217;s a hit. 
As one Todoist and Beeminder fan said, &#8220;I love it! This is huge!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
  The Todoist integration is a big deal for folks that are already using Todoist, but it&#8217;s also a great jumping off point for creating lists for goals that you found hard to automatically beemind before. 
By combining the magic of Todoist and the force of Beeminder, you can create a list for a specific goal and give yourself extra incentive to complete those tasks!
</p>
<p>
  Examples of things you can beemind using Todoist:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Make a list of all the great places you want to eat in a &#8220;Restaurants list&#8221;, and make it a goal to try one new restaurant every month (or you pay up!)
  </li>
  <li>
    Keep a list of books to read (you can add them to Todoist anytime since it&#8217;s mobile-friendly), and beemind reading one book each month
  </li>
  <li>
    Got a huge project or report to write? Using the Todoist sub-tasks feature, create an outline with sections broken down as sub-tasks, and beemind writing one section each week
  </li>
</ul>

  We have so many opinions about time tracking!
To start, there are three fundamental ways to track your time:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Manually
  </li>
  <li>
    Passively
  </li>
  <li>
    Stochastically
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  For passive tracking, you should install
  <a
    href=\\"http://rescuetime.com\\"
    title=\\"We can personally vouch for RescueTime as a wonderful company and highly recommend it\\"
  >
    RescueTime
  </a>
  (and
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/rescuetime\\"
    title=\\"Blog post from way back in 2012 when we announced our RescueTime integration\\"
  >
    hook it up to Beeminder
  </a>
  of course).
And, being passive, you might as well set that up in addition to whatever other time tracking you do.
It will gather useful data about what apps and websites you spend your time on, without you ever lifting a finger.
We highly recommend it!
</p>
<p>
  Stochastic time tracking is beyond the scope of this blog post but it&#8217;s in between passive and manual and doesn&#8217;t yet exist in a form suitable for non-nerds but if you are a huge nerd you can
  <a
    href=\\"http://messymatters.com/tagtime\\"
    title=\\"TagTime! See also tagtime.com\\"
  >
    read about it on my other blog
  </a>
  .
</p>
<p>
  And that brings us to manual tracking, where it&#8217;s up to you to start and stop a timer for what you&#8217;re working on.
If you&#8217;re billing for your time, for example, you probably need that.
And we now have a definitive recommendation for what you should use:
  <a
    href=\\"http://toggl.com\\"
    title=\\"We may finally be getting used to typing Toggl without accidentally typing an e on the end\\"
  >
    Toggl
  </a>
  !
</p>
<p>
  Toggl was already popular with Beeminder users (and vice versa, we hear) and people would set up
  <a
    href=\\"http://ifthisMINDthat.com\\"
    title=\\"Beeminder&#39;s IFTTT channel -- very fancy stuff here\\"

    title=\\"Beeminder&#39;s Zapier channel -- more fancy stuff here\\"
  >

  </a>
  zaps to send their Toggl data to Beeminder.
But today we&#8217;re officially launching direct Toggl &rarr; Beeminder integration.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;It&#8217;s a slippery slope of sloth&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  Pick any subset of projects, tags, or clients (or just count all Toggl-tracked time) when you create a Toggl-fed goal on Beeminder.
You also choose how many hours per week you want to commit to, and whether to start with some initial safety buffer.
Then just use Toggl like always and Beeminder will automatically plot your cumulative time spent on a fancy graph with a Yellow Brick Road denoting the rate you&#8217;ve committed to.
Keep all your datapoints on or above that yellow brick road and Beeminder will always be free.
If not, we charge you real money.
It&#8217;s very motivating!
</p>
<p>
  The power of Beeminder comes from the fact that you have to stay on track every single day.
(Unless you get ahead and build up safety buffer, but you can never let your average rate fall below what you committed to.)
Maybe you&#8217;re a freelancer and the time you spend working translates pretty directly to serious money.
The (common) problem is that it doesn&#8217;t matter much if you slack off
  <em>
    today
  </em>
  , as long as you get serious tomorrow.
Except tomorrow comes and becomes the new today and the same reasoning applies.
It&#8217;s a slippery slope of sloth!
Beeminder breaks you out of that pattern and gives you an immediate incentive to make incremental progress every day.

<p>
  Working in Beeminder support, it&#8217;s hard to avoid noticing that folks sometimes feel a bit embarrassed about their goals.
Or at least of the fact that
  <em>
    they
  </em>
  need to beemind learning how to juggle goslings when everyone
  <em>
    else
  </em>
  is born knowing how. 
So let me put it right out there: 
my most socially embarrassing goal is probably the one for brushing my teeth in the mornings.
</p>
<p>
  I know, I know, a lot of you are instantly wondering why that would be something that takes effort. 
You roll out of bed, go to the sink, and boom&#8230;
</p>
<p>
  But some of you know what I mean. 
Trauma, ADHD, sensory issues, the awkward fact that putting anything (much less a whole toothbrush head) into the back of your mouth at 6am causes your gag reflex to trigger&#8230; 
Whatever your reason, you&#8217;re not alone. 
And whatever other gosling juggling task you need to beemind, there are other people who struggle the same way. 
And I don&#8217;t think we need to be embarrassed, either!
</p>
<h3>
  Can Beeminder help?
</h3>
<p>
  Yes!
</p>
<p>
  But let me qualify that: it may not be a magic bullet for you. 
I derailed 17 times on my goal for brushing my teeth before I got it kind of figured out. 
So let&#8217;s go on a little journey about that.
</p>
<h3>
  Why don&#8217;t you just do it in the first place?
</h3>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;It tells you something about what the obstacles are&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  I think this is a key question to ask at the beginning of trying to set a new habit.
It tells you something about what the obstacles are. 
If you don&#8217;t exercise because your gym teacher used to shout at you and make you feel terrible then maybe self-criticism or fear of others watching you is going to be what gets in your way. 
Maybe you can mitigate that by choosing an exercise that you can do on your own, or face up to it by signing up for a class or getting a personal trainer.
</p>
<p>
  For me, for instance, one of the obstacles in my way of remembering to brush my teeth was bad dentistry. 
My childhood dentist used to cause me pain and humiliate me constantly, and then &#8220;promised&#8221; me braces (which I&#8217;d seen my best friend suffering with) if I got better at brushing my teeth.
</p>
<p>
  Needless to say, I didn&#8217;t want braces if she wanted to give me braces. 
So to prevent my parents from forcing me into it, I just didn&#8217;t brush my teeth. 
Makes total sense when you think about it, but it doesn&#8217;t serve any purpose
  <em>
    now
  </em>
  .
</p>
<h3>
  Why do you want to change that?
</h3>
<p>
  This is really important too. 
You know what&#8217;s holding you back now, but what&#8217;s pushing you on? 
And I&#8217;d say think of as many things you can here! 
You want to experience a runner&#8217;s high regularly, 
you want to enjoy the outdoors on a more regular basis, 
you want to stick it to the haters, 
you think it&#8217;ll help with your anxiety&#8230;
</p>
<p>
  As I grew up, I realised that the main person being hurt by all this was me. 
Plus I got a new dentist. 
So I started actually wanting the
  <em>
    results
  </em>
  of clean teeth: 
better health in general, 
fewer fillings, 
looking better, 
etc.
</p>
<p>
  I try to remember that when I get frustrated. 
Which I do. 
A lot.
</p>
<h3>
  Alright, so what did you do?
</h3>
<p>
  The first thing I did was use a streak tracker. 
I think it may have been
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/habitica\\"
    title=\\"Guest post on the Beeminder blog about Habitica\\"
  >
    Habitica
  </a>
  , because I didn&#8217;t know about Beeminder yet. 
It worked pretty well, and I managed to learn to brush my teeth every evening on autopilot. 
It&#8217;s the last thing I do before I go to bed.
</p>
<p>
  Brushing my teeth in the morning, though&#8230; 
I&#8217;m not a graceful riser, to put in lightly. 
So that often just slipped in the morning rush. 
And that broke my streak, 
and that broke my motivation, 
and I was stuck again.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;Beeminder never let me give up &#8212; straight back on track, every time I slipped&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  The nice thing about Beeminder is that when you miss the task for one day, it may not even matter if you have buffer built up. 
And if it does matter, and you derail, you&#8217;re put right back on track. 
You get the little sting, and sometimes that&#8217;s enough to keep you from derailing in the first place. 
I&#8217;d argue that the most powerful thing is being put right back on track, though.
</p>
<p>
  I&#8217;ve been working on this goal on Beeminder since September 2018, and Beeminder never let me give up. 
Straight back on track, every time I slipped.
And when you look at the graph, you can also see immediately how often I succeeded. 
That trend is
  <em>
    always
  </em>
  going up!

</a>
<p>
  As you can see on the graph 
(at least at the time of writing), 
I recently had a breakthrough. 
I don&#8217;t know if this secret will work for other people, but after years of failing in setting up a routine, I created a simple two-step routine. 
The first thing I looked at in the morning was a book, and I&#8217;d read for 10 minutes, to start the day off with something chill and enjoyable. 
Then I&#8217;d go brush my teeth.
</p>
<p>
  I&#8217;ve dropped the reading habit for now, but somehow the cue to go brush my teeth remains.
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"RATCHET1\\"
    href=\\"#RATCHET\\"
  >
    [1]
  </a>
  I do strongly recommend creating a routine that&#8217;s robust, though, because I know that the day I&#8217;m most likely to fail is on the weekend when my routine changes. 
I got down brushing my teeth at night because I do it right after changing into my PJs, and that works in the morning on weekdays, but not on Saturdays and Sundays when I get to laze around in my PJs for much longer.
</p>
<p>
  I suspect everyone&#8217;s path to this is different, but stopping to reflect on your reasons for not doing the thing and your motivation to learn to do the thing, and then setting up a Beeminder graph to keep picking you up when you fall&#8230; 
Most likely, you&#8217;ll do better than you did
  <em>
    without
  </em>
  Beeminder.
</p>
<p>
  And if you&#8217;re feeling embarrassed about your goal, please don&#8217;t. 
I can almost guarantee you&#8217;re not alone.

  You may have noticed (if you see this at the time of writing) that I have a lot of buffer built up because I have a rate of less than 1/day, so that when/if I stop brushing my teeth, it&#8217;s going to be a loooong time before I have to do that again. 
For now I&#8217;m celebrating my achievement, and enjoying that buffer number going up.
But in the future I will use a

</p>
<p>
  There&#8217;s a famous philosophy thought experiment about how the concept of forming an intention might not be as coherent as it seems. 
Suppose some magic mind-reading aliens (you know the type) offer you a million dollars to drink a nasty but ultimately harmless toxin. 
Let&#8217;s say it makes you puke your guts out for a week but then you&#8217;ll fully recover. 
And say that that&#8217;s a no-brainer for you &#8212; you&#8217;d absolutely take the deal. 
But the aliens&#8217; actual offer is actually much more attractive:
you get the million dollars just by honestly
  <em>
    intending
  </em>
  to drink the toxin. 
If you do, they pay up and fly away. 
Whether you actually follow through and drink the toxin doesn&#8217;t matter anymore.
</p>
<p>
  Can you get the million dollars now? 
You are predictably going to chicken out on drinking the toxin later, with no money at stake anymore. 
Knowing that, maybe you can&#8217;t form an honest intention to drink it? 
Of course if you employ a commitment device then it&#8217;s trivial, so the thought experiment generally stipulates that those aren&#8217;t allowed.
</p>
<p>
  I think maybe a hardcore rationalist would intend to drink the toxin and then
  <em>
    actually do it
  </em>
  on the grounds that that&#8217;s the only way to retroactively cause the million dollars to have (in the past!) been given to them. 
This is counterintuitive. 
Drinking the toxin is unambiguously idiotic unless you somehow think that doing it can change the past. 
People do bite that bullet.
</p>
<p>
  Or maybe it&#8217;s enough to have very high value for a sense of self-consistency? 
But of course violating that sense of self-consistency is a consequence of sorts. 
Which makes it a little bit like a commitment device?
</p>
<p>
  (Aside: I love how a commitment device dispatches the whole paradox so neatly that the puzzle has to be amended to specifically disallow it.)
</p>
<p>
  As we learned in
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/incentalign\\"
    title=\\"Generalizing the concept of commitment devices\\"
  >
    our blog post on incentive alignment
  </a>
  there isn&#8217;t a bright line definition of a commitment device. 
What if you solemnly promise to your best friend that you&#8217;ll drink the toxin? 
Is that a commitment device or just voicing the intention? 
Breaking a promise has real consequences &#8212; future ones, not just past &#8212; so I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s on the spectrum.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;It establishes a precedent that&#8217;s almost like a superpower&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  What if you choose to drink the toxin because it establishes a precedent that&#8217;s almost like a superpower: 
merely uttering &#8220;I hereby intend to X&#8221; becomes itself a magic commitment device ensuring you actually do X! 
Maybe that&#8217;s worth enduring the toxin for. 
But this again is incentive alignment. 
By intending to drink the toxin in order to establish a superhuman follow-through precedent, you&#8217;ve created real consequences for yourself in the future. 
You&#8217;ve created a genuine incentive for your future self to follow through.
</p>
<p>
  The very act of forming an intention can and should imply future consequences for flaking out.
</p>
<h3>
  What if I just intend to have ice cream after dinner?
</h3>
<p>
  In that case the consequences are built right in.
Ice cream is delicious.
Your incentives are perfectly aligned.
That intention to have ice cream is the same as a prediction that you&#8217;ll be having ice cream.
If you change your mind for any reason &#8212; even due to a random burst of willpower &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t matter.
You still had the honest intention qua prediction that you would have ice cream.
But that obviously doesn&#8217;t work when you replace the ice cream with the toxin!
</p>
<p>
  So, again, if the intention isn&#8217;t already incentive-aligned then it has to involve a commitment in order to be an honest intention.
If the aliens want to get out of paying you your million dollars by calling this conception of intention a commitment device, that means defining away the concept altogether. 
If we&#8217;re talking about pure intention with no consequences then it&#8217;s strictly a prediction of your own future behavior. 
When faced with the choice of drinking the toxin and having zero incentive to do so, of course you won&#8217;t. 
So that&#8217;s your honest prediction. 
Predicting otherwise would be dishonest and so you have no way to get the million dollars.
</p>
<p>
  So that&#8217;s my solution to Kavka&#8217;s toxin puzzle. 
Pure intention stripped of all consequences is nothing more nor less than a prediction of your future behavior. 
The only way to form an honest prediction that future-you will do something you won&#8217;t have incentive to do is to create that incentive.

  &#8220;We automatically track the number of cards in your Done list.&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  Moving a card into the Done list feels pretty awesome.
So in order to feel more awesome more often, we figured we&#8217;d beemind the number of cards in that list!
But it&#8217;s pretty easy to forget to update your Beeminder graph every time you move a card into the Done pile.
For many kinds of goals the Beeminder email bot or
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/textbot/\\">
    SMS bot
  </a>
  solves the forgetfulness problem nicely: just reply to the bot with your number every day.
But that would be annoying for Trello since you&#8217;d have to go and count the number of cards.
</p>
<p>
  Enter the Trello API. We&#8217;ve set up a new goal type that automatically tracks the number of cards you&#8217;ve moved into one (or more) of your Trello lists.
You can
  <a href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/trello\\">
    set one up
  </a>
  just by pasting a link to the Trello board you want to track.
If your board is private, you&#8217;ll be prompted to let Beeminder access your Trello account with the typical OAuth goodness.
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"OAU1\\"
    href=\\"#OAU\\"
  >
    [1]
  </a>
</p>
<p>
  Then just use Trello like you normally do.
Move a card into one of the lists you chose and you&#8217;ll see the data point appear on your graph, usually within 10-15 minutes (we don&#8217;t want to overload Joel&#8217;s servers!). UPDATE: Beeminder fetches your data less often than that now but you now can just hit the refresh button on your graph page if you want it to fetch your latest Trello count Right Now.
</p>
<p>
  I&#8217;ve set up Beeminder goals that are tracking how many cards we finish on our
  <a href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/apb/goals/trello-website\\">
    website board
  </a>
  as well as our

  These Trello boards are all completely open to the public, and we&#8217;ve tried our best to let anyone contribute. 
It seems like Trello requires that you be manually added as a contributor before you can create cards, but if you
  <a href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/contact\\">
    ask us
  </a>
  we&#8217;ll definitely add you. 
And if someone at Trello is reading this, we&#8217;d love a promiscuous mode for boards that lets anyone at all contribute to them!

  I was nearly twice as fast as Danny in the swim &#8212; 1.5 km down the Hudson &#8212; but he took those 15 minutes back out of me on the 40 km bike course.
Danny was hilariously lopsided.
There were only a few people in his division slower than him in the swim (he doesn&#8217;t swim so much as tread water in a vaguely forward direction) and only a handful faster in the bike.
(Full results for Team Beeminder:

  Interestingly, I was only 3 minutes slower than Danny in the 10 km run around Central Park.
Maybe that&#8217;s partly because Danny was entirely balls to the wall in the bike and didn&#8217;t save anything for the run, but mostly it&#8217;s that I actually trained for the run a bit, thanks entirely to Beeminder.
</p>
<p>
  I really hate running and the 10 km run was the most daunting part of the triathlon from my perspective.
In the end my 10 minute/mile pace was not great compared to my division, but it was far better than it would have been otherwise.
I planned way ahead and started a Beeminder goal to train for running

  It was an epic battle and I worked my way up to $90 at risk. 
I felt pretty annoyed at myself for letting the $30 slip by, and at $90 I was damn well going to stay on that road.

  There were a couple epic close calls, including one night a couple weeks before the triathlon when I bolted up in bed at 11:48pm realizing that I had forgotten to do my run that day.
I only had 0.7 miles to do, so it was technically possible, so out of bed I flew, threw on my running shoes which were nearby, and the first piece of clothing at hand (a minidress), and sprinted up the stairs and around the block.
I eked out 1 mile in just under 9 minutes, which was probably a new PR for me at the time.
About a week later I did the same thing, sprinting out of a hack night with friends at about 11pm, in my street clothes, to run a mile in the Pearl before I headed home (with a new PR of 8:41). 
I really needed Beeminder&#8217;s axe hanging over my head even to get the bare minimum done (and sometimes that bare minimum was pretty unambitious).
</p>
<p>
  Ironically, I failed to stay on the road in the end.
I kept doing only the bare minimum and leaving it until the end of the day, and the day we left to head to New York for the triathlon was no exception. 
We had an 11:15pm flight and at about 9:45 I still hadn&#8217;t even packed (because I procrastinate on everything).
By the time I&#8217;d collected water bottles, bike shoes, helmet, tri gear, regular clothing, etc, there was no time left. It is hard to run on a plane.

for our own fitness goals the money goes to Beeminder.
And, yes, I own something approaching half of Beeminder (and am married to much of the other half).
But given credit card processing fees plus other Beeminder stakeholders (like the
  <a href=\\"http://portlandseedfund.com\\">

  ) an annoyingly large part of a $90 pledge is not ending up back in my pocket.

  One of my vices is that I drink a bit too much. 
Not to the level where I have a problem, but it would be strictly better if I cut out about 2 or 3 of the drinks I have in a typical week.
This seems like an obvious use case for Beeminder.
</p>
<p>
  I&#8217;ve previously beeminded units of alcohol consumption and concluded that, measured as a total number of units per week, I&#8217;m completely fine.
The recommended maximum intake for an adult male is somewhere in the region of 20 - 25 units per week depending on who you ask.
When I was beeminding this regularly I never had trouble keeping under 12 units. 
I drink a bit more than that now, but nowhere close to twice as much.
</p>
<p>
  So if I&#8217;m that far under the recommended guideline why do I think I drink too much?
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;Beemind the peaks as well as the averages&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  Well, the low average is because I actually have a lot of nights of any given week where I don&#8217;t drink at all.
The problem is that on nights that I
  <em>
    do
  </em>
  drink I often have a drink or two more than I should. 
I make tasty cocktails, and if I&#8217;ve just had a cocktail I really liked then making another one sounds like an excellent idea.
By the third drink of the evening I will usually discover the next day that it
  <em>
    wasn&#8217;t
  </em>
  such an excellent idea.
</p>
<p>
  So what I need is a Beeminder goal that matches the structure of the behaviour I want to change: 
I need a way to beemind the
  <em>
    peaks
  </em>
  as well as the averages.
A week with two three-drink nights should &#8220;cost&#8221; more than a week with a single drink every night.
</p>
<p>
  I&#8217;ve come up with what seems like a good structure for this.
</p>
<p>
  The idea is to assign each drink
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"UNITS1\\"
    href=\\"#UNITS\\"
  >
    [1]
  </a>
  a number of points.
The first drink in a day costs one point, the second two, the third three, and so on.
Because these add up, this means that a day with one drink costs one point, a day with two drinks costs three, a day with three drinks costs six.
It mounts up pretty quickly.
These running totals are called
  <a
    href=\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_number\\"
    title=\\"Or just look at the title image with the 6 bees and you&#39;ll have the idea\\"
  >
    triangle numbers
  </a>
  , 
hence the title of this post.
</p>
<p>
  To start with I&#8217;ve capped the total number of points at 15/week. 
This is a deliberately lax starting rate which equates to a maximum of 11 drinks in a week (3 days with 1 drink and 4 with 2).
Since the drinks I tend to have are two units this is about at the recommended maximum. 
Note that I can hit the limit while drinking less than that: 
If I have more than two drinks on any night, the extra points mean I&#8217;m forced
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"FREE1\\"
    href=\\"#FREE\\"
  >
    [2]
  </a>
  to reduce the total for the rest of the week to compensate.
</p>
<p>
  Example permitted maximum drinking patterns:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    4 days with 2 drinks and 3 days with 1 (11 drinks)
  </li>
  <li>
    1 day with 3 drinks, 1 day with 2 drinks, 5 with 1 (10 drinks)
  </li>
  <li>
    2 days with 3 drinks, 3 days with 1 drink, 2 days alcohol free (9 drinks)
  </li>
  <li>
    1 day with 4 drinks, 1 day with 2 drinks, 2 days with 1 drink (9 drinks)
  </li>
  <li>
    1 day with 5 drinks (!) and no drinking the rest of the week (5 drinks)
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Note that 3 days with 3 drinks is not permitted even with the remaining rest of the week free: 
That would be 18 points which would take me over the threshold

  got so excited by the concept that he added a feature for it, so it&#8217;s easy to give this a try yourself:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Go to &#8220;Terrifyingly advanced settings&#8221;
  </li>
  <li>
    Convert your goal to a custom goal (this requires a

    ).
  </li>
  <li>
    Switch the aggregation mode to &#8220;Triangle&#8221;
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Best to apply this to a fresh goal. 
This stuff can easily screw up your goal if you&#8217;re not careful, so don&#8217;t do it to one with data you care about.

  If you want to track it manually instead, just enter the numbers yourself: 
1 for the first drink, 2 for the second, and so on

A standard Do Less goal will sum those up, yielding the triangular numbers.
</p>
<p>
  So far this is experimental.
I&#8217;ve only been running this for a few days, so it may turn out to be a silly idea in the long run.
I don&#8217;t think it will though.
I&#8217;m quite pleased with the incentive structure it sets up, and the effect so far has definitely been to make me think more carefully about the later drinks.
I&#8217;ll add a follow up comment to this post in a month or so when I&#8217;ve had time to see how it works.

  Drinks, not units of alcohol. 
I try to keep my Beeminder goals based on things I don&#8217;t need to estimate or measure. 
Especially if I have to estimate them after a few drinks. 
Most of my drinks are approximately two units as I tend to drink cocktails or spirits.

  Well, &#8220;forced&#8221;.
I have this goal set up so that it&#8217;s OK to fail occasionally. 
I&#8217;ve got a pledge cap of $10 set, so the worst case scenario is that my drinks suddenly become a bit more expensive.
This is coupled with a no-mercy recommit: If I decided last night that I was OK derailing, I&#8217;m not off the hook today.
This is based on

  Normally this wouldn&#8217;t be quite true because I could build up buffer from week to week if I wasn&#8217;t drinking much, but I&#8217;ve got this goal set to auto-ratchet so I can&#8217;t actually do that.
If I build up more than a week of buffer it cuts back down to a week.

  Danny again: Actually, QS is more about measuring real-world things.
With the triangle aggregation, we&#8217;ve got the best of both worlds.
We get a true count of the number of drinks (real-world measure)
  <em>
    and
  </em>
  we get a goal-friendly aggregation for beeminding.
You can export the data and do something else with it or change the aggregation function back to normal summing if you want to go back to beeminding total amount of alcohol consumed.

  can be counted on to faithfully and unfailingly report true numbers to your own commitment contracts, but I shouldn&#8217;t be.
Not that I set out to cheat on myself, but it can get awfully hard.
Remember that my lucid self that enters into these contracts isn&#8217;t the same stressed self that has to fulfil them.

    elephant and rider
  </a>
  .
Beeminder is a tool used by the lucid rider to alter the inclinations of our in-the-moment elephant selves.
</p>
<p>
  The problem is this:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Beeminder seeks to find the pledge amount that&#8217;ll keep me on the road to my goal
  </li>
  <li>
    It&#8217;s up to me to report whether I&#8217;m on the road
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  We&#8217;ve entered into a contract where one party has an information advantage.
My stressed self is the one in the know, and might be prone to fiddle the numbers &#8220;just a little&#8221;, &#8220;just this once&#8221; in order to keep my goal on track.
Unfortunately, such

    title=\\"Philip&#39;s original Beeminder blog post on weaseling\\"
  >
    weaseliness
  </a>
  only keeps the pretty graph on track, not the actual goal itself.
</p>
<p>
  So what&#8217;s the solution?
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;A goodly number of Beeminder&#8217;s meta goals are independently verifiable&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  For that, we can look at the people with the worst potential conflicted desires: 
Beeminder founders Daniel Reeves and Bethany Soule.
If you&#8217;ve been following along with Beeminder&#8217;s own
  <a
    href=\\"http://forum.beeminder.com/t/take-the-beeminder-founders-money/799\\"
    title=\\"Forum thread where you can claim the founders&#39; money when they derail on certain meta goals\\"
  >
    meta goals
  </a>
  , 
you&#8217;ll see that a goodly number of them are independently verifiable.
When the founders commit to delivering a User-Visible Improvement every day, the benchmark is that they tweet their progress on
  <a
    href=\\"http://twitter.com/beemuvi\\"
    title=\\"Twitter feed of all 1640 (and counting!) User-Visible Improvements (UVIs)\\"
  >
    @beemuvi
  </a>
  .
In turn, they&#8217;ve got the pressures of pride and reputation to only claim progress that&#8217;s worth announcing.
</p>
<p>
  Consider it the job of your lucid self to set things up so that even your stressed elephant-self thinks it&#8217;ll be easier to just, say, go for a short run, than to fake the data.

</p>
<h2>
  Autodata!
</h2>
<p>
  In the absolute ideal, Beeminder would just notice that you&#8217;ve done the thing and record the data for you.
For example, why should you manually report a new blog post like this one, when you could ask your Beeminder goal to subscribe to the blog feed?
The act of posting would itself increment the counter.

  </a>
  Not everything is as easily observable as a new blog post, but I could tweet or facebook where I am in my latest book, or how many jobs I&#8217;ve applied for, or whatever it is that I&#8217;m counting.
</p>
<p>
  For every activity, there is a natural place to record it.

  If it&#8217;s work hours, then you might keep a timesheet, update your calendar, or use TagTime or some other semi-automated monitor of your activities.
If it&#8217;s your weight, then a Withings scale is just the ticket.
If it&#8217;s running or calorie counting, well,
  <a
    href=\\"http://beeminder.com/runkeeper\\"
    title=\\"Beeminder&#39;s Runkeeper integration\\"
  >
    there are apps for those
  </a>
  too.
</p>
<p>
  If I&#8217;m going to track my run with GPS anyway, why not use that same data source to update Beeminder?
Doing anything else is a duplication of effort and requires me to do the task and also remember to tell Beeminder that I&#8217;ve done it. 
By eliminating the doing-reporting gap, I&#8217;m more likely to make
  <em>
    actual progress
  </em>
  toward my goal.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;Productive Laziness requires us to change the path of least resistance&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  This isn&#8217;t necessarily a lack of trust of my future stressed self, it&#8217;s productive laziness.
In my work I help people build better systems and structures, ways for them to be appropriately and productively lazy.
I want them to keep moving in the right direction even when they don&#8217;t have the energy to think at a meta level, and that requires structural solutions that change the path of least resistance.
</p>
<p>
  That means I can reserve my lucid thinking for when I&#8217;m setting things up, not for everyday activities.
And that matters because my lucid self cares about the actual goal and about a better future, no matter what my right-now self feels.
Beeminder knows that the self that sets the goal is still the same person that sticks to it, that the rider is also the elephant.
Make the most of your divided self when making your graphs.

    Fancying myself as Chief Scientist and Beehaviorial Economist I just wanted to coopt a footnote to chime in &#8212; since I&#8217;ve seen this be contentious &#8212; that 
I agree Multiple Selves is a valuable metaphor but ultimately there&#8217;s one self, whose decision-making is distorted in the face of immediate consequences.
This is the phenomenon of hyperbolic discounting.
You fight it (with Beeminder&#8217;s help) by altering the future immediate consequences you&#8217;ll be faced with.

  , so we predict a lot of you will be into trydeepwork.com.
It brings together a little bit of Toggl, Focusmate, Complice, and Spotify into one simple tool, which, incidentally, we are using right now to draft this post!
It aims to help you do deep work, minimize distractions, and make the most of your time.
It has timers and goals and challenges and analytics and productivity muzak.
</p>
<p>
  But mostly it&#8217;s just this:
You describe a task, start a timer, and get down to work.
</p>
<p>
  If you&#8217;re new to Beeminder, funneled here because of a deep love for deep work, the quick recap is that we&#8217;re quantified self + commitment contracts. 
You set a goal, we graph your progress, and whenever your datapoints cross a bright red line, we take your money. 
We&#8217;re a great antidote to procrastination. 
If there&#8217;s something you want to do, you know you
  <em>
    can
  </em>
  do, and yet historically you don&#8217;t do, then you should beemind it!

<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">

  If it&#8217;s important to you to [exercise / practice an instrument / eat better / you name it] but you find that you never get around to it (a &#8220;
  <a href=\\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/round_tuit\\">
    round tuit
  </a>
  &#8221;, get it?), well, we have an app for that.
Think of Beeminder as your
  <a href=\\"http://beeminder.com\\">
    Round Tuit dispenser
  </a>
  .
The problem is common: not everything that&#8217;s important comes with a built-in deadline or squeaks or whines loud enough.
&#8220;One more day&#8221; of not exercising really won&#8217;t hurt, but it&#8217;s all too easy to slide down a Slippery Slope of Sloth.
&#8220;One more day won&#8217;t matter&#8221; is true every subsequent day forever!
</p>
<p>
  Beeminder is a way to make the important urgent.
Tell Beeminder the bare minimum number of weekly hours or workouts or servings or blog posts or whatever you&#8217;re measuring.
That establishes your
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/roadwidth\\"
    title=\\"Way more than you want to know about Beeminder&#39;s Yellow Brick Road\\"
  >
    Yellow Brick Road
  </a>
  .
Follow it or Beeminder will yell at you.
If that&#8217;s all you need &#8212; the reminders to stay on track &#8212; great!
Beeminder will be free for you forever.
More likely though, reminders from a bot will be too easy to ignore and you&#8217;ll derail at least once.
That&#8217;s when the true urgency comes in.
If you want to try again after your first derailment, you&#8217;ve got to
  <a href=\\"http://beeminder.com/money\\">
    pledge actual money
  </a>
  to unfreeze your yellow brick road.
[UPDATE:
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/nwo\\">
    Goals no longer freeze
  </a>
  !]
Now you really have to take that road seriously, or cough up the money you pledged.
</p>
<p>
  The initial pledge is $5 and, like the Beeminder reminders, that may prove too easy to ignore.
But that problem is soon solved as well: If you derail and pay the $5 pledge, it takes a $10 pledge the next time.
It quickly explodes after that: $30, $90, $270, and so on, tripling each time.
No matter how rich or recalcitrant you are, it won&#8217;t take many initial derailments before staying on that Yellow Brick Road is as urgent as it is important.
</p>
<p>
  You&#8217;ll get a round tuit when Beeminder says you will.

    title=\\"My Set-A-Limit goal for wasting less time\\"

    waste tons of time
  </a>
  on stupid little distractions, yet rarely watch movies or TV. 
Sitting down to do so seems like such an extravagant use of time! 
I&#8217;ve already wasted so much of it! 
I can&#8217;t possibly take 2 hours to watch a movie until I get a little more caught up on work, I admonish myself. 
I never get it through my head that I waste much more time, in aggregate, on stupid things. 
And there are a lot of movies that really seem worth the time.
Plus it&#8217;s good to just, y&#8217;know, relax now and then.
In other words, I&#8217;ve decided I&#8217;m akratic about how little [sic] TV I watch.
</p>
<p>
  Over the past 5+ years, I&#8217;ve
  <a
    href=\\"http://messymatters.com/tagtime\\"
    title=\\"How do I know this? TagTime!\\"

    averaged

  1.8 hours/week being passively entertained (not counting youtube and such at my computer).
I&#8217;ve decided to try forcing myself to spend at least that much:

  </a>
</p>
<p>
  And as you can see, I now have an emergency passive entertainment day.
Of course it&#8217;s also an emergency blog post day (hi!) and also hack night (pomodoro poker!), so it looks like I&#8217;ll be derailing on the entertainment goal.
We&#8217;ll see what kind of a

  it takes to make me take it seriously&#8230;

    <em>
      We are exceedingly proud to debut the work of our intern, Chris Goodman, in this blog post.
Chris has joined us this summer through

        Saturday Academy&#8217;s ASE Internship program
      </a>
      .
Both Chris and Saturday Academy have knocked our socks off.
Chris had not written a line of Ruby when he started, and now, well, his blog post here speaks for itself.
He far exceeded our expectations.
The original plan was simply a third-party tool to beemind tweets using the Beeminder API.
Unprompted, he dove in to the Beeminder codebase and figured out how to make it an official integration.
Enjoy! And thank you, Chris!
    </em>
  </p>

<p>
  <strong>
    UPDATE 2023: Twitter managed to ruin
    <em>
      some
    </em>
    of Chris&#8217;s work here.
Specifically, due to Twitter API changes, you can now only beemind your own tweets, and only your total number of tweets, no more hashtag-minding. :(
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  Today I, Chris the Intern, also known as

  >
    Twitter integration
  </a>
  . 
&#8220;But Eend!&#8221; you say. 
&#8220;We already have Twitter integration!&#8221;
To that I say, &#8220;Wait! Don&#8217;t go! What I added is different, I swear!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
  What we&#8217;ve had until now is the option to sign in using your Twitter account.
This integration is about actually beeminding your tweets.
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"THINGS1\\"
    href=\\"#THINGS\\"
  >
    [1]
  </a>
  The Twitter API lets you access data from any user, so there is no authentication step with Twitter.
Just type in your Twitter username, or
  <em>
    any
  </em>
  Twitter username, and you can start beeminding tweets or tweets with a specified hashtag.
If you have a friend who you feel tweets far too much, here&#8217;s a way to cure them:
Create a Twitterminder goal pointing at your friend&#8217;s Twitter acount and with the Yellow Brick Road set to a reasonable number of tweets per day.
Now show your friend the graph. 
They will not be able to resist causing you to get charged money, which they can do by tweeting less than the rate you set on your Twitterminder goal.
It&#8217;s win-win-win! 
(The third win is for Beeminder, who wins actual money in this scenario.)
</p>
<p>
  Ok, but (slightly) more seriously, if you did want beemind tweeting less, we considered adding Do Less goals for tweeting.
If you want this, all I have to do is uncomment a block of code. 
Don&#8217;t hesitate to ask if you feel this would be a good feature!
Of course that would also open doors for doing things such as giving us money every time Kim Kardashian tweets, just so you can add a monetary loss to a loss of

  &#8220;Twitterminder is about much more than minding your tweeting&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  Ok, but let&#8217;s get even more serious.
Twitterminder is actually about much more than minding your (or your friends&#8217;, or pop idols&#8217;) tweeting.
There are a lot of tools and websites and Quantified Self gadgets that integrate with Twitter and can tweet automatically when you accomplish various things, often with a specific hashtag.
Well, you can now automatically beemind all those things!
Maybe you prefer
  <a
    href=\\"http://codecademy.com\\"
    title=\\"This isn&#39;t a perfect example as Codecademy uses no hashtags by default, but you can always add your own upon completing a lesson\\"

    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/codeschool\\"
    title=\\"Blog post announcing our Code School integration\\"
  >
    Code School integration
  </a>
  .
Codecademy makes it easy to tweet your progress after each lesson, so just create a Twitterminder goal to watch those tweets.
Even more exciting, you can use
  <a
    href=\\"https://ifttt.com/help/channel_suggestion\\"
    title=\\"IFTTT = &#39;If This Then That&#39; and this link shamelessly takes you to a page where you can suggest that Beeminder be an official channel because we&#39;ve been trying to convince and they apparently need to see a bit more user demand for it first\\"
  >
    IFTTT
  </a>
  to automatically tweet on your behalf and have Beeminder subsequently count those tweets, meaning you can count any IFTTTible
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"VERB1\\"
    href=\\"#VERB\\"
  >
    [2]
  </a>
  thing.
(Technically you already could, by having IFTTT generate emails to the Beeminder bot, but it&#8217;s cleaner via Twitter and doesn&#8217;t require connecting your Gmail to IFTTT.)
</p>
<p>
  So that&#8217;s
  <a
    href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/twitter\\"

    </a>
  </p>

<p>
  You almost surely don&#8217;t! (If you do, let us know, because we have presents for you &#8212; for real.)
How about a year ago when we wrote a blog post much like this one for our first anniversary of launching?
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/one/\\">
      Launch Anniversary! How Crazy Are We Now?
    </a>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Most of you don&#8217;t remember that either.
Last year at this time, 6,000 people had signed up for Beeminder.
We&#8217;re now at 15,000.
By more important metrics, we&#8217;ve actually doubled a couple times since then.
People have started 36,000 goals with Beeminder (we were at 10,000 a year ago).
The total number of datapoints plotted is now over 2 million (it was 400,000 last year).
And the total of all pledges ever made has gone from $50,000 to $165,000 (or maybe $328,000 &#8212; this is a confusing number to calculate, what with moving up and down the pledge schedule, and for now we need to just get this blog post out the door!).
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;We’re talking upper middle class money&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  We hope it&#8217;s not too gauche, or in Beeminder&#8217;s case,

to talk about actual revenue but it&#8217;s an important metric for Beeminder&#8217;s future:
our revenue has steadily and predictably grown from $3,000 last October to a projected $14,000 this month.
So with our 3.25 FTEs, we&#8217;re talking upper middle class money here!
What that means for you, Dear Reader, is that Beeminder is not going anywhere.
We&#8217;re in this for the long haul.
</p>
<p>
  So, in that spirit, let us retrospect!
Here are some of our favorite bits from the last year.
</p>
<h3>
  Press (aka &#8220;OMG did you hear about how great Beeminder is?&#8221;)
</h3>
<p>
  The most high profile press coverage of the past year was our appearance on the front page of the
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/wsj\\"
    title=\\"It was a story about Quantified Self as &#39;digital mother&#39;\\"
  >
    Wall Street Journal
  </a>
  . 
We also had a month-long sojourn in the skies in Southwest Airlines&#8217;
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/southwest/\\">
    Spirit magazine
  </a>
  which was technically even higher profile (get it?) and certainly yielded more new users.
More recently, we appeared in Shape magazine and the Portland Business Journal, and we have 37 sightings of ourselves in the news and blogosphere since our last press roundup six months ago which we&#8217;ll blog about later.
We&#8217;re a major plot point in
  <a href=\\"http://www.nickwinter.net/\\">
    Nick Winter
  </a>
  &#8217;s book
  <em>

      The Motivation Hacker
    </a>
  </em>
  and we were a minor sponsor of the global
  <a href=\\"http://quantifiedself.com\\">
    Quantified Self
  </a>
  conference, which we&#8217;ll blog about separately soon.
</p>
<h3>
  Rules, features, improvements, baubles, widgets, wingdingers, zozzits, and fiddlesnitchen
</h3>
<p>
  Another year with Beeminder of course also means another year of improvements that you yourself can verify with your very own eyes, per our
  <a
    href=\\"http://beeminder.com/meta/uvi\\"
    title=\\"UVI = User-Visible Improvement\\"
  >
    UVI yellow brick road
  </a>
  . 
Can you guess how many User-Visible Improvements we&#8217;ve made in the last year? Yes, 365.
There are a few big headliners though.
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/glossary#retroratchet\\">
    Retroratchet

  lets you get rid of excess safety buffer.
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/breaks\\">

The
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/nwo\\">
    new world order, with precommit-to-recommit for all
  </a>
  makes for more sensible defaults &#8212; you have to intentionally quit your self-improving. 
In the same vein,
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/less\\">
    Do Less
  </a>
  goals are much more useful. 
Namely, if you ignore them, you derail!
We implemented
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/zeno\\">
    zeno polling
  </a>
  to keep bugging you more and more insistently as you approach the cliff edge of your road &#8212; incredibly valuable for certain types of goals (but only on by default for
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/gmailzero\\">
    GmailZero
  </a>
  goals currently).
</p>
<p>
  On the subject of money, we implemented pledge short-circuiting so you can move up (and down) the pledge schedule, and we gave you
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/premium\\">
    premium Beeminder

  (y&#8217;know, in case you want to pay us more money).
We also nerded out a whole bunch on the

  , it wasn&#8217;t all roses and ponies this past year.
In particular we lack ponies.
We don&#8217;t have a whole lot to say here, because we&#8217;re doing a pretty good job overall.
But we did

    refund a fair chunk of money to people in January
  </a>
  of this year when we discovered that sometimes non-legit charges were in fact getting charged, despite our attempts to cancel them!
There was a second time we initiated refunds this year, after we suddenly changed reminder settings for GmailZero goals.
We realized what a disaster that was for people who&#8217;d been relying on those urgent reminders, and it was the catalyst for implementing
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/glossary#zenop\\">

  We also had some scheduled down time once or twice, like when we moved to a new server, and upgraded

  . 
In fact, we&#8217;ve been experiencing some growing pains with our architecture in the past months: our overnight refreshes are getting slower and there&#8217;ve been far too many times when &#8212; particularly if you&#8217;re an early riser &#8212; you may have woken up to stale graphs.
This may be our excuse to switch to

Reducing the friction required to beemind All The Things is top of mind after spending two days with a group of the most motivated data nerds out there at the Quantified Self global conference this weekend. 
Even amongst the sort of people who track anything from meditation, to heart rate variability, to calorie intake, to bowel movements, to cognitive performance, and beyond, the problem of burnout is a hard one to tackle.
You&#8217;ve probably got the best chance for beemindery success if the data is passively collected, without remembering to enter it and such.

  about at least some things. 
It&#8217;s practically part of the human condition. 
I don&#8217;t know where the ambitiousness threshold is but it&#8217;s a sizable minority if not a majority. 
There&#8217;s some empirical evidence
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"THIRD1\\"
    href=\\"#THIRD\\"

    [1]
  </a>
  to suggest 1/3 is the fraction of people with enough self-awareness to appreciate the value of a commitment device. 
Integrity is another one I don&#8217;t know how to estimate, but hopefully it&#8217;s at least 50%. 
And we&#8217;re

  Embarrassed To Be Minded?
</h2>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;I needed something like Beeminder so badly that I went and built it&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  Despite my claim that we are the elite 1% with enough
  <em>
    Integrity
  </em>
  and
  <em>
    Ambition
  </em>
  (and pretty enough faces) to use Beeminder, I was surprised to discover, in the early days of Beeminder, that not everyone felt the same.
We were getting feedback about our privacy features and one user revealed that they viewed needing commitment devices as a bad signal.

  I&#8217;m obviously not used to thinking that way since my whole identity is wrapped up in the fact that I needed something like Beeminder so badly that I went and built it.
(In fact Bethany did and does more of the actual building than me but my point stands!)
</p>
<p>
  And perhaps the entire point of this post is to disagree with that person. 
If anything, and the above list makes this clear, I think it is a positive signal.
Akrasia is an extremely common problem and the ones who introspect well enough to recognize it and correct for it (and who have the kind of self-integrity to not just find a way to weasel out of every possible attempt to employ commitment devices) are, in my experience, super impressive people.
</p>
<p>
  It&#8217;s true there are the arguably even more impressive people who simply don&#8217;t suffer from akrasia in the first place. 
So if you can get away with passing yourself off as one of those people &#8212; keeping your beeminding secret &#8212; I&#8217;m not sure I have a good argument to dissuade you!
</p>
<p>
  One possible counterargument is to look at all the very clearly awesome people who proudly use Beeminder.
We&#8217;ve got open source superstars like

  is an economist and a Beeminder beta user, albeit one who has yet to partake of a commitment contract.
He asks the following:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    For those of you who have given yourselves big incentives to do something, do you ever find that you are shortchanging other important areas of your life as a result?
When you push yourself on an exercise goal or a work goal, do you miss out on sleep?
Do you depreciate your &#8220;relationship capital&#8221;?
Or do you have good reasons to believe that the multi-task incentive distortions are not a problem?
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  David is pointing out the danger of unintended consequences.
There&#8217;s even a

  :
Any intervention in any complex system will result in unanticipated and often negative consequences.

  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  I brazenly claim that this is not a problem with Beeminder contracts.
That&#8217;s because the person imposing the incentives is also the one being incentivized.
The reason you need to self-bind is that immediate consequences (like the deliciousness of the pie in front of you) act like
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/akrasia\\"
    title=\\"Inaugural post on the Beeminder blog: How To Do What You Want\\"
  >
    a drug that distorts your decision-making
  </a>
  .
Despite my use of the &#8220;multiple selves&#8221; rhetoric, there&#8217;s really just one true you:
the one deciding when all the consequences are distant (or when they&#8217;re all near).
So self-binding with a Beeminder contract means deciding something from a distance and then using a commitment device to constrain your future options so you actually stick to your decision.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  That risk pales in comparison with the near certainty of your future self running roughshod over your long-term desires and intentions.
</h4>
<p>
  It&#8217;s true you can be wrong and the commitment can turn out to be a mistake but that&#8217;s a different sense of &#8220;unintended consequences&#8221; &#8212; a much more benign sense.
For the kinds of goals suitable for beeminding, that risk pales in comparison with the near certainty of your future self running roughshod over your long-term desires and intentions.
(See the definition of
  <em>
    akrasia
  </em>
  in the sidebar.)
And you can always be very conservative with your goals.
Forget your fantastical notions about losing 20 pounds by summer and just commit to at least not
  <em>
    gaining
  </em>
  weight.
Something where you know that if you fail it&#8217;s overwhelmingly likely that it was due to akrasia.
</p>
<p>
  To answer David&#8217;s original question more directly: 
No, I&#8217;m beeminding exactly the areas of my life that I&#8217;m shortchanging to begin with.
I pre-commit to, for example, working more because I don&#8217;t like where my time goes when I decide moment to moment how to spend it.
If I overdo it and find I&#8217;m working too much then I&#8217;ll just dial it back down next time.

  Upside-down support is what we call it when we turn a support request from a user upside-down and ask for the user&#8217;s help to improve the app or website the user needs support with. 
We&#8217;ve collected various techniques for doing this over the years and it makes so many things in support so much better.
We even have a much better way to say no to users!
</p>
<p>
  First, in case any of our users are still in the room,
  <a

    id=\\"ROOM1\\"
    href=\\"#ROOM\\"

  </a>

  It turns out that trying to be the diametric opposite of helpful to users in support delights them all the more.
Weird, right?
But less weird than it sounds.
Let us explain, first by quoting ourselves from seven years ago, since this has clearly stood the test of time:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    I spotted this in an old email from one of us: 
&#8220;Let me know if there&#8217;s anything else I can help you with!&#8221; 
Perfectly informal and sounds so friendly and helpful. 
But I’ve come to believe that it backfires.
    <br>
    &nbsp;
    <br>
    First, people are thoroughly cynical about companies wanting to &#8220;help&#8221; them. 
Second, psychology! 
People want to help people. 
They go out of their way to do so. 
People are nice, even altruistic. 
They don&#8217;t want to take up our time asking questions.
    <br>
    &nbsp;
    <br>
    When we were just getting started and willing to do pretty much anything for our initial users, Melanie, our resident fitness expert, would offer advice and coaching and people would think to themselves 
&#8220;well, that’s not fair, I’m not paying for that&#8221;.
    <br>
    &nbsp;
    <br>
    You can bend over backwards offering help and it makes users feel guilty or suspicious and ignore you. 
If you ask
    <em>
      them
    </em>
    for help &#8212; or make clear that asking you questions is not a burden but a vital form of feedback that you need for improving the product &#8212; then they respond effusively, and bend over backwards to help you.
    <br>
    &nbsp;
    <br>
    It&#8217;s an empirical fact. 
People respond better to helping us than us helping them. 
To be clear, this is no gimmick. 
Users only need our help in the first place because our website sucks. 
We&#8217;re not helping them, we&#8217;re just making up for the sucking (and learning how to unsuckify it). 
So no matter how much you help someone, don&#8217;t talk about it that way. 
Turn it around and explicitly thank them for helping you suck less.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Since we wrote that, we&#8217;ve really doubled down. 
How so?
I&#8217;ll start with a fictional example from our
  <a

  </a>
  for new support workerbees.
The scenario is a user who&#8217;s being kind of obtuse and a little demanding:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Hi! Oops! Sorry! I didn&#8217;t submit my information on time again and then I didn&#8217;t notice this until today so the charge has already gone through. 
This wasn&#8217;t a legitimate charge because my cat ate my phone and I couldn&#8217;t enter the data. 
Afterwards, I hit the wrong button (button A) again instead of&#8230; button B, I think? 
So now my goal is broken again. 
Can you fix that for me? 
I know there&#8217;s a way for me to fix it, but I&#8217;ve been really busy this week and I just can&#8217;t remember how it works and keep breaking it.
    <br>
    Thanks!
    <br>
    Userperson
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  One goal is to make them happy, of course, but our primary goal is to turn the interaction upside-down and make it about helping Beeminder.
Here was my own off-the-cuff attempt, pretending I was in support replying to that person:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    hey userperson! 
eek, we need your help! 
can you show us a screenshot and write down some of your internal dialog so we can figure out how to make this button-A-vs-button-B thing easier for people? 
and then the same for fixing it (button C is probably what you&#8217;re thinking of). 
the fact that you can&#8217;t remember and worry about breaking it is really important for us to understand better. 
(if you do break it, we&#8217;ll of course fix it for you; we just really need to understand how that kind of confusion/frustration arises.) 
thank you so much for helping making beeminder better!
    <br>
    &nbsp;
    <br>
    ps, i did the refund for this goal. 
it really helps us when you can reply quickly when something&#8217;s not legit.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Here&#8217;s a non-fictional example where a user called non-legit on a derailment because they didn&#8217;t get Beeminder&#8217;s reminders and we replied like so:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Yikes, that&#8217;s extremely bad that the Beeminder emails stopped coming through for you. 
Can you go to beeminder.com/reminders and confirm that the checkboxes for email are still checked? 
You can also go to an individual goal&#8217;s settings tab and send a test reminder and see if that comes through.
Really appreciate your help figuring out what went wrong there!
Deliverability problems with email could be devastating for us.
    <br>
    &nbsp;
    <br>
    PS, canceled the charge and undid the derailment on your ____ goal.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  In both cases above, we ignored the user&#8217;s actual request (until addressing it in a PS as an afterthought) and instead recruited them to help diagnose what went wrong.
Importantly, we include &#8220;user was confused&#8221; as something going wrong with Beeminder!
</p>
<p>
  (Clarification from Support Czar Nicky:
In the case of an actual refund or canceling a charge, it&#8217;s probably worth making it a prescript rather than a postscript.
It can still be written as incidental, just that users can be very anxious until getting the reassurance that their money&#8217;s safe and sound.
After that they can better engage with the rest of the reply!)
</p>
<p>
  I think doing this is harder than it seems.
For my cofounder and me, it comes a bit more naturally.
Beeminder is our baby and whatever caused this user to email you, it&#8217;s ultimately our fault and it stings and our thoughts immediately go to how to fix the root problem &#8212; how to make Beeminder better.
</p>
<p>
  But even for us, it&#8217;s taken training and practice and pushing ourselves out of our comfort zones.
Our support workerbees &#8212; Nicky and Simone and Robin &#8212; are extraordinarily good and kind humans and every instinct in their bodies screams at them to leap to your assistance when you email support with a problem.
So it takes very conscious control to flip the interactions upside down.
</p>
<h2>
  Tips and tricks
</h2>
<p>
  Big companies have ruined most variants of &#8220;thanks for the feedback&#8221;.
Here&#8217;s a way to not just express appreciation but demonstrate it:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Keep this kind of feedback coming; hugely helpful!
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  I like how it&#8217;s particularly unapologetic about the upside-down-ness.
It&#8217;s literally an imperative: keep doing this (because it goes without saying that the point of support is improving Beeminder).
Or here&#8217;s a less direct version:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Ok, I fixed your thing; thanks for highlighting the confusingness of this; it really helps us figure out how to make this work better for newbees!
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Sometimes it seems like there&#8217;s no way to turn a support interaction upside-down.
The user has some problem, only you can fix it, so you do, and now you need to tell them you did.
Even then, we reframe it as helping Beeminder.
Think about what the ideal version of Beeminder would&#8217;ve done to have avoided the problem in the first place.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Oh no! I think ideally Beeminder should ____ or ____ in a case like this. 
Or maybe ____ would make it moot?
Thanks for the help in thinking this through!
    <br>
    &nbsp;
    <br>
    PS: I fixed this for you for this instance.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Next trick, from Support Czar Nicky again:
for any support interaction which isn&#8217;t 100% routine, you want to come away with
  <em>
    at least
  </em>
  one piece of useful feedback.
For instance, we often get people asking us to put in breaks because they won&#8217;t be able to enter data.
It&#8217;d be easy to just do that, assuming they forgot.
Don&#8217;t assume! 
You&#8217;ve got to
  <em>
    ask
  </em>
  .
So here&#8217;s an example:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Oh no! Normally when you need breaks, you need to put them in a week in advance, because of the akrasia horizon.
It would help us a lot to understand better how that can go wrong for people. 
In your case was it 
(a) not knowing how to put in breaks or 
(b) not knowing you needed to do it in advance? 
 
I&#8217;ve gone ahead and put in the break for you since it&#8217;s too late for you to add it yourself, but definitely let us know what tripped you up! 
It really helps us figure out how to improve the interface and the documentation.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>
  A better way to say no
</h2>
<p>
  Suppose a user is all entitled and asks for special treatment in some way, like, 
&#8220;can you short-circuit my pledge to go straight to $810? 
I don&#8217;t want to pay for a month of premium to do that for just that one goal?&#8221;
We&#8217;re way too fairness-obsessed to say yes to something like that, but upside-down support gives us a much better way to say no than something like 
&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry but our policy is&#8230;&#8221;.
We can instead do this:
</p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Hi ____, I sure love how you think! 
And this is also really good feedback that it feels a little &#8230; unfair? money-grubbing? I&#8217;m not sure how to put it&#8230; that we don&#8217;t let you set your own pledge level without the fancy premium plan. 
Some of the history behind our thinking on this is at

​Actually it would be really good to have you read that and see if it changes your mind about our stance on this, or if you have ideas for us on either how we could convey this better so that it seems more fair or, if it doesn&#8217;t convince you, what actually would feel the most fair to you.
  <br>
  &nbsp;
  <br>
  ​
​​Thanks so much for all the beeminding and helping us think this stuff through! 
Can we send you stickers? Tell us a postal address if so!
</p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
  That&#8217;s not
  <em>
    exactly
  </em>
  a no.
The door is open a crack to change our minds, but they&#8217;d have to make the argument from Beeminder&#8217;s perspective, not their own.
(Also notice that they&#8217;re getting stickers as a consolation prize.)
</p>
<h2>
  Don&#8217;t be helpful!
</h2>
<p>
  In conclusion, don&#8217;t do things for users that they could do themselves. 
Point them in the right direction and ask for feedback about how easy it is to find and do. 
And even when the support request really does require you to do something for the user, always explicitly shift the focus to the user helping you (the business/startup/app), not you helping them.
</p>
<p>
  I also want to re-emphasize the genuineness of all this. 
We really do need users&#8217; help in understanding what Beeminder could&#8217;ve done better to have avoided the problems users email us about &#8212; figuring out the root issues. 
And asking for help is really hard. 
But it&#8217;s worth it and we&#8217;ve gone to great lengths to overcome our fear of doing it and Beeminder support interactions tend to be pretty amazing because of it. 
Well, that and our amazing support workerbees.

  We&#8217;ll de-emphasize, by burying it in this footnote, the cold-blooded corporate take that upside-down support gets users feeling more invested in your app.
I think that&#8217;s true too but we&#8217;re not exactly being Machiavellian here.
We&#8217;re quite sincere that this is all quite win-win.
Again, our users keep saying our support is the best they&#8217;ve ever seen.
So unless we&#8217;ve really brainwashed them, it&#8217;s probably not particularly cold-blooded.
The warm-fuzzy way to put it might be that it puts you and your users on the same team.
Support interactions take on a collaborative tone.

  Today marks the beginning of the 17th annual NaNoWriMo.
For the uninitiated that&#8217;s NAtional NOvel WRIting MOnth. 
For 17 years folks have been joining together on the internet over the month of November to pen their own 50,000 word novels.
</p>
<p>
  This year they expect half a million participants.
</p>
<p>
  That&#8217;s a lot of people trying to write a lot of words in the month of November.
To reach the target that means that each of them needs to maintain an average of 1666 words per day.
</p>
<p>
  And imagine if you were to fall behind and skip a day! 
That&#8217;s gonna catch up to you pretty quickly! 
Know what would be perfect? 
If you had some kind of way to make sure you spread your progress out evenly over the whole 30 days&#8230;
</p>
<p>
  Okay. Is anyone surprised that we think this is a fabulous use case for Beeminder?
</p>
<p>
  We&#8217;ve got several ways to beemind your writing that we&#8217;ll describe below but since 24 hours of NaNoWriMo is already gone you may want to just&#8230;

<h2>
  Draft
</h2>
<p>
  First up we&#8217;ve got our
  <a
    href=\\"http://beeminder.com/draft\\"
    title=\\"Or Draft itself lives at draftin.com\\"
  >
    integration with Draft
  </a>
  .
Draft provides a super simple interface for just writing. 
And they have useful writerly tools, like Hemmingway mode, where they disable the backspace key. 
Though, shouldn&#8217;t that be Faulkner mode or something? 
I&#8217;m not sure I write more simply and directly when I have no eraser. 
On second thought this is probably some English Major in-joke that my dad would be disappointed at me missing.
Draft&#8217;s killer feature, though, is its structured revision control. 
They have really great tools for collaborating, offering edits, or just keeping track of the evolution of your drafts.
</p>
<p>
  However, our Draft integration may not be the best tool for NaNoWriMo, because we don&#8217;t do a straight wordcount. 
We actually pull in the total number of edits, so we include words added and words deleted. 
Which is a really great metric for keeping track of writing, but less useful for NaNoWriMo.
NaNoWriMo&#8217;s about churning out a first draft no matter what, not about a polished end product.
</p>
<h2>
  URLminder
</h2>
<p>
  URLminder has existed as a standalone tool for years but this year we finally made it part of Beeminder proper.
The idea is to just let Beeminder watch a URL or set of URLs where you&#8217;re doing your writing and mind the total word count, automatically.
This could be a URL from a Git repo (I&#8217;m pretty sure that using Git for version control for writing is a great idea).
This could be the &#8220;shareable link&#8221; from a Google Doc &#8212; you don&#8217;t have to make it public.
Or from Dropbox.
Any publicly accessible URL you point us to.
</p>
<h2>
  Manual minding
</h2>
<p>
  Finally you could of course create a manual entry Beeminder goal.
For NaNoWriMo, you&#8217;ll want to track the wordcount, probably, so an Odometer goal (available with an Infinibee subscription of $4/month), would make the most sense. 
Otherwise you&#8217;d have to enter the deltas &#8212; how many words you wrote each day.
With an Odometer goal you report today&#8217;s total wordcount, which your word processor presumably tells you, every time the bot bugs you.
</p>
<p>
  Go forth and invent.

He points out that if one of his Y Combinator startups is regularly doing new deals and releases and, importantly, sending updates to Graham and colleagues, they&#8217;re probably going to live.

<p>
  Then, admitting how naive it sounds, he gets to the crazy part: &#8220;Maybe the linkage works in both directions. Maybe if you can arrange that we keep hearing from you, you won&#8217;t die.&#8221;
He defends the claim by pointing out that

  </a>
  $1000 if we don&#8217;t improve Beeminder in some visible way by midnight tonight!
</p>
<p>
  Once you have a graph like that, let your users know (even if you only have a handful of beta users initially) that you&#8217;re on the hook to announce a User-Visible Improvement (UVI) once a day on average.
We tweet ours to a special Twitter account &#8212;
  <a href=\\"http://twitter.com/beemuvi\\">
    @beemuvi
  </a>
  &#8212; but any public changelog will do.
</p>
<p>
  Ours have ranged from trivial, e.g.,
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    &#8220;Added some padding so the Feedback button doesn&#8217;t overlap the text if you make your browser too skinny. HT Judy Soule.&#8221;
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  to epic, like recently:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    &#8220;
    <a href=\\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.beeminder.beeminder&amp;hl=en\\">
      Android App v2.0!
    </a>
    Vastly faster &amp; includes a built in timer app for beeminding how much time you spend on things&#8230;&#8221;
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  You can start with a very unambitious definition of &#8220;improvement&#8221;.
When we originally
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/rails\\"
    title=\\"Note that that was from 6 months before our public launch\\"
  >
    announced
  </a>
  our commitment to do this we listed all of the following as things that count:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    New blog posts
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixing typos
  </li>
  <li>
    Tweaking the layout or the logo or whatever
  </li>
  <li>
    Improvements to how the bot responds to emails
  </li>
  <li>
    Tweaks to the algorithm for generating the yellow brick road
  </li>
  <li>
    Tweets from our main twitter account (
    <a
      href=\\"http://twitter.com/bmndr\\"
      title=\\"@bmndr is Beeminder's main Twitter account and we use @beemuvi to tweet our User-Visible Improvements\\"
    >
      @bmndr
    </a>
    )
  </li>
  <li>
    Improvements to the log in procedure or payment processing
  </li>
  <li>
    Any new feature or tweak to any feature
  </li>
  <li>
    New tips-of-the-day in the email responses from the bot
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Basically, anything that makes Beeminder better, even in the most tiny, trivial way.
Over the last 1000 days, we&#8217;ve gradually gotten more ambitious.
Fixing typos and adding tips of the day and whatnot don&#8217;t count anymore.
Bugfixes and CSS tweaks still do.
And we have a separate graph for blog posts, which you can see in the sidebar, so this article doesn&#8217;t count as a UVI.
</p>
<p>
  The real criterion is simply anything we&#8217;re not ashamed to publicly announce as our UVI of the day.
We have (just) enough pride that we&#8217;d rather cough up the $1000 than tweet anything that clearly violates the spirit of the commitment.
</p>
<h3>
  Close Calls
</h3>
<p>
  In fact, there have been two occasions where we were ready to cough it up.
The first was two years ago when we first visited Portland to interview for the
  <a href=\\"http://portlandseedfund.com\\">
    Portland Seed Fund
  </a>
  .
The time zone change threw us off and, although we had deployed an improvement earlier in the day, we forgot to publicly tweet it by official midnight.
At that point we had few enough salivating users watching like hawks that no one called us out in the 20 minutes or so before we remembered and got the tweet out.
We would definitely have paid if someone had.

  </a>
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;We have coughed up hundreds of dollars to our users on other meta graphs.&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  More recently, we deployed our daily UVI and even publicly tweeted it, but forgot to update the actual graph (which we still do manually, but we recommend you set up an
  <a
    href=\\"https://ifttt.com/recipes/86058\\"

This is an example recipe for sending a +1 to a Beeminder graph whenever a new RSS item appears at some feed URL.\\"
  >
    IFTTT recipe
  </a>
  to auto-update yours!).
We actually convened a little tribunal to rule on whether we should cough up the $1000 in that case.
The verdict from our users was no, we&#8217;re subject to the standard grace period for getting data manually entered.
Phew!
We have
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/blogdog\\"
    title=\\"This is the blog post with the fine print and where you can claim our money by being the first to post a comment outing us as off track on our goal\\"
  >
    coughed up
  </a>
  hundreds of dollars to our users on other meta graphs &#8212; recently $270 for not getting a blog post out on time, and $90 each for our &#8220;40 hours/week on Beeminder&#8221; goals &#8212; but not yet thousands.
</p>
<p>
  But at this point, if we do cough up this $1000 it will have been worth it about 100 times over. (And we&#8217;d immediately re-up and keep ourselves on the hook.)
Even aside from the commitment device, about which more shortly, our change log is super handy for looking up what happened when, like when we compose monthly update emails and whatnot.
Or even for debugging sometimes. 
In theory we have the git history but that&#8217;s too cumbersome and noisy.
</p>
<h3>
  Signaling Value
</h3>
<p>
  This has been immensely important for us as a commitment device to stay focused on forward progress, but we&#8217;re extreme in our need for lifehacky tricks like that to keep ourselves on track &#8212; which is why we made Beeminder in the first place, i.e., itch-scratching.
We&#8217;re entirely serious when we say that Beeminder would not exist if it weren&#8217;t for beeminding Beeminder this way, particularly our UVI goal forcing inexorable forward progress even when we felt demoralized.
</p>
<p>
  If you think you don&#8217;t need to do this to survive, then, first of all, reread Paul Graham&#8217;s
  <a href=\\"http://www.paulgraham.com/die.html\\">
    How Not to Die
  </a>
  .
Note the part about how demoralizing startups can be.
&#8220;The low points in a startup are just unbelievably low,&#8221; Graham says. 
&#8220;I bet even Google had moments where things seemed hopeless.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
  But even if you don&#8217;t need to play this kind of trick on yourself, there&#8217;s huge value in signaling your commitment to steady progress and improvement.
Prospective users place a surprising amount of weight on things like &#8220;how long ago was the latest blog post&#8221; and other such heuristics for whether you&#8217;re still in active development. 
Probably because it&#8217;s so common for startups to peter out despite the front page still being all &#8220;everything&#8217;s great! sign up now!&#8221;
Watching your public changelog will mean more to your users than you can imagine, and will be persuasive to new users, not to mention making them more tolerant of your foibles.
They know you&#8217;re getting better every day!

  Addendum: Holy Moly, We Actually Paid Up On This
</h3>
<p>
  UPDATE 2013-12-03:
We&#8217;ve now actually paid the $1000 on this, to

  >
    fine print
  </a>
  .
Ouch!
But of course, at 98 cents per UVI, this has been a steal!
Not that we purposefully derailed, or even got especially lackadaisical about it after this article gushing about how great our UVI commitment is.
We even said, portentiously, that &#8220;at this point, if we do cough up this $1000 it will have been worth it about 100 times over.&#8221;
So, yeah. Still true.
But still silly to actually derail like that!
</p>
<p>
  The actual reason for the derailment was just the confluence of multiple beemergencies. 
Most notably our
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/beedroid\\">
    Android blog post
  </a>
  (our
  <a href=\\"http://beeminder.com/meta/blog\\">
    blogging commitment
  </a>
  is itself up to $810 at stake).
We had some candidate UVIs written down and I was meaning to discuss them with Bethany (aka Queen Bee, aka our CTO) before we tweeted one.
But we got wholly distracted by the emergency blog post, coming right down to wire and hitting publish at 23:59:30.
We even spent another hour improving the post, forgetting all about the UVI beemergency until I saw the fateful blog comment come in.
</p>
<p>
  Heightening the sting of this, we had actually deployed one of the UVIs and merely failed to tweet it in time.
It was tempting to call that close enough.
But after a previous close call (where we
  <em>
    did
  </em>
  tweet it in time and just forgot to update the graph in time) we decided on &#8220;tweeted by midnight&#8221; as the defining criterion for fulfilling the commitment.
So there was simply no weasel room and so we paid up.
</p>
<p>
  We also said, when we wrote this article, &#8220;we&#8217;d immediately re-up and keep ourselves on the hook,&#8221; which is what we&#8217;ve done.
Another $1000 is on the line with nary a day&#8217;s respite!
(Which, we should emphasize, is all far harsher than is the norm for Beeminder, but for this flagship Beeminder goal we like the extreme stringency.)

  The graph itself isn&#8217;t the most important part in this case &#8212; we want to convince you first of all to create a public changelog and commit to changing it, publicly.
That alone is a commitment device if you have users watching, though surprisingly easy to get behind on, deluding yourself that you&#8217;ll catch back up soon, until it&#8217;s hopeless.
If you want to
  <em>
    really
  </em>
  get yourself on the hook and follow our example,

    title=\\"You can sign in with the usual suspects, including Github\\"
  >
    sign up for Beeminder
  </a>
  and create a new goal &#8212; a &#8220;Do More&#8221; goal &#8212; committing to one user-visible improvement per day (7 per week, or maybe start with 5 per week, or even just 3 per week to start out &#8212; you can always dial it up later).

  Two clarifications: We don&#8217;t yet have annotations like that. Those were added in post-production. But we&#8217;ll surely have them within 1000 days/UVIs from now!
And, two, you don&#8217;t have to put $1000 at stake like that off the bat. 
In fact, you don&#8217;t put any money at stake at first, nor do you ever have to as long as you keep all your datapoints on your Yellow Brick Road.

  We hold ourselves to a stricter standard for our own meta Beeminder contracts.
For our users, you can always just tell us that a derailment was due to a technicality and we&#8217;ll believe you and not charge you.
For ourselves we have some stringent fine print.
But we should also point out that Beeminder contracts are much less scary than they sound.
Certainly less so than our esteemed competitor,
  <a
    href=\\"http://stickk.com\\"
    title=\\"StickK = put a contract out on yourself, as opposed to Beeminder which is like StickK for data nerds -- Commitment Contracts plus Quantified Self\\"
  >

  </a>
  .
Part of the beauty of Beeminder is that you can reassess your commitment or end it altogether at any time, with a one week delay.
So you can adjust your goal, but you can&#8217;t change it out of laziness, unless you&#8217;re particularly forward-thinking about your laziness!

  Ok, there&#8217;s &#8220;technically&#8221; and there&#8217;s &#8220;technically&#8221;.
If your definition of a vegetarian is &#8220;someone who never eats meat&#8221; then I&#8217;m pretty stuck on making good on this title.
But someone who ate meat in the past and doesn&#8217;t anymore counts, of course.
So maybe there&#8217;s wiggle room here?
Someone who eats meat only at Christmas dinner and never any other time is arguably
  <em>
    almost
  </em>
  a vegetarian.
So far so fair, right?
</p>
<p>
  If you are a vegetarian on odd days of the month, fastidiously, do you count as half a vegetarian?
And if you eat no meat during spring, autumn, and most of summer, can you round yourself up to &#8220;vegetarian&#8221;?
Probably not really, but that&#8217;s the technicality I&#8217;m angling for.

After a while you just get used to it.
It&#8217;s like quitting smoking. 
It&#8217;s really hard for a while but then it&#8217;s fine.

  The beauty of being an actual vegetarian is that it&#8217;s an unambiguous constraint. 
&#8220;I can&#8217;t eat that because I&#8217;m a vegetarian.&#8221; 
Everyone gets that and accommodates it.
If you don&#8217;t go whole hog, so to (unfortunately) speak, then it&#8217;s pretty hard to not slide down a slippery slope of carnivoracity.
I mean, there&#8217;s the concept of

  but it hasn&#8217;t caught on as far as I can tell, so &#8220;I can&#8217;t eat that because it&#8217;s Monday&#8221; doesn&#8217;t feel compelling. 
But &#8220;I can&#8217;t eat that because I&#8217;m a vegetarian today because Beeminder&#8221; works great!

</h4>
<p>
  Oh, hi, welcome to the Beeminder blog!
We sometimes call Beeminder &#8220;safety rope for slippery slopes&#8221;.
It&#8217;s a commitment device app that lets you specify a quantifiable, graphable goal and holds you to it under threat of monetary penalty.
</p>
<p>
  Of course identifying as a vegetarian is also a commitment device.
It&#8217;s what prevents &#8220;one hamburger just this once&#8221; from becoming ALL HAMBURGERS ALL THE TIME.
(Or whenever one is offered.)
Being a vegetarian prevents that by ensuring you never set foot on the slippery slope to begin with.
</p>
<p>
  Beeminder prevents it by being a

    title=\\"Guest post by Scott Alexander of Slate Star Codex on the Beeminder blog\\"

    Schelling fence
  </a>
  that only lets you slide so far down the slippery slope.
How far? However far you precommit to!
Mine is committing me to average 3.6 [UPDATE: now 5] vegetarian days per week:

</p>
<p>
  That way I can technically say I&#8217;m &#8220;mostly a vegetarian&#8221;.
My fine print is that I can enter a 1 at the end of the day if I had no meat.
If I only had fish then I can enter a 1/2.
</p>
<h2>
  And why?
</h2>
<p>
  To eat less meat!
Because of your health maybe?
To set a good example or otherwise align yourself with fighting climate change?
Because it&#8217;s hard to be certain that cows and pigs don&#8217;t count as sentient?
Or because factory farming is cruel.
</p>
<p>
  Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re philosophically on board with being vegetarian but psychologically / gastronomically it doesn&#8217;t feel realistic for you.

  Well, Beeminder is a way to make a meaningful partial commitment to the cause.
Without Beeminder, your choices were probably all or nothing.
If, in practice, &#8220;all&#8221; was off the table, then Beeminder is better than &#8220;nothing&#8221;!

  A lot of people hate eating their vegetables, but I think what they really hate is eating salads. 
Salads seem to be the American standard for Health Food.
They&#8217;re the only vegetable matter that is served in many restaurants.
</p>
<p>
  I&#8217;m a vegetable fan, and salads can be super tasty. 
But they are so much work to make! 
All those different ingredients and the chopping and the tossing and the dressing. 
And then &#8212; then! &#8212; you still have to eat the thing. 
So. Much. Chewing. 
And it won&#8217;t stay on your fork and you&#8217;re using your fingers and they&#8217;re getting all greasy from the dressing. 
And at the last second the lettuce slips a little and hangs there from your lip, half in your mouth and half out.
</p>
<p>
  No wonder people think they hate eating their vegetables! 
If salad is the only vegetable you know, you&#8217;d be over it by now.
</p>
<p>
  Fortunately there&#8217;s tons of stuff in the produce section that you will rarely find in a restaurant. 
If you explore a little you can find tons of nutritious and delicious plant-fibery-things you could be eating. 
Don&#8217;t be afraid to add fat to your vegetables and pan fry them or roast them whenever possible. 
Roasted cauliflower. 
Roasted beets. 
Pan roasted brussel sprouts. 
Stuffed squash. 
Broccoli salad. 
These things are super yummy and nutrient dense. 
Even better, all these things you can
  <em>
    easily
  </em>
  stab with a fork!

  Do you have trouble eating an appropriate amount of vegetables?
Do you repeatedly buy them, then watch them wither and decay, feeling guilty about the waste of money and the impact on your health?
Do you find healthy eating to be overwhelmingly complicated?

  </a>
  was essential of course.
Before Beeminder, my best effort was a mere four days.
When I discovered Beeminder I created a simple do-more goal with a rate of seven per day, and suddenly found that I just could not bear to let the goal fail.
</p>
<p>
  The best advice I can give you though is not about Beeminder itself; it&#8217;s tips to help you make vegetable eating easier.
</p>
<p>
  If you&#8217;ve done research into a healthy diet, you&#8217;ve probably seen a great deal of advice, some contradictory, that makes it all seem complicated and hard: 
eat a wide variety of vegetables, 
a wide range of vegetable colours, 
don&#8217;t include potatoes, 
DO include potatoes, 
include legumes but only one serving per day, 
eat cooked vegetables, 
eat raw vegetables, 
eat both cooked and raw vegetables, 
use some cooking methods but not others&#8230;
Much of that advice is indeed very good, but for someone starting out, it&#8217;s just too much!
So many things to consider, so many ways you might get it wrong &#8212; for a long time I found it so overwhelming I just gave up and didn&#8217;t try.
So, my first tip: Ignore it all!
For the first few months at least, just eat whatever kinds of fruits and vegetables you feel like, cooked (or not) in whatever way you can manage, and focus on nothing more than getting seven servings a day into your body.
Don&#8217;t even worry about the fruit-to-vegetable ratio &#8212; if you have to eat four bananas in one day to make up your seven servings, do it!
It&#8217;s still better than four chocolate bars.
After you&#8217;ve become more used to eating vegetables, you&#8217;ll find it easier to expand your range, and your tastes will change so that you&#8217;ll enjoy them more.
For now, just do the best you can without becoming stressed about it, and worry about improving the details later.
</p>
<p>
  Also ignore well-meaning friends who tell you that eating properly is easy.
It is &#8212; for them.
If it were easy for you, you&#8217;d already be doing it.
And keep in mind that it will be hard for you if you try to do it perfectly from the beginning, so don&#8217;t try!
Initially, take the easiest, laziest path that you can while still meeting your goal.
The first few months are about nothing but habit building and getting yourself used to vegetables.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;An approximation is good enough, especially if it will make you more likely to stick to your goal.&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  To help with this, reduce any effort barriers.
Is it hard to make time to go shopping for fresh produce?
Find an online delivery website, perhaps even one that does regular weekly deliveries so that you can&#8217;t procrastinate about ordering your next box.
Avoid peeling unless essential.
Boil vegetables briefly in a very small amount of water or use a microwave steamer to lightly cook them.
Many vegetables can be eaten raw, which is easiest of all and you might be surprised at how pleasant raw vegetables can be once you become used to them.
Raw capsicums (bell peppers) are crunchy and sweet.
Baby carrots are nature&#8217;s finger-food.
Potatoes of course need to be thoroughly cooked, but even that can be done in a microwave &#8212; put in a whole potato by itself for five or ten minutes and it&#8217;s done.
Make everything about vegetable preparation as simple as it can be for you.
</p>
<p>
  What about accurately measuring serving sizes?
Don&#8217;t try to do it accurately!
An approximation is good enough, especially if it will make you more likely to stick to your goal.
There are two easy ways to measure servings.
If you are at home with scales at hand, use weight.
If you are eating out, use volume.
And there&#8217;s a clever trick for that, but first we&#8217;ll cover weight.
</p>
<p>
  If you&#8217;ve done any research into serving sizes, you&#8217;ve probably seen a bit of variation in the recommended weights.
For vegetables it&#8217;s usually about 75g to 80g per serving (I use 80g).
For fresh fruit, it&#8217;s often either 80g or 150g per serving (I use 80g, for the simplicity of consistency with vegetables).
For dried fruits you do need to use a different weight because they contain much less water than fresh fruit.
A common recommendation is 30g but if you have trouble remembering that, just use 40g &#8212; exactly half the weight of a serving of vegetables.
If you&#8217;re eating several fruits and vegetables at once, don&#8217;t try to measure them individually.
Put them all on the scales together, and divide the total weight by 80 to get the number of servings.
</p>
<p>
  When you can&#8217;t weigh your food (or can&#8217;t be bothered) use this easy volume trick: one serving of vegetables is about the size of your fist.
At a restaurant, before you start eating, discreetly rest your fist by the side of your plate for a moment and do a rough comparison with the size of the vegetables. 
Remember the number for later or use the ingenious
  <a
    href=\\"http://knittingabacus.com/\\"
    title=\\"dreeves uses one of these to count servings of sugar\\"
  >
    abacus bracelet
  </a>
  to keep a tally (which is also discreet enough to do while socialising).
The one exception is uncooked leafy green vegetables.
If you poke at the
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/vegetables/\\"
    title=\\"Bethany&#39;s blog post about vegetables\\"
  >
    pile of lettuce
  </a>
  , 
you&#8217;ll see how much fresh air there is inside it.
Because of this, one serving of lettuce is actually two closed fists.
This volume meansurement trick is not perfect but it&#8217;s good enough!
If you&#8217;re worried about cheating on your goal, you could deliberately underestimate a little.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;Discreetly rest your fist by the side of your plate for a moment and do a rough comparison with the size of the vegetables.&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  Back in the early days of my veggieminding, I was meeting my goal each day, but procrastinating about it so much that I&#8217;d find myself having to eat the final few vegetables just before bedtime.
When I became sick of this, I made it a rule that part of my morning routine is to prepare the day&#8217;s worth of vegetables.
If it&#8217;s a work day I&#8217;ll pack a lunchbox with vegetables, mostly raw, cut into bite sized pieces so they are easy to eat.
On a home day, I&#8217;ll fill a bowl with them and I&#8217;ll leave it on the kitchen table.
Throughout the day I&#8217;ll snack on them whenever I&#8217;m in the vicinity.
I can get through a full day&#8217;s supply without even noticing the effort of eating them.
</p>
<p>
  Preparing them all in advance also helps enormously with measuring the vegetable servings.
When you&#8217;ve filled up the lunchbox or bowl, weigh the whole thing and make note of it.
As you are eating, put any uneaten parts back in the bowl (banana skins, apple cores).
At the end of the day, weigh everything that&#8217;s left, subtract it from the first weight, and divide by 80g to get the number of servings eaten.
</p>
<p>
  The most important thing to remember through all of this is that you don&#8217;t need to do this perfectly.
As long as you&#8217;re eating better than you used to be, you&#8217;re doing just fine!

  This is going to start out sounding super common-sensical but will leap to a characteristically preposterous-sounding conclusion that I, characteristically, actually believe.
Not as preposterous-sounding as, say,

    title=\\"Preposterous *sounding* but we&#39;re dead serious!\\"

  </a>
  , but still.
</p>
<p>
  The obvious part is that if you have food left on your plate but are full, it&#8217;s more wasteful (waistful, har har) to put it in your face than to put it in the trash.
Eating food your body doesn&#8217;t need helps no one, least of all you.
</p>
<p>
  It
  <em>
    feels
  </em>
  more wasteful to throw it away, because, well, we were raised that way.
And maybe also because of cognitive dissonance.
The real wastefulness was serving yourself too much food in the first place and by cleaning your plate you don&#8217;t have to admit that you did that.
</p>
<p>
  So here&#8217;s the crazy part: Let&#8217;s teach our kids to always throw food away!
Like pretend we&#8217;re in a culture where it&#8217;s rude to completely clean your plate.
(How is it ever rude to
  <a
    href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_Plate_Club\\"
    title=\\"It was a government campaign started in 1917, basically the opposite of what I&#39;m proposing in this post\\"
  >
    clean your plate
  </a>
  ?
When it sends the message that your host didn&#8217;t serve you enough.
The internet tells me that&#8217;s how it is in China.)
</p>
<p>
  Imagine you were raised with the habit of always leaving some food uneaten.
How would you decide how much to leave?
Probably by listening to your dang stomach.
</p>
<p>
  The key is to break the habit of shoveling food off your plate on autopilot.
Adopting a policy of always leaving some there would achieve that.
Because stopping at any point before the plate is clean requires paying attention.
And for weight loss, paying attention is half the battle.
Or some generous portion of the battle anyway.
</p>
<h3>
  But Think Of The Children!
</h3>
<p>
  Here&#8217;s a possibly pedantic point for a first-world audience, and maybe the thing that makes this whole post genuinely stupid for any other audience.
If food were precious enough then it would in fact make sense to overeat rather than throw food away.
Because overeating right now means you can go longer without eating later.
So it&#8217;s not quite true that the food is fully wasted by stuffing it into you.
But in that kind of scarcity scenario you presumably actually want to gain weight and then for you this whole post is obviously backwards.
Just eat as much as you can!
</p>
<p>
  And wait, you say, aren&#8217;t kids trying to gain weight?
Kind of!
Mostly this doesn&#8217;t matter for kids when they&#8217;re kids.
It&#8217;s when they grow up that the Dirty Plate Club habit may help them.
Assuming they&#8217;re growing up in, say, America.
I personally kind of wish I hadn&#8217;t been raised to have a strong compulsion to clean my plate.
</p>
<p>
  I realize an exhortation to throw food away may sound pretty offensive to those outside the first world.
But it can&#8217;t be more offensive than witnessing America&#8217;s obesity epidemic.
Just like my original point about waistfulness, seeing Americans squander resources by overeating, and what that does to us, can only be a bigger slap in the face.
(Also, not cleaning your plate hopefully means saving the leftovers, not literally chucking them.)
</p>
<p>
  In theory you can achieve the same effect more efficiently by serving yourself slightly less than you feel like eating.
(Actually, go ahead and do that too!)
But that&#8217;s hard to predict and doesn&#8217;t break the habit of eating on autopilot when you happen to have too much food in front of you.
</p>
<h3>
  Wouldn&#8217;t You Just&#8230;
</h3>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;That would be a premeditated sin, which you&#8217;re far less susceptible to succumbing to than the sin of inattentiveness&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  I know what you&#8217;re thinking (because multiple people who read drafts of this had the same immediate reaction).
You&#8217;re worried you&#8217;d totally thwart this system by loading your plate extra full so you&#8217;d have plenty to throw out.
I don&#8217;t think you would do that!
That would be a premeditated

  </a>
  , 
which you&#8217;re far less susceptible to succumbing to than the sin of inattentiveness.
The latter happens without you even thinking about it.
</p>
<p>
  Overloading your plate is what I call a loophole you can drive an ice cream truck through.
Namely, yes, it&#8217;s a way you could utterly defeat the point of the system, but you won&#8217;t do that because you want the system to work.
The original example of such a loophole was from the first incarnation of the
  <a
    href=\\"http://beeminder.com/contract\\"
    title=\\"This is pretty out of date and not as relevant to current Beeminder\\"
  >
    Beeminder commitment contract
  </a>
  , back when we thought we needed an elaborate, literal commitment contract.
We suggested that, to avoid fuzziness around the definition of &#8220;going to the gym&#8221;, you could simply beemind touching the door of your gym&#8217;s building.
If you were legitimately injured or something and shouldn&#8217;t exercise, the loophole would be there for the taking.
But otherwise you&#8217;d never be so lazy that you&#8217;d actually get yourself all the way to the door of the gym and then not go in.
Maybe some people would be that lazy, but that&#8217;s the point: You know yourself at least to some extent.
Would you overload your plate so you could join the Dirty Plate Club while still stuffing yourself?
</p>
<h3>
  Empiricism
</h3>
<p>
  I&#8217;ve been trying this system for a few days and here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve settled on so far:
No changes in how much I serve myself, and the amount I leave 
(which, predictably, it&#8217;s taking plenty of effort to remember to leave anything at all) 
is a truly token amount, less than a full bite size.
I may have rendered the whole idea toothless that way but I&#8217;m hopeful that the added awareness alone will have value.
Or at least when I eventually find myself not actually liking what someone slaved over a hot stove to make for me, I&#8217;ll have perfect plausible deniability for not finishing it.
</p>
<p>
  But in all seriousness, I think I&#8217;ve convinced myself that as stupid as &#8220;throw more food away&#8221; sounds, this is actually a good idea.
So at your next meal, think of the poor sedentary children in America and let some perfectly good food go to waste.

  Failing to live a healthy lifestyle is or would be, for most of us, a classic failure of rationality &#8212; not acting in our own overall best interests.
There certainly are people (including the terminally ill, but others as well) who are exceptions, for whom an unhealthy lifestyle is rational.
For example, if you derive enough pleasure from smoking cigarettes that it&#8217;s worth the probable lost years of life, then that&#8217;s totally fine.
We&#8217;re quite serious. It&#8217;s up to the individual to decide these trade-offs.
We&#8217;re just talking about those people who explicitly say (and mean) that some of their behavior is not in their own best interest yet continue to engage in that behavior.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;Suppose that behavioral economists are wrong and orthodox economists are right: actions reveal preferences.&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  Not everyone suffers this common failure of rationality.
Those lucky people often suspect that the rest of us are actually just deluding ourselves.
What we
  <em>
    really
  </em>
  want is revealed by our actions.
A perfectly logically coherent stance! 
But there&#8217;s a mountain of evidence (particularly in the behavioral economics literature) that it&#8217;s not true.
Suppose, though, that the behavioral economists are wrong and the

  >
    orthodox economists
  </a>
  are right: 
actions reveal preferences and protestations otherwise are self-delusion. 
Then tools like
  <a
    href=\\"http://beeminder.com\\"

  >
    Beeminder
  </a>
  or
  <a href=\\"http://stickk.com\\">
    StickK
  </a>
  are letting you force yourself to do what you only
  <em>
    think
  </em>
  you want to.
Such tools will only serve to disabuse us rational-all-along-and-never-knew-it types of our delusions.
</p>
<p>
  Or we might cling to our delusions, making ourselves miserable indefinitely, you might argue.
Ha! Nice try. 
By the doctrine of revealed preferences, if we persist in using Beeminder to force ourselves to do something then we must genuinely prefer to do so.
Since February of 2008, when Beeminder started (under the name &#8220;
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/beenamer\\">
    Kibotzer
  </a>
  &#8221;) as a side project to help friends and family (and ourselves), people have persisted in using Beeminder.
So we can conclude that this failure of rationality, called
  <a href=\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akrasia\\">
    akrasia
  </a>
  , is real.
It may just be a failure of self-perception in many cases, but for some us, for at least some aspects of our lives, it&#8217;s a genuine failure of rationality.
</p>
<p>
  So how can we tell the self-delusion from the failure to do what we genuinely want to do?
</p>
<h3>
  The Want-Can-Will Test

<p>
  Consider some goal you have, such as losing a certain amount of weight or spending a certain minimum amount of time playing music.
Now consider three questions about it.

  <li>
    How certain are you that you
    <em>
      want
    </em>
    to do this?

  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  If your answers are &#8220;absolutely&#8221;, &#8220;definitely&#8221;, and &#8220;given historical evidence, not entirely&#8221; then you have your answer.

Today I want to explain my favorite thing about this feature: setting up Beeminder waterfalls.
I&#8217;ll explain that momentarily.

  &#8221;:

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Veritable Paradigm Shift?
I know, can we get over ourselves?
The reason we&#8217;re so excited about this though, is that we view it as a big step closer to the holy grail of Beeminder as nannybot that tells you minute-by-minute what you should be doing.
You can have deadlines staggered throughout the day so you&#8217;re satisfying the beest hour by hour all day long instead of screwing around all day and flying into a frenzy of productivity as midnight bears down.
It&#8217;s the same problem Beeminder solves so beautifully at a larger timescale &#8212; forcing you to make progress day by day on long-term goals &#8212; now on a smaller timescale.

  took that to heart and 
coined the term &#8220;Beeminder waterfall&#8221; to refer to a cascade of Beeminder deadlines that are scheduled to happen one after the other.
As Nick put it: &#8220;Waterfalls help you program your auto pilot. You build a rhythm and flow.&#8221;
He suggests small goals to start the day and then build to challenging ones.
And exercise at the start of the waterfall may energize you for intellectually challenging goals later in the day.
</p>
<p>
  Since we&#8217;re slower on the uptake, even for taking up our own advice, Bee and I didn&#8217;t properly set this up until last month, when we made a huge grid on a whiteboard 
(actually it was our dining room window &#8212; we often use windows as whiteboards) 
with a post-it note for each of our Beeminder goals.
Then we shuffled them around until we had a schedule that looked reasonable.

  by noon.
Et cetera.
</p>
<p>
  Last month that required an obnoxious number of clicks, once you&#8217;d chosen the waterfall schedule, to actually set up.
But now that reminder settings are revamped, you can do it all on one page, setting reminder start times and deadlines for all of your goals.
Hooray!

  Beeminder is a tool for my lucid self, the one that knows it&#8217;ll take regular effort to get to a substantially different future.
But the self that sets up the commitment contract isn&#8217;t the same self that needs to follow through.
The self that books a personal trainer for 6am isn&#8217;t the same self that drags his butt out of bed.
</p>
<p>
  Beeminder&#8217;s
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/flexbind\\">
    akrasia horizon
  </a>
  helps tremendously with this, so long as I&#8217;m somewhere on the road.
My lucid (or stressed) self can change the difficulty, but only starting some way into the future.
It&#8217;s like committing in advance to put aside a portion of bonuses and salary increases.
Future sacrifice sounds cheap, especially if it&#8217;s a slice of a bigger pie.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;Re-committing to a goal should be a joyous and positive step; it means that the goal is valuable even if the path to it is hard.&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  Where Beeminder can&#8217;t help (yet!) is when I don&#8217;t just fall off the wagon, but send it careening off the yellow brick road and into the ditch of despair.
My trouble is that the self who drives off the road might not be in a lucid enough state to commit to trying again.
And if I don&#8217;t re-commit promptly, I&#8217;m in danger of failing to do it at all. Ever.
The longer I avoid restarting work on my goal, the easier it becomes to keep avoiding it.
The spectre of formally admitting failure grows rather than shrinks.
Eventually I&#8217;ll ignore not just that one goal, but the whole pile of them that Beeminder tracks.
And that would be a disaster for my &#8220;substantially different future&#8221;.
</p>
<p>
  Here&#8217;s the nub of it:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Driving off the road is just a blip.
  </li>
  <li>
    Failure is abandoning the goal.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  But that&#8217;s not how Beeminder makes it feel right now.
To unfreeze your road is to formally admit that you failed to stay on it.
Re-committing to a goal should be a joyous and positive step; it means that the goal is valuable even if the path to it is hard.
</p>
<p>
  Beeminder&#8217;s current (May 2012) interface reinforces the feeling of failure during a reset.
Instead of showing a brief discontinuity on the graph, my entire history of good driving is relegated to another tab.
It feels like starting over, instead of continuing a successful journey.
I wonder what it would feel like if the history graph was the one shown on the front page, or if my recent history were to be re-cast with rose-coloured optimism.
</p>
<h2>
  A Bit of a Push
</h2>
<p>
  There are a couple of things that would help make it feel like I&#8217;m building on success rather than admitting failure.
One is to re-commit as soon as I&#8217;m psychologically able.
The second is to re-commit to an easily achievable slope, not a flat line.
Flatlining is bad; the goal isn&#8217;t dead.
What I need after losing momentum is a bit of a push.
</p>
<p>
  I need encouragement to reduce the length of time between going off the road and re-committing to the goal.
So I asked Daniel and Bethany to help me out.
Here&#8217;s my fine print:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    If I fall off this road I will give the nice folks at Beeminder an extra $50 if I don&#8217;t reinstate it within 48 hours of receiving the off-the-road email, plus $10 per day delay. Alternatively I can walk away for $100.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  That was surprisingly hard to write, which is why it&#8217;s got some pretty weaselly wording.
I didn&#8217;t want to trigger the initial payment by accident, so 48 hours instead of a day, and there&#8217;s a zero-cost path that still lets me sulk for a couple of days.
And that $100 clause caps my losses, in case I really go MIA.
</p>
<p>
  Despite what I wrote earlier about abandoning the goal being failure, that&#8217;s only true if it&#8217;s done in the moment, thoughtlessly and reactively.
My fine print allows me to throw up my hands and walk away for a price, and that price is high enough to make me seriously consider the value of my goal.
When I fall off the road, as hard as it might be to start up again, I want it to be my decision to re-commit, and as positive an experience as we can create.
</p>
<h2>
  Economics and Flow Control
</h2>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;I need to be gently encouraged  to do what I&#8217;ve already decided is the right thing.&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  While I&#8217;m on the
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/roadwidth\\">
    yellow brick road
  </a>
  , Beeminder lets me take a pause or slow down, subject to the
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/dial\\">
    akrasia horizon
  </a>
  delay.
I can immediately stop work and simply fall off the road; there&#8217;s a defined cost to shortening the horizon.
What&#8217;s missing is an incentivising cost to influence the length of time before I decide to either positively re-commit to my goal, or to abandon it.
Hence my fine print.
</p>
<p>
  I will already have paid my pledge for falling off the road, and in re-committing will be obliged to re-pledge a higher amount.
What the incentive clause does is gently encourage me to do what I&#8217;ve already decided is the right thing.
</p>
<p>
  It&#8217;s important that I have control over the length of time that passes before I decide.
If I know that I want a week&#8217;s respite, I can re-commit immediately to a flat start and a post-akrasian slope.
If I don&#8217;t want to even think about thinking about it for a week, that&#8217;s got a defined cost.
And it&#8217;s a cost that slowly and gently increases, nudging me toward making a decision.
</p>
<h2>
  Weasely Weasels
</h2>
<p>
  Nudging is important.
Gentle nudging.
Nudging is important because of my inner weasel, the one that mustn&#8217;t get loose.
</p>
<p>
  Daniel said to me recently that there are three levels of weaseliness.
Out-and-out weasels would falsify their data to avoid the consequences of a commitment contract.
Second-degree weasels intellectually accept the consequences but would never get around to implementing them.
And of course level zero weasels are not weasels at all but paragons of honor and conscientiousness.
Most of us Beeminders are the second type, weasels of omission.
</p>
<p>
  Me, I think I&#8217;m all three kinds of weasel. 
It depends on the context.
That&#8217;s why my anti-procrastination systems need to be gentle.
The more obligation that gets heaped on, the weaselier my weasel gets.
</p>
<p>
  I know that as soon as I report a made-up number to Beeminder &#8216;just this once&#8217;, I&#8217;m doomed.
This is especially true of numbers that are subjective.
Counting doughnuts is one thing, determining whether this was an hour of time well spent is another.
</p>
<p>
  Beeminder needs to support me in keeping my weaseliness at bay.
It needs to encourage me to stay on the road without being too scary, and it needs to make getting back on the wagon an experience that no weasel could object to.
For my part, I need to set goals that I care about, few in number, with manageable slopes, and report truthfully my progress against them.
Between us, I&#8217;m confident that I will achieve my substantially different future.

  Beeple of the world want to take their weekends off, and for a long time the best answer we&#8217;ve had is 
&#8220;well, if you just make sure to get green by Friday night, then you can safely take Saturday and Sunday off&#8221;, 
which is highly unsatisfying to the truly akratic. 
Because if I had the discipline to &#8220;just get green by Friday&#8221; how badly would I really need Beeminder&#8217;s nudge in the first place? 
And so for years I&#8217;ve been having good intentions to get enough work done to take the weekend off, and then wound up with at least a few hours of work each day of my so-called rest time.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;With a Plan Bee or higher subscription you can tick a checkbox in your goal&#8217;s settings and we&#8217;ll schedule next week&#8217;s break for you every Friday.&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  Until about half a year ago when I started scheduling breaks for myself every Friday. 
Which has been working pretty great, but I&#8217;d still forget sometimes, and then I wouldn&#8217;t have my weekend and I&#8217;d feel pretty bent out of shape. 
So I finally started a Beeminder goal that&#8217;s due every Friday that reminds me to schedule breaks. 
Now that I have an unforgettable reminder, I&#8217;ve had nice relaxed weekends most weeks, and it&#8217;s been pretty good for my mental health, I think.
</p>
<p>
  Anyhow, so now we&#8217;re automating this. 
With a Plan Bee or higher subscription you can tick a checkbox in your goal&#8217;s settings and we&#8217;ll schedule next week&#8217;s break for you every Friday.
</p>
<h3>
  Do More
</h3>
<p>
  For your Do More goals we&#8217;ll put in a flat spot over Saturday and Sunday. 
You may find it helpful to switch your goal over to daily rate units if you&#8217;re using this feature. 
A goal set to 40hrs/week is equivalent to only 5.7 hours per day, so if you have your goal set to 40 hours/week, with weekends scheduled in this way, you only have to complete 28.5 hours each week to stay on track.
</p>
<h3>
  Do Less
</h3>
<p>
  For your Do Less goals we also ask for the amount of buffer you want on the weekend, and then we schedule a jump on Saturday to give you that much extra buffer. 
The buffer is the total amount for the weekend, not in terms of your rate units. 
We also skip
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/less\\"
    title=\\"Blog post about PPRs, as we call them\\"
  >
    pessimistic presumptive reports
  </a>
  for the weekend. 
We do it like this for Do Less because, imagine you&#8217;re tracking your passive entertainment / TV watching time. 
You may want to watch no TV during the work week, but then on the weekend, you want to watch as much TV as you please. 
This allows you to do that.
</p>
<h3>
  Additional Caveats
</h3>
<p>
  We also stop autoratcheting (another premium feature) for the weekend, so that you don&#8217;t allow yourself a buffer and then scooch it away. 
However, because of the way that Do More ratcheting works, where it winds up shifting the dates of future road segments, ratcheting is not recommended for Do More goals with weekends scheduled.
</p>
<p>
  Now, this method of scheduling the breaks ahead of time is not foolproof, because you could go over your allowed weekend buffer with a Do Less, or you could forget and ratchet a Do More goal and wind up shifting the weekend for some reason, so we also 
have a failsafe that (for now) calls in us humans to the rescue if you manage to derail a goal on a Saturday or Sunday while weekends-off is checked.
In short, we&#8217;re guaranteeing that you won&#8217;t!

<h2>
  Why Weigh?
</h2>
<p>
  If you&#8217;re fitness savvy you know you should be gaining muscle as you lose fat.
So isn&#8217;t focusing on body weight silly, since muscle is denser than fat and ultimately we all want to be svelte and strong and lean, like a jungle cat? 
Maybe you have a fancy scale that tells you what really matters: percent body fat.
</p>
<p>
  Unfortunately, estimating body fat from those electrical impedance devices is hardly better than a random number generator. 
They tell you something plausible only by factoring in your weight, height, sex, and age.
Change any of these values and your body fat percentage on the scale magically changes.

This is definitely true if you&#8217;re well outside your ideal weight range.
Say you&#8217;re over a third body fat.
Then you surely want your scale weight to go down as a side effect of losing the body fat, unless you also want to add bodybuilder levels of new muscle.

  As long as your scale weight is right now definitely more than what it&#8217;s going to be when you&#8217;re at your ideal body composition then it&#8217;s a good metric to track.
In other words, beemind down to an upper bound on your ideal weight. 
At that point you can switch to a truer but noisier or less convenient metric.

  Of course scale weight itself is a noisy metric, but not so noisy that it isn&#8217;t overcome by getting more data, which is the point of the rest of this article.

<h2>
  Why Weigh Daily?
</h2>
<p>
  A single measurement of our weight is like a single photograph of our looks.
You&#8217;re more photogenic when you&#8217;re laughing, for example, or sometimes the lighting or photographer is just better or worse.
How would you react if you saw 149 on the scale and then a week later 150, even though you went to the gym more than usual?
Would you throw your hands up, eat all the junk food in the house, and gear up for a better plan starting Monday?
No!
Maybe dinner the night before was a little larger than normal, or you drank a lot of water, 
or maybe you just haven&#8217;t emptied your bowels recently enough! 
In fact, one of our beeminders (UPDATE: it was
  <a href=\\"http://robfelty.com\\">
    Rob Felty
  </a>
  , who assures us he doesn&#8217;t mind being quoted even when it&#8217;s about poop) recently commented:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Weighing daily has been crucial for me.
I realized that I sometimes fluctuated 1-2 pounds in one day, maybe just because I hadn&#8217;t pooped.
If I only weighed myself once a week, I could easily attribute that fluctuation to real weight gain or loss.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  These normal fluctuations in weight have nothing to do with whether you may have made progress that week.

  </a>
  Since weight isn&#8217;t a fixed number, sampling it only once a week doesn&#8217;t give you good information on which direction it&#8217;s going or how quickly, and you don&#8217;t learn much about your natural weight range.
On shows like
  <em>
    The Biggest Loser
  </em>
  they weigh weekly, but that&#8217;s a game &#8212; they&#8217;re just trying to make good TV.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;More information is good&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  There&#8217;s an established correlation between weighing more frequently and losing more weight / maintaining a healthy weight.
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"STU1\\"
    href=\\"#STU\\"
  >
    [4]
  </a>
  More information is good!
For example, you can more quickly reverse a trend in the wrong direction.
If you are scared to look at your weight for fear that you won&#8217;t like what you see, it becomes easier to not feel accountable for your actions.
It&#8217;s a slippery slope once what you do right now doesn&#8217;t matter.
You&#8217;ll be &#8220;good&#8221; when you start a new plan, soon, so it&#8217;s okay to be &#8220;bad&#8221; right now.
Sound familiar?
It&#8217;s a diet mentality and it doesn&#8217;t lend itself to achieving a balanced life, or maintaining a healthy weight and habits.
People who achieve and maintain a healthy weight miss workouts sometimes and eat dessert or too many chips sometimes and it&#8217;s not bad, it&#8217;s part of life.
Another beeminder put it this way:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    I like that it motivates me to think in the short term about a long-term goal.
Previously I avoided weighing myself frequently because I was too scared to see those day-to-day fluctuations,
but I&#8217;m coming to the realization that those small fluctuations are what combine to make a difference &#8212; one way or the other.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  I personally made this same shift once I started using Beeminder.
It puts meaning to the daily fluctuating numbers.
</p>
<p>
  Daily weighing can completely shift your focus.
Note that I&#8217;m not advocating a
  <em>
    focus
  </em>
  on daily weight, but simply weighing daily in order to focus on what&#8217;s really happening.
It takes a lot of trees to make a forest, and a Beeminder graph shows this very nicely.
You can stop treating your weight loss as a Big Thing to deal with from date X to date Y while gearing up to follow a strict plan where deviating from it will throw you off the wagon, into the kitchen, and back to your Sunday night willpower-mustering.
Instead, you begin to focus on each day for what it is: life, part of a journey, and a process.
Will you sometimes miss workouts or overeat during that process? Of course!
Your simple, attainable goal of being on track tomorrow, even with mistakes, becomes much more action oriented, short term, and therefore doable.
Do
  <em>
    something
  </em>
  every day without letting a mistake derail you and pretty soon you&#8217;ve gotten somewhere!
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;What you do today matters because you have a yellow brick road to be on tomorrow&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  If you&#8217;ve spent a lifetime in the diet mentality, it&#8217;s not an easy thing to shift from.
Weighing today at 199 and tomorrow at 201 messes with your head
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"TIP1\\"
    href=\\"#TIP\\"
  >
    [5]
  </a>
  even though you logically know you couldn&#8217;t
  <em>
    possibly
  </em>
  have gained two pounds in a day (you&#8217;d have to eat an
  <em>
    excess
  </em>
  of 7,000 calories
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"CAL1\\"
    href=\\"#CAL\\"
  >
    [6]
  </a>
  to accomplish that!).
Weighing daily with the feedback of a Beeminder graph is a great way to shift out of that mentality.
You&#8217;ll find you still have to fight to change your thinking in the beginning.
With the actual number staring you in the face from the scale, you have a choice to make.
You can let yourself believe that you&#8217;ve gained weight and therefore failed and need to start over with a new and better plan.
Or, you can go look at your weight graph, see that you&#8217;re still on the road and take on the new day with the motivation to still be on track tomorrow.
Work out a little harder, be a little more conscious of your food intake, get plenty of sleep (a great metabolism boost), and remind yourself repeatedly that you&#8217;re on track to your goal.
You&#8217;re in the process of losing weight and what you do today matters because you have a yellow brick road to be on tomorrow.
Drilling those positive thoughts into your head will keep you from dissolving into past habits, or dwelling on frustration or defeat.
The next day, when your weight is (likely) back down a bit, you can enjoy the easy-to-come-by motivation, fostering yet another good day.
The positive reinforcement from being a little more diligent the day before makes you want to do it again!
If your weight then bounces up a bit again on another day, drill those positive thoughts into your head.
Look at your graph to see that you are indeed moving in the right direction overall, and pretty soon the mental shift will happen and you will get over the hurdle that has held you back for so long.

    Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I&#8217;m very much in favor of muscle building and recommend weight training as part of any fitness plan.
Besides, muscle burns calories just sitting there, so it&#8217;s a huge help for weight loss, i.e., fat loss.
Losing weight by just eating less can often be a death spiral where you have to keep eating less and less as your metabolism adapts to the fewer calories. 
The human body is impressively adept at maintaining its weight.

    Speaking of which, another thing we recommend is having occasional

If it&#8217;s hard to keep from gaining, let alone losing, then you&#8217;re doing it wrong.

    Beeminder is agnostic about what metric you use to measure your progress, though the simpler it is to measure the better. 
And we&#8217;ve put thought into the case of scale weight as a metric, figuring out
    <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/roadwidth\\">
      how to adjust for random fluctuations
    </a>
    , and how to avoid losing weight the wrong way.
But for most people that still means a gradually decreasing scale weight so we stand by it as a useful metric.

    Pro tip: As recommended by PhysicsDiet.com [UPDATE: The link to physicsdiet.com/WhenShouldIWeighMyself.aspx died. Sad face.], another site inspired by The Hacker&#8217;s Diet, you can further reduce the noise in your weight measurements by consistently weighing first thing in the morning, after using the bathroom but before eating or drinking anything.

    Another pro tip: If you&#8217;re really struggling, try switching the units on your scale (kilograms, pounds, stone). Whomp! 
Suddenly your scale is speaking gibberish (unless you&#8217;re really good at mental math), and you can just compare the numbers to previous days, instead of to your entire mental history of your weight and body issues.

  I&#8217;ve been thinking about beeminding weight loss a lot lately and the thing is, beeminding weight loss sucks!
But not any more than losing weight in general sucks.
</p>
<p>
  Even for people who really like the whole commitment device craziness, Beeminder sometimes feels aversive. 
I believe that happens when you don&#8217;t feel like you are fully in control of whether or not you derail. 
For weight loss you rarely come to a clear decision point where you are choosing between paying your pledge and being on your yellow brick road. 
Instead it is a constant stream of little decisions. 
&#8220;Is it worth $90 to eat this second helping? No, but

<p>
  But when you are beeminding weight it&#8217;s not always clear what it will take. 
Will peeing put me under the line? 
Will a 20 minute walk before breakfast do it?
Will it take an entire day of fasting? 
If you&#8217;ve never fasted before that might be a terrifying prospect &#8212; and it&#8217;s not even safe for everyone.

  When you are not in control, Beeminder can feel punitive or even antagonistic. 
Though I contend it&#8217;s no worse than
  <em>
    not
  </em>
  using Beeminder to lose weight. 
The things you need to do to successfully beemind your weight are all things you would do to lose weight regardless of whether or not you are entering those weights on Beeminder.
</p>
<p>
  Put another way, in order to successfully beemind your weight, you need to actually lose weight. 
So let Beeminder be your safety net.
At the very least set up a Beeminder road that stays perfectly flat from your current weight and commit to not gaining weight from here on out.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, doing the following things will help you stay on your road, and lose weight in the long run.
</p>
<h2>
  1. Be realistic
</h2>
<p>
  If you set your road too steep, you are going to derail. 
Our Resident Fitness Expert, Melanie, recommends a maximum rate of 1% of your body weight per week. 
For example, if you are starting at 250 pounds then you could safely lose up to 2.5 pounds per week to begin with. 
Note that 1% is extremely difficult to maintain for an extended period of time and requires constant vigilance and likely feeling hungry most of the time.
Smaller, incremental changes to your lifestyle are more likely to be maintainable over the long run.
</p>
<h2>
  2. Weigh in every day
</h2>
<p>
  For real. First thing in the morning after you&#8217;ve used the bathroom, to minimize variance. 
We
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/weighly\\"
    title=\\"&#39;Why Weigh (Daily)?&#39;\\"
  >
    devoted an entire post to this once
  </a>
  , so I&#8217;ll leave it at that.
</p>
<h2>
  3. Have a backup plan for an eep day
</h2>
<p>
  For example: &#8220;If I am ever in the red on my weight road, then at lunchtime I will
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/vegetables\\"
    title=\\"Carrots are delicious\\"
  >
    eat a carrot
  </a>
  and go for a walk.&#8221;
Take a minute to think through your morning routine and imagine what you&#8217;d be willing and able to do if you weighed in and your dot was red. 
Then say it out loud, or write it down in if-then format.
  <a

</p>
<p>
  Our esteemed cofounder, Danny, 
once told the story of weighing in 0.75 kg above his weight road and how he proceeded to spend an hour and a half doing burpees and weighted pushups and running in circles around the block until he was back on.
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"
    id=\\"WGH1\\"
    href=\\"#WGH\\"
  >
    [4]
  </a>
  In other words, he did some exercise. 
Fancy that! Exactly what he should have been doing to lose weight in the first place.
</p>
<h2>
  4. Keep an eye on the purple moving average line
</h2>
<p>
  If your weight is on the yellow brick road, then yes, you&#8217;re probably on track toward your goal, but the road is pretty wide to accomodate the variance in your data, and sometimes it can be hard to see the forest for the trees. 
The purple moving average line is nice for checking your trend. 
If your weight today is above the moving average you&#8217;re pulling it up; if your weight is below you&#8217;re pulling it down.
If you are trying to lose weight you want your datapoints mostly below the moving average line.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    Corollary to 4: If the moving average is on a collision course with the centerline of your yellow brick road, your road is probably too steep.
  </strong>
</p>
<h2>
  5. Beemind related goals
</h2>
<p>
  Finally, beemind other things that contribute to weight loss and
  <em>
    are
  </em>
  under your direct control. 
Even if you can&#8217;t get yourself into a non-antagonistic mindset over the money pledged on a weight loss goal, you can still use Beeminder to help you lose weight. 
Commit to getting 60 minutes of exercise a week. 
Walking every day. 
Less eating out. 
Eating
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/vegetables\\"
    title=\\"Previous blog post ranting about salad\\"
  >
    vegetables
  </a>
  . 
Intermittent fasting twice a week.
These things will start to contribute to some weight loss. 
And maybe, if we are really lucky, maybe you can fall in love with Beeminder and we will eventually get our meat-hooks into your weight loss roads again (

Apparently Bethany is slap-happy. We won&#8217;t say that in the actual post.

  The stack is Ubuntu / Nginx / Passenger / Mongo / Rails on a

We use
  <a href=\\"https://github.com/defunkt/resque/\\">

  </a>
  for asynchronous and delayed jobs, so we&#8217;ve got
  <a href=\\"http://redis.io/\\">
    Redis

Our graphs have been generated in Mathematica, but we&#8217;ve recently ported to Python&#8217;s

  </a>
  for now.
We&#8217;re thinking
  <a href=\\"http://d3js.org\\">
    d3.js

  is the future.
Our current graph generator, BeeBrain, is a ridiculous frankenstein with its own API that involves &#8212; we kid you not &#8212; a PHP script that our Ruby code makes GET requests to which get queued up by a Perl script, which then calls Mathematica-cum-Python to make the graph images and compute other statistics about the goals.

  What software do you use to run your business?

<p>
  For internal communication and planning we use our own instance of
  <a href=\\"https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite\\">
    Etherpad
  </a>
  for pretty much everything from to-do lists to web page copy to writing this post right now.
(Truly realtime collaborative editing can sometimes go slightly awry; see, for example, the turtles paragraph above.)
Our blog is hosted on
  <a href=\\"http://wpengine.com\\">
    WPEngine

And we were hating the WordPress editor for so many reasons, not least of which that it does not make collaboration on blog posts as sublime as we expect from all text editing experiences since we first set eyes on Etherpad. So we wrote a plugin to jam Etherpad up into WordPress’s hoohah. Throw in some nice markdown as well and you have sexy times in WordPress’s backend.\\"

  We&#8217;re also pretty big fans of post-it note technology and have been trying out

We communicate with each other with

It&#8217;s nice in that it&#8217;s just google chat so non-nerds can pop in as needed, unlike, say, IRC-based solutions.

<p>
  We farm out heavy lifting to various other services where we can. 
For payments,
  <a href=\\"http://stripe.com\\">
    Stripe
  </a>
  , of course.
We want to have Stripe&#8217;s babies. 
(We know,
  <a href=\\"http://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/08/06/stripe-and-ab-testing-made-me-a-small-fortune/\\">
    get in line
  </a>
  ; we&#8217;ve totally been using them since their &#8220;DevPayments&#8221; days though!)
We also give users the option of
  <a href=\\"http://chirpify.com\\">
    Chirpify
  </a>
  for payments.
Pay by tweeting! You can actually authorize us to make the tweet that effects the payment so that you not only get charged for derailing from your yellow brick road, we can publicly humiliate you as well.
</p>
<p>
  A big part of Beeminder &#8212; unless you&#8217;ve hooked up a fancy gadget to automate the data entry &#8212; is our nosy robot that asks you every day for your number.
You can reply by email or SMS, for which we use
  <a href=\\"http://www.mailgun.com/\\">
    Mailgun
  </a>
  and
  <a href=\\"http://twilio.com\\">
    Twilio
  </a>
  , respectively.
We highly recommend Mailgun over Sendgrid or Postmark or others.
It does everything those services do and much more &#8212; particularly if you want to parse incoming email and handle it in your app.
Mailgun&#8217;s API makes that a joy.
</p>
<p>
  Our solution to CRM and talking to the customers is thin.
We mostly just use Gmail.
  <a href=\\"http://www.streak.com/\\">
    Streak
  </a>
  helps out a bit &#8212; we especially like their email snippets. 
We have a lot of semi-automated life-cycle and even event-driven emails where we still use a human to review and hit send.
We also have custom email snoozing, based on
  <a href=\\"http://lifehacker.com/5825634/how-to-add-a-snooze-button-to-gmail\\">
    an idea from Lifehacker
  </a>
  , implemented using
  <a href=\\"https://developers.google.com/apps-script/\\">
    Google Apps Script
  </a>
  .
[UPDATE 2013: Dreeves packaged it up as

If you don&#8217;t want to go down that rabbit hole, we also recommend

Some of our support takes place on

    our user feedback forum
  </a>
  , which is thanks to
  <a href=\\"http://uservoice.com\\">

</p>
<p>
  One other necessary ingredient for doing customer support in email is
  <a href=\\"http://rapportive.com\\">
    Rapportive
  </a>
  .
Rapportive has a wonderful API for making custom widgets.
It was very easy to make a custom Rapportive widget so that when a customer emails us we see a summary in the sidebar about all their beeminding (and whether they actually pay us).
</p>
<p>
  Finally, one of the most important things we use to run our business is this
  <a href=\\"http://beeminder.com\\">
    amazing app called Beeminder
  </a>
  . 
We track our hours spent on task,
  <a href=\\"http://beeminder.com/meta/blog\\">
    our blog posts
  </a>
  , and it keeps us
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/uvi\\">
    hard committed (to the tune of $1000)
  </a>
  to making
  <a href=\\"https://www.beeminder.com/meta/uvi\\">
    user-visible improvements
  </a>
  to the product every single day.
It&#8217;s no joke that Beeminder wouldn&#8217;t exist right now if it weren&#8217;t for our meta Beeminder goals forcing us to stick it out during the dips in the rollercoaster ride that is startupland.

  He points out that the most amazing people he knows tend not to just have goals that they achieve and then are done with, but systems for constantly improving.
This is the biggest difference between Beeminder and
  <a
    href=\\"http://stickk.com\\"
    title=\\"Put a contract out on yourself\\"

StickK is about reaching a goal and the key question for setting up a goal in StickK is defining the success criteria.
With Beeminder the key question for setting up a goal is defining a

  If you want to be a writer you could beemind time spent writing, or number of pages, or number of words, or stories finished, or articles published. 
How do you pick which one to actually beemind?
</p>
<h3>
  1. Prefer things you can automate
</h3>
<p>
  E.g., time spent as measured by
  <a
    href=\\"http://rescuetime.com\\"
    title=\\"RescueTime + Beeminder ~ Milk + Honey. Delicious on their own. Better together.\\"

<h3>
  2. Prefer things that make inherently interesting graphs
</h3>
<p>
  We call it the
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/qs2013/\\"
    title=\\"QS = Quantified Self\\"
  >
    QS
  </a>
  First principle, and in fact I view Beeminder as foremost a Quantified Self tool.
For example, beeminding miles run is more interesting than beeminding number of runs.
</p>
<h3>
  3. Prefer actions over outcomes
</h3>
<p>
  I.e., things you have direct control over. 
If you are setting a goal to &#8220;get tenure&#8221;, beemind the number of papers submitted for review rather than number of papers accepted for publication.
We also recommend
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/philip/\\"
    title=\\"Weight is an outcome, the result of eating better and exercising more\\"
  >
    beeminding calories and workouts over beeminding weight
  </a>
  (or at least beemind the latter very conservatively).
</p>
<p>
  P.S. We

  In fact, most Beeminder goals don&#8217;t have success criteria.
They&#8217;re things like 
&#8220;work out at least 3 times a week, forever&#8221; or
&#8220;spend an hour a day writing, forever&#8221; or
&#8220;keep my weight below 100 kilograms, forever&#8221;.

  We mostly use it for

  -based goals, where the data is added automatically.
For other goals we should probably add a text box for quickly adding data.

  For the past two weeks I&#8217;ve been trying a new system I&#8217;ve formulated to make all casual commitments be hard commitments. 
It&#8217;s similar to my
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/should\\"
    title=\\"Anti-resolution, as in, don&#39;t just resolve to do things, make them at least slightly more likely, right now. Recent epiphany: &#39;I need to...&#39; should be treated as equivalent to &#39;I should...&#39;\\"
  >
    Anti-Resolution Resolution
  </a>
  ,
which has worked well for me for years now.
I publicly committed to never musing that &#8220;I should&#8221; do something without taking at least some small action to make that thing more likely to actually happen.
</p>
<p>
  Now I&#8217;m trying something similar for &#8220;I will&#8221;.
Specifically, I can never just say, no matter how casually, &#8220;I&#8217;ll X the Y&#8221;.
(File the report, call the dentist, send the pictures, etc.)
I have to add consequences if the Y ends up un-X&#8217;d.
</p>
<p>
  I should admit that the Anti-Resolution Resolution has mostly just made me not say &#8220;I should&#8221; in the first place. 
It hasn&#8217;t been life-altering or anything. 
But it&#8217;s worthwhile in that I feel less guilty about not doing things I &#8220;should&#8221; do. 
At worst the &#8220;no consequence-free &#8216;I will&#8217;&#8221; system will be similar. 
But I predict it will be much better because of what it means for your relationships with people when you&#8217;re that conscientious.
So far it feels quite good.
</p>
<p>
  The pragmatic question was how to commit to consequences on the fly without bogging down everyday conversations.
My first ideas were 
putting tasks in
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/gtbee\\"
    title=\\"A to-do list iPhone app that charges you (via your Beeminder account, but otherwise doesn&#39;t use Beeminder) for not finishing tasks\\"
  >
    GTBee
  </a>
  , 
a Slack bot that mediates conversations, or 
a separate Google calendar for &#8220;I will&#8221; commitments that&#8217;s integrated with Beeminder somehow.
</p>
<p>
  But, by the
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/shirknturk\\"
    title=\\"Excessively short version: don&#39;t automate things until you have to\\"
  >
    Shirk &amp; Turk principle
  </a>
  ,
I&#8217;ve started with something I can do manually. 
Namely, whenever I make an &#8220;I will&#8221; statement 
(even the most casual &#8220;cool, I&#8217;ll take a look&#8221; type utterances) 
I explicitly also mention a deadline and put it on my calendar and on a Beeminder goal. 
It feels strange to enter datapoints in the future on Beeminder but it&#8217;s always been allowed.
I make the datapoint value be 0 until I actually do the thing, when I can change it to a 1.

    success rate
  </a>
  here, just that I keep 8 commitments per week.
But my success rate for my first 22 &#8220;I will&#8221; commitments has been essentially 100%.
I say essentially because the other day I was 10 minutes late on one of them.
Which might be a dangerously slippery slope because on the very next one I was 20 minutes late.
We&#8217;ll see!
</p>
<p>
  I&#8217;ll be sure to update this post to let you know if this system stands the test of time [dreev.es/will deadline = Oct 27 5pm].
</p>
<h2>
  Late Penalties
</h2>
<p>
  UPDATE after another 2 weeks:
I&#8217;m continuing to hone the system and it feels kind of amazing. 
I came up with a way to deal with the case of missing the deadline but still meeting the spirit of the commitment. 
The idea is to count it as partial success, so you can still compute an overall success rate. 
Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going with:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    by the deadline = 100% success = datapoint of 1 in Beeminder
  </li>
  <li>
    seconds late = close enough, w/in measurement error, still 1
  </li>
  <li>
    minutes late = .999 (baaasically counts)
  </li>
  <li>
    hours late = .99 (no big deal, almost fully counts)
  </li>
  <li>
    days late = .9 (hey, it got done, that was the main thing)
  </li>
  <li>
    weeks late = .5 (kind of half defeats the point to be this late)
  </li>
  <li>
    months late = .1 (mostly doesn&#8217;t count)
  </li>
  <li>
    years late = .01 (better late than never, barely)
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  So with 47 I-wills and counting, I&#8217;m holding steady at greater than 99.9% success.
</p>
<p>
  UPDATE 2017-10-27 5:11pm:
Going on 3 months, I&#8217;m still averaging 8 commitments per week, at 99.97% reliability.
(I&#8217;m some minutes late on my commitment above to make this update so I&#8217;m getting 99.9% credit for this!)
So I&#8217;m absolutely convinced this needs to be turned into a system anyone can use and I&#8217;m committed to finish implementing it in the next couple months!
(
  <a
    href=\\"http://dreev.commits.to/finish_implementing_this_system/by/january\\"

  >
    dreev.commits.to/finish_implementing_this_system/by/january
  </a>
  !)
Of course with over 100 commitments and counting, my overall reliability will still be over 99% even if fail to do that.
</p>
<p>
  UPDATE 2018-08-29:
It&#8217;s been over a year and I still love this.
I&#8217;ve now made 379 commitments and have an overall reliability of 97.25%.
We&#8217;re developing Commits.to, as it&#8217;s now called, very gradually and it&#8217;s still in private beta but feel free to get on the waitlist for when we eventually open it up.
(Or commit to contributing to the

    Ego Depletion Depletion
  </a>
  ,&#8221;
generated a lot of discussion and I found I was contradicting myself on the question of what willpower is exactly.
</p>
<p>
  First a recap, hopefully in plainer English, about what all the fuss is about.
</p>
<p>
  A big finding in psychology is that &#8220;willpower is like a muscle&#8221;. 
For example, exerting willpower to not eat pie for breakfast will &#8220;deplete your ego&#8221; and make it harder to resist watching youtube videos instead of working in the afternoon. 
That spawned lots of advice about picking your willpower battles in the course of a day. 
The willpower-as-muscle analogy also led to advice about building up the strength of your willpower by exercising it.
</p>
<p>
  All that advice was built on a lie. 
The evidence for it now appears to be bogus.
</p>
<p>
  This is a massively big deal for the whole field of psychology because Ego Depletion was a very well-established result &#8212; dozens of studies all agreeing &#8212; and if it&#8217;s wrong then can we really believe any results from the psychology literature? 
This is psychology&#8217;s replication crisis and to the field&#8217;s credit they&#8217;ve taken it dead seriously, like by launching the

  Donuts vs dessert

  .
&#8220;I can resist donuts at work in the morning much more easily than I can resist dessert after a long, stressful day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
  Well let me ask you this, partially hypothetical people: 
is it possible you simply value dessert more after a hard day than you do donuts in the morning?
That&#8217;s what Occam&#8217;s razor might suggest. 
No difference in willpower, just a difference in circumstances/preferences.
Maybe it makes sense to reward yourself after hard work, or to relax or indulge when you&#8217;re wiped out.

<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;Willpower = overcoming akrasia by pure introspection&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  Let&#8217;s define willpower as overcoming akrasia by pure introspection. 
If we agree on that definition then I have two different claims:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Willpower isn&#8217;t any more depletable than, say, ability to do mental arithmetic.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you align your short and long term preferences then no akrasia and no need for willpower.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  I&#8217;m not that wedded to #1. 
I think the donuts/dessert example is more elegantly explained by a simple reassessment of priorities in light of a hard day. 
But disagreements on #1 may be hair-splitting.
</p>
<p>
  Beeminder&#8217;s big claim is that it&#8217;s possible to route around willpower altogether.
</p>
<h3>
  No need for that hypothesis
</h3>
<p>
  Here&#8217;s what I mean when I say there&#8217;s no such thing as willpower, despite having just defined it.
Paraphrasing Laplace, I can explain all behavior simply in terms of responding to incentives.
You want this whole pie in your body right now, and also you want to be two sizes smaller by next summer. 
Conflicting preferences are normally no big deal. 
You just, y&#8217;know, weigh them, make your tradeoffs, and reach a decision. 
But when the preferences apply at different timescales (pie now, thinner later) humans suffer from a massive irrationality which philosophers call akrasia and economists call dynamic inconsistency and normal people call &#8230; being stupidly short-sighted, or in the case of time management: procrastination.
</p>
<p>
  Commitment devices are a way to change your own incentives so that willpower is a non-issue. 
They make your short-term and long-term incentives line up. 
There are many less drastic things you can do as well.
</p>
<h3>
  Does it take willpower to set up a Beeminder goal?
</h3>
<p>
  That may be

We often have these little bursts of motivation and the hard part is the follow through. 
So if you can seize on your next motivation burst to get a Beeminder goal set up then &#8212; if Beeminder works as advertised (and please, please 
talk to us 
if you feel it doesn&#8217;t!) &#8212; the follow-through will be in the bag.

  I came across this draft from 2010 or 2011, before we&#8217;d publicly launched and with just a smattering of beta users we&#8217;d recruited one by one.

I once saw an estimate of the total amount of money wasted because of irrational procrastination in tax filing. 
It was something astronomical &#8212; hundreds of millions of dollars? 
But that&#8217;s the cost of just one instance of akrasia on one day of the year, and only the monetary cost. 
The inefficiency from other instances of akrasia (like fitness and weight loss) can be measured in human lives.

I.e., the value I get out of being self-bound is in the thousands of dollars. 
I know, the psychology is ridiculous but it&#8217;s true: I could shrug off losing a thousand dollars on a Beeminder contract because I would feel like I still came out ahead. 
The self-binding I had up till I [derailed] would&#8217;ve been worth more than the thousand dollar cost. 
This is one of the tricky things about self-binding &#8212; making the stakes high enough. 
But the point is, the value an individual can get out of this is enormous.

    title=\\"National Novel Writing Month is abbreviated NaNoWriMo because writers are clever like that. Although it&#39;s clearly international, not national.\\"

    new official URLminder integration
  </a>
  .
Well it&#8217;s been several months now and that integration has come a long way.
So we wanted to both tell you about how much better it is and also give a fully newbee-friendly guide to beeminding your writing.
</p>
<p>
  We&#8217;ll start at the very beginning.
Beeminder helps you break a big, scary, far-off deadline &#8212; write a novel by the end of November, write a dissertation in four years, you name it &#8212; into a succession of daily deadlines.
To make the daily deadlines meaningful, you risk money.
You literally put in your credit card and agree to get charged any day that you fail to write enough.
Beeminder makes a graph of your progress and bugs you incessantly if you&#8217;re about to derail on your goal.
It&#8217;s all frighteningly motivating.
Many books and dissertations have been finished because of Beeminder!
</p>
<p>
  Now for the automatic word count part.
This works by you telling Beeminder a URL or list of URLs where your writing lives.
This doesn&#8217;t mean your writing needs to be public!
You just need to get a URL for it.
We&#8217;ll explain exactly how to do that below, whether your document lives on your own computer or an online editor like Google Docs.
</p>
<p>
  First, here&#8217;s the quick summary of what&#8217;s new:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    We magically fix the URLs that Google Docs and Dropbox give so we get the plain text version of your document and thus the true word counts
  </li>
  <li>
    We let you edit your list of URLs any time in your goal settings
  </li>
  <li>
    A new landing page
  </li>
</ol>

      title=\\"If you're reading this post then this landing page is a little superfluous. But it does include a nice nugget of wisdom for writers.\\"
    >
  </a>
</p>
<p>
  And here&#8217;s what you do to start beeminding your word count, starting with&#8230;
</p>
<h2>
  Google Docs
</h2>
<p>
  Google Docs is dirt simple to start writing with.
Head to
  <a
    href=\\"http://docs.google.com\\"
    title=\\"Or google Google Docs\\"
  >
    docs.google.com
  </a>
  ,
create a Google account if you don&#8217;t have one, click &#8220;new document&#8221;, and start writing.
</p>
<p>
  To tell Beeminder to mind your document, look for the blue Share button in the upper right:
</p>
<p>
  <img
    class=\\"aligncenter\\"
    src=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2017-04-03-at-23.34.49-e1491289049388.png\\"
    alt=\\"Google Docs: where to find 'share' button\\"
    title=\\"Blue share button, upper right. That's all you need to know.\\"
  >
</p>
<p>
  When you click that you&#8217;ll see an option in the bottom half under the header &#8220;Get link&#8221;.
That&#8217;s what you want &#8212; this will allow you to make shareable link. It doesn&#8217;t make your document public.

  .
</p>
<h2>
  Dropbox
</h2>
<p>
  If you don&#8217;t like Google Docs and like to keep your document on your own computer, we&#8217;ve still got you covered, thanks to
  <a
    href=\\"https://db.tt/7KbhrFK0\\"
    title=\\"Fancy referral link that supposedly gives you (and me) an extra 500MB of free space. That&#39;s many novels&#39; worth!\\"
  >
    Dropbox
  </a>
  .
Dropbox is a marvel of software engineering in how completely painless it is to set up and use.
If you&#8217;re just installing it so Beeminder can mind your document you&#8217;ll never have to interact with it again.
All you need to do is make sure that Dropbox is syncing the directory where your writing lives on your computer.
</p>
<p>
  Then you can head to Dropbox.com, log in, and find your document.
Look for the Share menu on the right.
Select &#8220;Share with Dropbox&#8221;.
</p>
<p>
  <img
    class=\\"aligncenter\\"
    src=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dropbox-step-1.png\\"
    alt=\\"Dropbox: share\\"
    title=\\"You need to hover over the file for the share button to appear\\"
  >
</p>
<p>
  Now you&#8217;ll see two options for sharing a link towards the bottom. 
You can grant edit access (&#8220;Can edit&#8221;), or read only access (&#8220;Can view&#8221;).
&#8220;Can view&#8221; is good enough for Beeminder&#8217;s purposes!

    alt=\\"Dropbox share: create a link\\"
    title=\\"Then you click on 'Copy link'\\"
  >
</p>
<p>
  Just like with Google Docs, this doesn&#8217;t mean your document is public.
  <a

    id=\\"PUB2\\"
    href=\\"#PUB\\"
  >
    [1]
  </a>
  Now click &#8220;Copy link&#8221; and, again, just like in the Google Docs instructions above, you&#8217;re ready to paste the URL of your document when Beeminder asks.
</p>
<h2>
  Mix and Match
</h2>
<p>
  You don&#8217;t have to choose between Google Docs and Dropbox.
You can beemind your total word count across any number of documents anywhere if you can point Beeminder at them.

    created your URLminder Beeminder goal
  </a>
  then you can add the URL in the goal settings, like so:
</p>
<p>
  <img
    class=\\"aligncenter\\"
    src=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2017-04-03-at-23.29.29-e1491289111618.png\\"
    alt=\\"URLminder settings\\"
    title=\\"You'll find this below your graph in the Settings tab\\"
  >
</p>
<p>
  You can remove URLs from that list too but usually you won&#8217;t want to since that makes your total word count drop and that may cause you to derail.
Of course if you accidentally do something like that, Beeminder is very nice and you won&#8217;t actually have to pay.
You&#8217;ll just have to

  and explain what happened.

  UPDATE:
We should&#8217;ve clarified that any documents you beemind by giving Beeminder a Dropbox link need to be plain text or similar.
We just naively count words based on what&#8217;s separated by spaces.
So things like Microsoft Word documents won&#8217;t work.
But HTML, for example, is fine; just that we&#8217;ll also count tags and things as if they&#8217;re words.
If there&#8217;s demand for specific file types, like Word, it may be easy for us to convert them on our end before doing the word counts.
Let us know!
</p>
<p>
  UPDATE 2020:
Google Docs and Dropbox changed their UIs for getting sharable links.
The above screenshots now reflect the latest.

  Google Docs and Dropbox and similar services give the option to share via a link or URL.
That means anyone with the URL can see your document, but it&#8217;s a secret and unguessable URL.
If you&#8217;re sufficiently paranoid then you might worry about Beeminder getting hacked or something.
But for most people you&#8217;re not exposing yourself to undue risk by getting a sharable link to a private document and giving it to Beeminder.

since this front page article doesn&#8217;t start talking about Beeminder until after the jump.
Also we&#8217;re about to demonstrate how little sense of humor we have in our next blog post in which we explain why the article 
(about how type A nerds are ruining the Ancient Eastern Art of meditation by gamifying it)
is All Wrong.
But for now we&#8217;ll just bask in the prestige of being written about in actual old-timey print.

  Until today Beeminder had a fundamental design flaw that was baked in from literally day one.
The first line of code for what would

    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/beenamer/\\"
    title=\\"Blog post about naming Beeminder Beeminder and what it started out as\\"
  >
    become Beeminder
  </a>
  was to draw a line on a graph in Mathematica from a target weight to a goal weight.
But
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/weighly\\"
    title=\\"Why Weigh (Daily)?\\"
  >
    weight fluctuates
  </a>
  , I thought to myself.
Or maybe I said it out loud to Bee, to which she would&#8217;ve nodded sagely at the seemingly innocuous fact.
So, we figured, let&#8217;s add some thickness to that line and say you just need to keep your weight measurements on that thicker line or below it.
We can color it yellow and call it the Yellow Brick Road.
</p>
<br>
<center>
  <em>
    insert record-scratching sound here
  </em>
</center>
<br>
<p>
  After killing baby Hitler, I&#8217;d say the next most important use for a time machine is to burst in on us at that moment and explain that, sure, weight fluctuates but you can&#8217;t just add thickness to either side of the line like that!
The line drawn on the graph has to be the critical edge, the bright line that you can&#8217;t cross.
</p>
<p>
  Do you see the problem with how we did it?
We defined the yellow brick road &#8212; the path from where you are today to your goal &#8212; in terms of the centerline but then allowed a fudge factor known as &#8220;the wrong lane&#8221;.
In the so-called wrong lane, you&#8217;d be off from the goal you set for yourself but within a window that Beeminder still considered &#8220;on the road&#8221;.
Besides violating
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/catchup/\\"
    title=\\"Catch-up Unmustered; or, Easier is Harder\\"
  >
    a fundamental tenet of Beeminder
  </a>
  it yielded a cascade of bugs and confusion and flat-out wrongness.
Like how if you dialed in a goal to do X things by time T, Beeminder enforced something slightly but infuriatingly different.
</p>
<h2>
  What does all this mean for actual users?
</h2>
<p>
  For one thing, let me make that last example more concrete.
Until now, if you wanted to, say, write 50,000 words in November, you&#8217;d end up only having written 48,333 words by the night of the 30th if you were edge-skating.
Now there&#8217;s no more falling behind into that spare lane-width of leeway. 
It means we don&#8217;t need three numbers telling us the distance to this lane vs. that lane, just the one clear number that tells us where we are from today&#8217;s requirements.
</p>
<p>
  Besides quashing whole categories of bugs and greater consistency and general elegance, though, you should notice surprisingly little!
We&#8217;ve worked our butts off to make the transition silky smooth.

  ).
And just because this is the blog of record for building Beeminder and this is a big deal for us, even if most of the work has involved minimizing the impact for you.
But it should also mean paving the way for big new features in the future.
Mostly, we&#8217;re really excited and wanted to share!
</p>
<h2>
  Can we get back to the excruciating details?
</h2>
<p>
  Sure!
The really insidious problems arose when you changed the steepness of your yellow brick road.
(And if you&#8217;re really just tuning in, that ability to change what you&#8217;ve committed to without defeating the whole point of a commitment device is another defining feature of Beeminder and you might want to read

    The Road Dial and the Akrasia Horizon
  </a>
  &#8221;.)
Another fundamental tenet of Beeminder is letting you build up safety buffer and always being crystal clear about how much time you have before you&#8217;ll be officially off track on your goal, i.e., off your road.
We color-coded that safety buffer &#8212; red for a beemergency, orange for beemergency eve, blue for 2 days of safety buffer, and green for 3+ days.
But the colors were fundamentally based on the regions of the graph: green for the good side of the road, blue for the good lane, orange for the wrong lane, red for being off the road (you have to claw your way back on by your deadline &#8212; that&#8217;s what a beemergency means).
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;We have finally peeled off the layers of duct tape and solved the root of these problems&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  For the colors based on days of safety buffer and the colors based on location on the graph to match, the width of the road was computed such that you&#8217;d go from the good side (green) to the good lane (blue) to the wrong lane (orange) to the wrong side (red) each a day apart.
The width had to be wider when the road was steeper and narrower when the road was shallower.
Technically, if the road was flat then it should&#8217;ve had no thickness at all.
But that was a big problem if you scheduled a flat spot on your road for a vacation.
It would mean that you could be skating the edge of your road, in the wrong lane, and then when your flat spot mercifully arrived, the road would shrink out from under you and you&#8217;d have to do an extra day&#8217;s work to get back onto it.
That was obviously no good so we made a special case: the width of the road on a flat spot was the max of the widths on either side of the flat spot.
Fine.
Except if you happened to schedule not a fully flat spot but just an almost flat spot, you&#8217;d be bitten in the butt by the shrinking road problem after all and it would all be a big bubbling pot of

    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/magic/\\"

  </a>
  putrescence.
(Maybe I&#8217;m overstating it now; we&#8217;re just so relieved to have finally peeled off the layers of duct tape and solved the root of these problems.)
</p>
<p>
  More generally, you just couldn&#8217;t rely on the colors Beeminder showed you to correspond with your actual amount of safety buffer on your goal.
Going into &#8220;the wrong lane&#8221; was perpetually messing that up on anything but the simplest graphs.
</p>
<p>
  The only way out of the mess we&#8217;d built for ourselves was to redesign how the yellow brick road worked.
We did this exceedingly carefully and painstakingly with the hopeful end result that casual users &#8212; in particular those with simple linear graphs &#8212; will hardly notice a difference.
</p>
<p>
  It started with a more careful separation of concerns between what we call Beebrain and Beebody.
We gradually got more and more logic &#8212; timezones,

The number of clusterfudgesicles &#8212; byproducts of forcing &#8220;lanes of the road&#8221; to work &#8212; that we had to gradually untangle was mildly staggering.

    Pareto Dominance Principle
  </a>
  :
When you create a goal now, it defaults to just one day of initial safety buffer instead of two.
(You can still pick any amount you like &#8212; this is just about the default if you don&#8217;t pick.)
It&#8217;s a little more natural this way, to have the razor road start exactly where you are today, with your initial datapoint right on it.

  UPDATE:
On this day, June 18, in the year of our Lord 2020, the last old-style non-YBHP lane-ridden graph was converted to the Yellow Brick Half-Plane New World Order.
Praise be!

  The story of the parameter known as &#8220;edgy&#8221; is just gobsmacking and epitomizes the elaborate ball of duct tape we backed ourselves inside of by not having a yellow brick half-plane from the start.
It&#8217;s too far into the weeds to be worth proper blogging but I&#8217;m including our dev notes about it in this footnote for posterity and just to marvel at:
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Suppose you start a pushups goal of 3/day but want the first 3 due on the first day. 
This means starting the centerline of the yellow brick road above the initial datapoint so the initial datapoint starts on the edge of the road. 
So an &#8220;edgy&#8221; goal is one where the initial point is on the bottom (or top, depending on &#8220;yaw&#8221;) edge of the road. 
That means moving the start of the road up (or down) by one lane width compared to where it would be if it started at the initial datapoint. 
But we have a chicken and egg problem: 
We need the road function in order to compute the lane width and we need the initial point, (tini,vini), to compute the road function. 
Which is to say, we need (tini,vini) to compute the lane width but we need the lane width to compute (tini,vini), to shift it.
      <br>
      &nbsp;
      <br>
      Solution (sort of): 
The lane width is generally equal to the daily rate of the road. 
So we can have the road start at the initial datapoint but one day earlier. 
I.e., (tini,vini) -= (86400,0). 
Then when we know the road function we can move tini forward a day and vini by the appropriate amount, 
vini = rdf(tini+86400).
      <br>
      &nbsp;
      <br>
      The only problem with this approach is that it only puts the initial datapoint at the edge if the rate of the first segment of the road is the same as the rate of the most recent datapoint, since it&#8217;s the rate there that determines the overall lane width. 
Trying to do this Really Right gets very messy or even impossible without introducing worse problems than the initial point not being on the actual edge.
      <br>
      &nbsp;
      <br>
      I think the right solution to the &#8216;edgy&#8217; confusion is to get rid of the edgy parameter &#8212; goals are always edgy. 
To get the edgy=false behavior, just use the road matrix to specify one initial flat day. 
And in fact goals should always have an initial road row that says rate 0 up till yesterday or today 
(because otherwise if you add a datapoint before the first datapoint then you&#8217;ll make the road change).
      <br>
      &nbsp;
      <br>
      [later] Bethany has now convinced me that edginess should not be in Beebrain&#8217;s purview. 
The start of the road is always given explicitly by tini and vini. 
When you create a goal that should be edgy you know the initial rate 
(e.g., the generous estimate that the user provides for Set-A-Limit [now do-less] goals) 
so you can can bump vini up by that amount. 
So we&#8217;re going to do that! 
Phew!

    Here&#8217;s a story from last week as I related it in a daily beemail the next day:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Bee and I had a fun night last night. 
While working on the Yellow Brick Half-Plane transition (did you see the news that all new goals are YBHP now? key milestone! we couldn&#8217;t turn back now even if we wanted to!) we accidentally shrank the roads on 1200 graphs before they were ready which caused about 100 of them &#8212; the edge-skaters &#8212; to instantly derail. 
So we had to painstakingly fix them and email everyone to apologize and assure them that they could ignore the accidental legit check they got, etc etc. 
(We think there was only one person who was about to derail anyway and was able to opportunistically get out of it due to our screw-up. 
For everyone else we got things fixed up in time.) 
About 9 person-hours of work from one tiny bug. 
I guess we&#8217;ve seen a lot worse!

    won&#8217;t
  </em>
  do, not without re-engineered incentives!
</p>
<p>
  But I actually agree with both of those wisdom nuggets and even think they&#8217;re instances of the same general principle.
</p>
<p>
  The standard story of akrasia is that I delusionally think I can screw around now and be more productive tomorrow (or next week).
I&#8217;m hyperbolically discounting and prioritizing immediate pleasure and deferring pain.
</p>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;For the exact same reason, I both procrastinate and overcommit&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  Similarly, when someone asks me to commit to something, I have a strong immediate desire to make them happy and say yes.
Disappointing people feels horrible. 
So, for the exact same reason, I both procrastinate and overcommit.
I don&#8217;t overcommit to myself, just to other people.
For self-originating commitments it&#8217;s the hassle of committing that&#8217;s most salient.
Not bothering is easiest in the moment. 
I need to lock myself in.
For other-originating commitments it&#8217;s the pain of disappointing someone that&#8217;s most salient.
It&#8217;s easiest to say yes now and worry about the consequences in the future.
</p>
<p>
  In short, I&#8217;m tempted to say no to my suggestions to myself of new commitments and I&#8217;m tempted to say yes to others.

trick for overcoming that immediate ugh-reaction and getting myself on the hook for things
  <em>
    I
  </em>
  want to commit to. 
And hence also Tim Harford’s heuristic for defending against the temptation to say yes in the moment (and avoid the pain of saying no) to all those potential commitments to others that future-me will have to worry about making good on.

  PS: Caveats and Advice-Reversal
</h2>
<p>
  As with most advice given blindly, some people may do better to

    reverse this advice
  </a>
  . 
You know who you are.
Creating a Beeminder goal every time the whim strikes could be a recipe for Beeminder Burnout for some folks.
(Presumably some people should apply Scott Alexander&#8217;s
advice-reversing advice
to Tim Harford&#8217;s heuristic as well.)
But I think it&#8217;s possible to get the best of both worlds.
As we explain in our old blog post about it,

    title=\\"Excerpt: Think of Beeminder as your insurance policy against falling below a minimum awesomeness threshold.\\"
  >
    beating Beeminder burnout
  </a>
  doesn&#8217;t have to mean beeminding fewer things, just beeminding less so.
Follow Adam&#8217;s advice and create every Beeminder goal that pops into your head, with the 30 days&#8217; buffer, and also do
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/calendial\\"

That way you can beemind All The Things, but very gradually and nonstressfully (or at

  If that didn&#8217;t help, then try this:
Zapier is a way to get disparate apps to talk to each other.
Define an event in one app as a trigger and define a corresponding action in another app.
We use Zapier, for example, to cause tweets mentioning Beeminder to show up in our Hipchat.
It&#8217;s brilliant and powerful and we&#8217;re exceedingly proud to announce that Beeminder is now officially integrated with Zapier.
</p>
<p>
  This is an especially big deal for Beeminder because it opens up a world of new autodata sources for beeminding.
</p>
<h3>
  Beeminder Reprise
</h3>
<p>
  For those just tuning in, Beeminder is a Quantified Self tool for tracking your progress toward goals.
Well, that&#8217;s half of it.
The other half is that we let you hard-commit to staying on track toward those goals, by pledging actual money.
We make pretty (nerdy) graphs, plotting your progress along a Yellow Brick Road.
If you stay on track from the start then you&#8217;ll never pay anything for Beeminder,
  <s>
    or even have to put in a credit card
  </s>
  .
[UPDATE: Silly past-us, it&#8217;s definitely important to put in a payment method
  <em>
    before
  </em>
  you derail.
We now call this the
  <a
    href=\\"https://blog.beeminder.com/commitwall\\"
    title=\\"Commitwall: No More Beeminding Without A Way To Be Charged Money\\"
  >
    Commitwall
  </a>
  .]
But the first time you go off track is when you&#8217;ll have to put your money where your mouth is if you want to keep beeminding.
</p>
<p>
  So automatic sources of data are a big deal, both for removing the friction of tracking, and for
  <em>
    adding
  </em>
  friction for
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/cheating\\"
    title=\\"Beeminder blog post about combatting cheating\\"
  >
    cheating
  </a>
  .
</p>
<p>
  There are still plenty of ways to cheat of course, and people first encountering Beeminder often focus on that.
Why would you possibly be willing to pay some company because you screwed up on your goal, they ask.
Well, long-time Beeminder users tell us that the monetary stings (get it?) are well worth it for all the awesomeness we induce the rest of the time.
But if the thought of having to pay money is too scary, that&#8217;s perfect: you&#8217;ll be very motivated to keep all your datapoints on your yellow brick road.
Again, we
  <s>
    don&#8217;t even
  </s>
  do ask for a credit card
  <s>
    until
  </s>
  before the first time you go off track.
(The other reason we see surprisingly little cheating on Beeminder is that the whole concept holds no appeal in the first place if you&#8217;re the cheating type.
Hooray

<h3>
  Triggers and Actions
</h3>
<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;Maybe you want to do more writing and you save your drafts in a Dropbox folder&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  So far the Zapier/Beeminder integration works in one direction: 
define
  <em>
    triggers
  </em>
  from other apps that cause an
  <em>
    action
  </em>
  on Beeminder.
The action on Beeminder is always the same: add a datapoint to a graph.
The triggers can be anything: 
Adding hours in
  <a
    href=\\"https://zapier.com/zapbook/toggl/beeminder/37796/toggl-new-time-entry-to-beeminder-add-datapoint/\\"
    title=\\"You probably want new timer entries as the trigger event and to send the duration in hours to Beeminder\\"
  >
    Toggl
  </a>
  or
  <a
    href=\\"https://zapier.com/app/min/301/start\\"
    title=\\"You probably want to track hours (total or for specific projects), similar to Toggl\\"
  >
    Harvest
  </a>
  , 
adding tasks in
  <a
    href=\\"https://zapier.com/app/min/302/start\\"
    title=\\"You probably want to count todos completed, sending a +1 to Beeminder each time\\"
  >
    Todoist
  </a>
  , 
adding new files in
  <a
    href=\\"https://zapier.com/app/min/336/start\\"
    title=\\"You probably want to count new files added to a given directory, possibly filtered for file type, sending a +1 to Beeminder each time, or perhaps the number of bytes in the file being added, as a way to beemind, say, total amount of writing\\"
  >
    Dropbox
  </a>
  .
</p>
<p>
  The Dropbox example is particularly powerful and general since &#8220;adding a new file in Dropbox&#8221; can mean so many different things.
Maybe you want to beemind how many pictures you take and you have pictures automatically uploading to Dropbox.
Or maybe you want to do more writing and you save your drafts in a Dropbox folder.
Zapier lets you filter by directory, filename, file attributes (like size and type), you name it.
And you can beemind either number of files or total number of bytes.
So many possibilities!
</p>
<h3>
  Zapminder! Setting Up Zaps to Feed the Bee
</h3>
<p>
  To get started creating a zap, pick the trigger app and what event in that app should trigger a new datapoint.
The action is Beeminder and &#8220;Add Datapoint&#8221; is the only action.
It looks like this:
</p>
<p>
  <img
    class=\\"aligncenter\\"
    alt=\\"Screenshot for choosing the trigger and action on Zapier\\"
    title=\\"Screenshot for choosing the trigger and action on Zapier\\"
    src=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/zapier-screenshot-trigger-action.png\\"
  >
</p>
<p>
  Then you give Zapier permission to see your data in the app (Toggl in this example) and similarly for Beeminder.
Then you choose what data gets sent to Beeminder, like this:
</p>
<p>
  <img
    class=\\"aligncenter\\"
    alt=\\"Screenshot for choosing the fields via Zapier for creating datapoints on Beeminder\\"
    title=\\"Screenshot for choosing the fields via Zapier for creating datapoints on Beeminder\\"
    src=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/zapier-screenshot-fields.png\\"
  >
</p>
<p>
  For many kinds of zapminding the datapoint value will simply be &#8220;1&#8221;.
Like if you completed a task on Todoist then every time that event triggers you&#8217;re sending a +1 to Beeminder.
</p>
<h3>
  Zapminding Down to the Wire
</h3>
<p>
  Beeminder&#8217;s all about setting a bright line in the sand.
There&#8217;s a hard deadline by which you must finish what you said you would.
Zapier syncs every 5 or 15 minutes (depending on if you have a paid plan).
Either way, that can be a problem if you&#8217;re working up to the literal last minute.
One answer is, don&#8217;t do that!
If you make sure to do the bare minimum Beeminder specifies by 15 minutes before the deadline, you should be fine.
But hardcore Beeminder users often find themselves down to the wire.
If that&#8217;s you, you can force a sync from Zapier to make sure you&#8217;re safely on Beeminder&#8217;s yellow brick road before the deadline.
</p>
<p>
  Do that by clicking the red Zapier icon above your graph:
</p>
<p>
  <img
    class=\\"aligncenter\\"
    alt=\\"Screenshot for the button in Beeminder that takes you to your Zapier dashboard to force a sync of your data\\"
    title=\\"Screenshot for the button in Beeminder that takes you to your Zapier dashboard to force a sync of your data\\"
    src=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/zapier-screenshot-icon.png\\"
  >
</p>
<p>
  That will take you to your Zapier dashboard where you can force the zap to run like so:
</p>
<p>
  <img
    class=\\"aligncenter\\"
    alt=\\"Screenshot for the Zapier dashboard for forcing a sync of your data, i.e., forcing your zap to run\\"
    title=\\"Screenshot for the Zapier dashboard for forcing a sync of your data, i.e., forcing your zap to run\\"
    src=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/zapier-screenshot-run.png\\"
  >
</p>
<p>
  We&#8217;re working on a way to automatically trigger a sync from Zapier right at your deadline.
(We may also work around the problem by adding a grace period where data from Zapier that&#8217;s up to 15 minutes late still counts as under the wire.)
As soon as we do then Zapier-mediated beeminding will be every bit as good as our official integrations.
For all but the most extreme procrastinators it already is!
</p>
<p>
  So, dive in, and let us know what zaps you create!
Here are a few you can start with:

  >
    crash of ineptitude
  </a>
  so it&#8217;s time to disabuse you of the notion that we may have gotten our act together since then!
</p>
<p>
  The backstory is that we&#8217;ve been fortunate enough to have some scaling challenges 
&#8212; mostly due to our
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/weusethat\\"
    title=\\"Beeminder&#39;s tech stack\\"
  >
    ridiculous architecture
  </a>
  &#8212;
so we decided we could cut way down on our automatic checks for new data 
(for goals with
  <a href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/tag/integrations\\">
    automatic data sources
  </a>
  ; see also the list on the
  <a href=\\"http://beeminder.com\\">
    beeminder.com
  </a>
  front page)
by introducing a refresh button on the goal page.
We went from automatic hourly checks to only checking once a day, with the consolation that you can hit that refresh button at any time to see exactly where you stand right now.
</p>
<p>
  That change led to a lot of problems.
We even briefly had a bug where your graph could show up orange or blue or green all day (if you didn&#8217;t refresh it, which we had trained people to not worry about doing!) and then suddenly derail at midnight.
We fixed that one the same day but it was only the tip of the iceberg.

    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/gmailzero\\"
    title=\\"Blog post introducing GmailZero -- see also gmailzero.com\\"
  >
    GmailZero
  </a>
  users were most thrown by the changes, both because inbox counts can fluctuate wildly and because the bot used to relentlessly bug you on emergency days for GmailZero goals.
</p>
<p>
  If your
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/beenamer\\"
    title=\\"Blog post about the name &#39;Beeminder&#39;\\"
  >
    name
  </a>
  is &#8220;Beeminder&#8221; then reminders really need to be part of your core competency!
So we refunded all the pledges for recent GmailZero derailments.
  <strong>
    If you derailed due (even in part) to lack of bot reminders and you didn&#8217;t get an email

    .
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  That brings us to our new feature, which we hope is going to be the best of all worlds: Zeno polling.
The bot bugs you at whatever time you&#8217;ve chosen (9:30am by default, in your local timezone) but if it&#8217;s an emergency day it refuses to give up.
  <a
    class=\\"footnote\\"

  </a>
  It schedules another reminder half-way between that initial reminder time and midnight. 
When that reminder goes out, if you&#8217;re still not on your road, it schedules another, again, halfway between now and midnight. 
This repeats until you get yourself on the yellow brick road, or until midnight is reached.
If midnight

<h4 class=\\"pullquote\\">
  &#8220;If it&#8217;s an emergency day the bot refuses to give up.&#8221;
</h4>
<p>
  To the uninitiated, this may seem super spammy but what the uninitiated don&#8217;t appreciate is ohmygod you&#8217;re about to derail!!
It works especially well for GmailZero since you&#8217;re in your inbox anyway, hustling to get enough messages archived, so those reminders are timely and helpful as you get down to the wire.
(And recall that they don&#8217;t count against you if you ignore them, since only Read messages count for
  <a
    href=\\"http://blog.beeminder.com/gmailzero\\"
    title=\\"Blog post introducing GmailZero\\"
  >
    GmailZero
  </a>
  .)
</p>
<p>
  Since GmailZero in fact used to work this way, and we personally liked it, we&#8217;re turning this on by default for GmailZero goals.
For other goals &#8212; even goals with manual data entry &#8212; you can turn this on in your email settings.
If the goal has an automatic data source then this feature means we update your graph on emergency days more and more often as midnight approaches.
If the goal is manual, this feature merely spams the crap out of you as you come down to the wire on an emergency day.
Think of it as added inducement to get your beemergencies dispatched earlier in the day.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    UPDATE 2013-11-13
  </strong>
  : Zeno polling is now on by default for new goals.
  <br>
  <strong>
    UPDATE 2015-09-30
  </strong>
  : Zeno polling is now not only on by default but we make it purposefully rather non-obvious how to turn it off. 
(Answer: make your Zeno start time be 1 minute before your deadline, or set your number of days lead time for getting reminders to -1).
We think the right way to stop Zeno polling is to dispatch your damn beemergency (i.e., get back on the yellow brick road) and if you disagree we want you to prove you&#8217;ve thought about it!

    We just frantically deployed this and are scrambling to make sure reality matches this blog post.
We&#8217;re especially nervous about turning this on by default for all GmailZero users but will do so shortly, after a bit more testing.
We would&#8217;ve waited one more day but there&#8217;s

    riding on publishing this by midnight!
We&#8217;ll replace this sentence with an update when we&#8217;re reasonably sure all systems are go with zeno polling.
UPDATE: I feel weird doing silent edits (especially after that sentence stood for days longer than I intended) so I&#8217;m instead appending this sentence to say that all systems are go: on by default for gmailzero and you can turn it on for any other goal.

    Gollwitzer et al&#8217;s paper
  </a>
  about, as the internet interpreted it, keeping your goals to yourself.
I think I&#8217;ve heard variants of &#8220;did you hear that science shows that you&#8217;re more likely to achieve your goals if you don&#8217;t tell anyone?&#8221; many dozens of times in the last decade.
The hand-wavy theory is that telling people about a goal gives you some kind of dopamine hit just by feeling like the kind of person who has such a goal and this reduces your motivation to actually achieve the goal.
</p>
<p>
  (I don&#8217;t want to be too mean to these poor researchers but Gollwitzer et al seems like the epitome of a pre-replication-crisis psychology paper.
Right in the abstract you can see tell-tale signs of p-hacking:
&#8220;This effect held among participants with strong but not weak commitment to the identity goal.&#8221;)
</p>
<p>
  The keep-your-goals-to-yourself interpretation seems to have been
  <a href=\\"https://sivers.org/zipit\\">
    popularized by Derek Sivers
  </a>
  (especially in
  <a href=\\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHopJHSlVo4\\">
    a TED talk
  </a>
  ).
Sivers himself seems to have regretted how his talk was interpreted and 
[posted a semi-retraction](
  <a href=\\"https://sivers.org/zipit2\\">
    https://sivers.org/zipit2
  </a>
  &#8220;[identity goals are] usually related to personal development, that would make you a slightly different person if completed.&#8221;&#8221;
) wherein he clarifies that the study he&#8217;s referencing is only about
  <em>
    identity goals
  </em>
  :
goals where telling people about the goal is part of what the goal is.
If your goal is to be a runner, you&#8217;re making that part of your identity by declaring it out loud, which, I guess is now sort of more true by having said it? 
(Wait, why are my hands waving?)
</p>
<p>
  If I&#8217;ve now made you scared to tell your friends about your important life goals, I&#8217;m doing a really bad job here.
Sivers, too, tries to address that at the end of his TED talk by suggesting that you state goals in a way that &#8220;gives you no satisfaction&#8221;:
Like, &#8220;I really want to run this marathon, so I need to train 5 times a week, and kick my ass if I don&#8217;t!&#8221; 
But notice what he did there? 
He just took the goal &#8220;I want to be a marathon runner!&#8221; and

  </a>
  it up, turning it into a specific, measurable, task.
And he threw in a Beemindery sting there at the end to boot.
So maybe instead of tying yourself in knots about word choice, just beemind your goals.
</p>
<p>
  Identity-based goal or not, the conclusion that you make yourself less likely to achieve a goal by telling people about it defies common sense. 
Especially for any goal that people beemind, you&#8217;re well advised to shout it from the rooftops.
