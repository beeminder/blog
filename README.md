# blog

The
[actual blog](https://blog.beeminder.com "Beeminder blog!")
isn't in GitHub currently (it's hosted by WP Engine) but ideas for new blog posts live here as gissues.
I curate the collection via
[freshgishing](https://www.beeminder.com/d/freshblog "Danny's Beeminder goal for curating the collection of blog post drafts and notes")
aka
[backlog freshening](https://blog.beeminder.com/freshen/ "Nerd version; see also the sequel post").

## Development

```bash
nvm use
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
pnpm run test
```

## Production

Commits merged to `master` are automatically deployed via <render.com>.
